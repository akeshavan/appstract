A scoping review was performed to examine the efficacy of VR-based interventions on balance and mobility disorders post stroke. Twenty-four articles in the English language examining VR game-based interventions and outcomes directed at balance and mobility disorders were included. Various VR systems (customized and commercially available) were used as rehabilitation tools. Outcome measures included laboratory and clinical measures of balance and gait. Outcome measures of dynamic balance showed significant improvements following VR-based interventions as compared to other interventions. Further, it was observed that VR-based intervention may have favorable effects in improving walking speed and the ability to deal with environmental challenges, which may also facilitate independent community ambulation. VR-based therapy thus has the potential to be a useful tool for balance and gait training for stroke rehabilitation. Utilization of motor learning principles related to task-related training may have been an important factor leading to positive results. Other principles such as repetition, feedback etc. were used in studies but were not explored explicitly and may need to be investigated to further improve the strength of results. Lastly, robust study designs with appropriate attention towards the intensity and dose-response aspects of VR training, clear study objectives and suitable outcomes would further aid in determining evidence-based efficacy for VR game-based interventions in the future.KeywordsBalance deficitsCerebrovascular accidentGaitGait retrainingGame-based rehabilitationPhysiotherapyPostureRehabilitationStrokeVirtual realityissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2015ReviewSearch strategyOVID MEDLINE, OVID EMBASE, PUBMED and PSYCINFO databases were searched using the terms “rehabilitation”, “virtual reality”, “stroke”, “balance”, “gait” etc. between the periods January 1950 to December 2013.

Studies that were not published in the English language, available as abstracts only, that did not include post-stroke individuals or included a mixed etiology sample without separate description of outcomes related to the stroke sample, were excluded. Studies that - 1) used VR as a training tool for balance and mobility, 2) reported at least one outcome related to gait or balance and 3) published in the English language were included.The included articles were scrutinised to extract information about VR systems, the training paradigms, outcomes and results. Twenty-four studies that met the inclusion criteria were retained for this scoping review. The subsequent sub-sections provide a synopsis of the study design, virtual environments (VE), outcome measures and the findings.Study designsOf the included studies, eleven were small RCTs (Level II evidence according to CEBM levels of evidence [27]) [28-38], four were controlled trials with concurrent control group (Level III evidence) [39-42], two studies had no [43] or a historical control group (Level IV evidence) [44] and six studies presented non-empirical evidence consisting of case reports, case series or proof-of-principle studies (Level V evidence) [10,45-50]. The proportion of RCTs has shown a consistent rise over the years, suggesting an increase in methodological rigor of studies in the field.Participant characteristicsSome variability with respect to subject characteristics was observed among the included studies. Fifteen studies [28-35,38-40,42,45,47,49,50] recruited subjects with chronic stroke, seven [10,36,41,43,44,48] with sub-acute to chronic stroke, one [37] with acute stroke and one study did not provide information stroke chronicity [46]. Most studies included individuals between the ages of 50 and 80 years. Further, four studies [34-37] recruited in-patients receiving rehabilitation, twelve [10,28,30,38-40,42,45-48,50] recruited community-dwelling participants while seven studies [29,31,32,41,43,44,49] did not provide these details. A typical sample in most studies was thus middle-aged and old, community-dwelling chronic stroke survivors.VR systemsBoth custom-made and commercially available VR systems were used in studies (Table 2). Custom-made systems were usually laboratory specific and often combined other devices with the VR interface such as robotic devices [31,33,45] treadmills [10,30,34,40,43] and others. Among commercially available systems, two studies used the Interactive Rehabilitation and Exercise system, developed to comply with specific rehabilitation requirements and customization according to the patient’s needs [29,32]. Seven studies used over the counter gaming consoles such as the Nintendo Wii™, Sony Playstation™ or the Kinect™ systems [35,37-39,41,42,47]. These are designed for the general population but are being increasingly used for rehabilitation.Table 2

Experimental group: additional 30-minVR training thrice a week for 6 weeks.Feasel et al. (2011) [49] and Lewek et al. (2012) [50]Integrated Virtual Environment Rehabilitation Treadmill (IVERT) system consisting of an instrumented dual-belt treadmill coupled to an immersive VE. The treadmill utilized a control algorithm to drive the treadmill speed in congruence with the user’s gait speed (estimated from the ground reaction force). VE consisted of a park with rolling hills, trees, rocks and a trail lined with fence posts. The VE was displayed with the help of three short-throw projectors that were mounted in front of a three-panel display placed a distance of 1.2 m from the front and 0.9 m at the sides respectively. The combined image display had a 170° horizontal and 60° vertical field-of-view. Asymmetry in gait was portrayed as a curved path in the VE and users were encouraged to maintain a straight path during trials.Feasel et al.: One session consisting of 20-40 min of treadmill walking. Lewek et al.: Two post-stroke individuals performed 18 sessions over 6 weeks consisting of 20 min walking with the IVERT system followed by 10-15 min of overground walking. Each session lasted for 60 min (patient 1) or 45 min (patient 2).Jung et al. (2012) [40]The set-up consisted of a treadmill and an HMD through the virtual scene was displayed. The virtual scene consisted of a park stroll. The HMD displayed a 100-inch screen and had built-in earphones. Further information about the virtual scene and synchronization of the treadmill with the VR was not provided.Experimental group: Treadmill walking with VR 30 min/day, 5 days/week for 5 weeks. Control group: treadmill walking without VR, following the same schedule as for experimental group.Kim et al. (2012) [41]Nintendo Wii sports software to play games involving tennis and boxing. The Wii games were displayed on a 30-inch TV display placed at 60 cm above the ground atop which was mounted the motion sensor. The motion sensor communicated with a remote that was either held on or strapped to the unaffected hand of the stroke subjects. Both games required varied motion and acceleration patterns to succeed.Both groups received general exercises (not specified) for 30 min and electrical stimulation to the tibialis anterior muscle on the paretic side for 15 min. The experimental group received additional VR training for 30 min/session, three times a week for 3 weeks.Cho et al. (2013) [36]The set-up utilized a treadmill, a laptop, projector and speakers. The laptop was used to project real-world video recordings (VRRW) on to the projector which consisted of 10-min recordings of a 400 m walk track, a rainy 400 m walking track, a 400 m walking track with obstacles, walk in the community during daytime and nighttime and walking on a trail. Each recording was repeated thrice during the 30 min training period.Both groups: standard rehabilitation program, 80 min per day, 5 times a week for 6 weeks. Experimental group: VRRW training, 30 min a day, 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Control group: treadmill training without VR for similar duration.Fritz et al. (2013) [38]Nintendo Wii (Wii sports and Wii Fit) as well as Playstation (Eyetoy play and Kinect) gaming systems were used to train the experimental group. The Wii Fit and Kinect were marketed as physical activity whereas Wii sports and Eyetoy were marketed as ‘fun-based’ games. The patients were encouraged to operate both systems on their own.Control group: no intervention VR group: 50- 1 hour sessions consisting of 25-30 min physical activity and 25-30 min fun-based games. Frequency: 4 days/week for 5 weeks.Rajaratnam et al. (2013) [37]Nintendo Wii-fit and the Kinect gaming system were used to train the experimental group. Games that required subjects to shift weight in standing (Wii Fit and Kinect) and sitting (Kinect only) were used for training.Control group: 60 minutes of conventional rehabilitation per session for 15 sessions. Experimental group: 40 min of conventional rehabilitation + 20 min of VR training per session for 15 sessions.Singh et al., (2013) [42]Nintendo Wii Fit plus with Balance Board: Balance Bubble game Xbox 360 Kinect: Rally Ball game, individuals who scored a gold medal on this game progressed on to the Reflex Ridge game.Control group: standard group exercise therapy 2 hour sessions 2 times per week for 6 weeks. Experimental group: 90 minutes of standard group exercise + 30 min of VR balance games, 15 min each on the WiiFit and Xbox Kinect, twice per week for 6 weeks.VR-based interventionsVR tasks: The tasks used in the studies generally reflected the training objectives. For instance, studies aimed at improving balance utilized balance training tasks [32,35,37,38,41,46,47] while those aimed at improving gait utilized treadmill walking [10,28,30,36,40,43,49,50] or components of gait training such as ankle range of motion (ROM), strength [31,33,45] or appropriate activation/deactivation of ankle muscles [48].Training dosage: Most studies used training sessions lasting 40-60 min (Table 2). Some studies employed shorter (20 min) training sessions [30,34]. The training frequency varied from 2-5 times per week and total training duration lasted between 2-8 weeks. Consequently, the total VR intervention showed a wide variation ranging between 2 to 22 hours. Typical training doses comprised of sessions of 40-60 min duration, 3-5 times per week for 3-6 weeks.Feedback: Apart from the obvious intrinsic visual feedback perceived from the VE, additional intrinsic auditory, somatosensory or proprioceptive information were manipulated in some studies. For instance, Fung et al. [10] used a six-degree of freedom motion platform to simulate slopes in the VE to impart proprioceptive information congruent to walking on inclined surfaces, while Deutsch et al. [45] used haptic inputs to simulate turbulence or sensation of collision. This multisensory feedback could have acted as an important facilitator of intrinsic learning of the tasks, while enhancing engagement with the VE. Some studies also provided additional extrinsic feedback through knowledge of performance (KP) or knowledge of results (KR). Nine studies provided both KR and KP [10,29,31,32,38,43-46], three studies provided only KR [28,41,47], while others [30,34-37,40,42,48] did not provide or report on provision of KR/KP feedback. KP was provided either by the system [10,29,32,43,45,46] through graphs depicting an outcome or movement quality, or from verbal feedback (about movement quality, area of improvement etc.) by the therapists present during training [31,38,44]. KR was usually provided by the system as visual (e.g. success scores, placards) or auditory (e.g. cheering and other sounds) feedback.Other motor learning principles such as motivation, variable practice, and attention through enhanced engagement were not addressed explicitly in most studies. [Table 2].Outcome measuresThe outcome measures utilized in the studies reflected body function and activities domain of the International Classification of Function (ICF [51]) and comprised of both laboratory measures and clinical tests. Balance assessment included center of pressure (CoP) measurements (CoP sway, sway velocity etc.) during static (quiet standing) [32,34,35,46], and dynamic postural tasks [34,36] as well as clinical tests such as the Berg Balance Score (BBS) [32,35-38,43,44,47]. Gait related outcomes were commonly measured during overground walking (reflecting transfer of VR training to overground gait) and included gait speed [28,30-32,34,36,38,39,42-44,48-50], spatiotemporal gait parameters (stride length, step length, cadence etc.) [28,31,32,34,36,49,50] and kinematic as well as kinetic gait parameters [33,48]. Clinical tests such as Timed-Up and Go (TUG) test [35,36,38,42,44,46,47], the 6-minute walk test [28,31,38,39,42,47] and Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) [29,31] were also reported.Two studies measured ambulation in the community environment. Yang et al. [30] used the community walk test (time taken to walk 400 m in a community environment) while Mirelman et al. [31] reported on community walking activity (number of steps/day, average daily distance walked, speed, cadence etc.) using the Patient Activity Monitor. In addition, few studies reported outcomes reflecting challenges encountered during community ambulation. For e.g. Jaffe et al. [28] reported the obstacle test (the longest obstacle successfully crossed among a range of obstacle heights and lengths) and Fung et al. [10] reported on meeting time constraints, slope walking and obstacle avoidance. The details of all the outcomes reported can be found in Table 3.Table 3

However, positive comments about having visual feedback (walking in the VE) and having a visual goal (keeping the walking path straight) were received. Lewek et al.: 1) Patient 1 improved the CGS from 0.49 m/s (using a large-base quad cane) to 0.84 m/s post-training (without using a cane). This improvement was preserved over the follow-up. The FGS also improved from 0.56 m/s pre-training to 0.95 m/s post-training. Similar results were seen with patient 2, CGS improved from 1.02 m/s pre-training to 1.28 m/s post-training (retained on follow-up) while FGS improved from 1.71 to 1.88 m/s (retained on follow-up). 2) Step-length symmetry improved from 1.52 to 1.32 (with cane) and 1.18 (without cane) in patient 1.

However, no difference between control and experimental groups were found post-training on any outcome.Effectiveness of VR-based interventionsVarying results were obtained in CoP measures comparing VR-based interventions with non-VR-based interventions. While no significant differences among VR-based and other interventions were found for CoP measures during static balance tasks, significant differences between interventions were noted in these measures during dynamic balance tasks. For example, Yang et al. [34] found a significant improvement in bilateral symmetry and CoP excursion under the paretic leg during the sit-to-stand task, while Kim et al. [32] reported a significant improvement in sway angles during a dynamic weight shift task only following a VR-based intervention. Similarly, for clinical measures of balance, five studies reported significant improvements in BBS scores [32,35,36,43,47] and two studies [37,47] reported an improvement on the Functional Reach Test following VR intervention as compared to other interventions.Ten of the fourteen studies that reported gait speed found significant increases after VR-based intervention in comparison with other interventions. In addition, significant improvements in other spatiotemporal gait parameters such as cadence [32], step length [32,36,50], step time [32], stride length [36] and gait symmetry [50] as well as improvements in ankle, knee and hip ROM, and greater ankle moment and power were found following VR-based intervention [33,48] over other interventions. (Please see Table 3 for a detailed account of the results).Further, we examined study outcomes using our criteria for independent community ambulation. Participants from four studies were able to achieve an average gait speed of ≥ 0.8 m/s following VR intervention [30,31,36,38]. Also, among participants who received VR-based intervention, 3/5 participants from You et al. [29] and 4/9 participants from Mirelman et al. [31] achieved an FAC of 5 placing them in the unlimited community ambulation category. In addition, when gait measures included community walking, Yang et al. [30] and Mirelman et al. [31] found significant increases in community ambulation time and community ambulation distance and speed respectively following VR intervention. Furthermore, Jaffe et al. [28] and Fung et al. [10] also found improvements in the ability to negotiate perturbations encountered in the community such as slopes and obstacles. An increase in gait speed of ≥ 0.8 m/s, improvement on FAC, improvement in community ambulation measures, as well as increased competency in dealing with environmental perturbations, could lead to independent community ambulation in some participants. These improvements were not seen following other interventions, suggesting an added advantage of VR-based interventions over other interventions in facilitating independent community ambulation.One study [29] explored the effect of VR intervention on cortical re-organization post-stroke, wherein a significant shift from bilateral (pre-training) to ipsilesional (post-training) activation of the primary sensory-motor cortex during walking-like movements was found, suggesting that VR-based training can facilitate neuroplastic changes in the cortex.AbbreviationsVRVirtual realityVEVirtual environmentRCTRandomized controlled trialTUGTimed Up and GoBBSBerg balance scoreCoPCenter of pressureFACFunctional ambulation categoryROMRange of motionCompeting interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.Authors’ contributionsAD conceptualized, designed, carried out the review and drafted the manuscript.

In sheep, both maternal undernutrition around the time of conception and a high plane of nutrition in a young mother still growing herself result in impaired maternal metabolic adaptation to pregnancy, and hence greater substrate distribution to maternal at the expense of conceptus tissue accretion. Maternal nutrition in early pregnancy also determines subsequent growth and body composition of the offspring, with mild-moderate maternal undernutrition resulting in offspring of normal body weight at birth but with increased weight of fat depots thereafter. Undernutrition in late pregnancy commonly reduces offspring birthweight, and this in turn affects later growth and body composition. After birth, growth of different tissues is strongly influenced by both prior and current nutritional experiences. Lambs of lower birthweight take longer to start to gain weight after birth. They also require a higher feed intake to attain a given weight gain, and more of that weight is gained as fat and less as muscle compared with lambs of higher birthweight. However for a given birthweight, slower postnatal weight gain is generally associated with a proportionately greater muscle growth. Rate of growth also determines other aspects of body composition. Muscle fibre number, which limits final muscle size, is generally determined before birth, and indeed before the last trimester of pregnancy in many species. Lambs growing rapidly either before or after birth tend to have proportionately larger livers, whereas chronically slow growth is associated with reduced liver size relative to body weight. Similar patterns are seen in the lymphoreticular tissues such as spleen and thymus. It seems likely that these variations in body composition will have important functional consequences for later health and wellbeing.Early Growth and Body Composition of AdolescentsL A Moreno1, I Labayen21E.U. Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad de Zaragoza, Zaragoza, Spain, 2Department of Nutrition and Food Science, University of The Basque Country, Vitoria, SpainBackground and AimsThere are critical periods during childhood that influence the development of obesity, including gestation and early infancy. Size at birth and early postnatal growth are determinants of adult height and body mass index. The aim of this study was to assess if birth weight has any effect on body composition and/or fat distribution in adolescents.MethodsBody composition was assessed by both skinfold thickness measurements and dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in 234 adolescents born at term (140 females and 94 males), now aged 13–18 y and living in the city of Zaragoza (AVENA-Zaragoza cohort). Relative fat distribution was estimated with the ratio of the subscapular to triceps skinfolds (S/T). Birth weight and gestational age were assessed by means of a questionnaire, considering the paediatric neonatal records.Programming of Obesity and Insulin Resistance: The Effect of Early Catch up Growth — Lessons from Animal ModelsC Remacle, B ReusensInstitute of Life Science, University of Louvain, Louvain-la-Neuve, BelgiumBackground and AimsA body of evidence now suggests that poor intrauterine milieu elicited by maternal nutritional disturbance or placental insufficiency may programme susceptibility in the fetus to later develop chronic degenerative disease such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension and cardio-vascular disease. The compatibility of early postnatal nutrition with fetal experience will also be decisive for the rate of occurrence of degenerative disease.MethodsThe understanding of mechanisms underlying the programming of the metabolic syndrome is now progressing thanks to animal studies in which the fetal and neonatal environment has been manipulated.Human Genome: Implications for Clinical PracticeJ-J CassimanCenter for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, BelgiumThe complete and detailed sequence of a representative sample of human DNA is almost fully known, except for a few stretches of hard to sequence DNA. This historic achievement has already generated a few surprises. The number of genes (about 25,000) hidden in the 3 billion nucleotides that make up the human genome is much smaller than initially expected and is only slightly higher than in flies, while the total protein coding sequence is only about 3% of the genome. The OMIM register at www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/ lists more than 12,000 entries for monogenic or Mendelian diseases, including 60 mitochondrial diseases. More than 7,000 of these have been already mapped to a particular chromosomal region, while another 2,000 have a definite gene locus. The remaining entries are only phenotypic descriptions or other entries. The molecular basis of these diseases is rapidly being uncovered. In some genes one or a few defects are responsible for a particular phenotype; in others, mutations can be scattered all over the gene e.g. the more than 1000 different mutations in the CFTR gene in cystic fibrosis. The majority of our normal traits and diseases are inherited in a multifactorial fashion. This means that a series of genes (usually tens of genes) are involved, due to either normal variation in their sequence or real dysfunctional mutations. In addition, environmental factors modulate the way in which these genes influence the final phenotype. Traits inherited in this fashion are mainly quantitative (measurable) traits such as height, weight, IQ etc. and show a normal (Gaussian) distribution in the population. Lamarck, who in the 19th century claimed that acquired traits can be inherited, has taken a little revenge in recent years. Some examples have been found of how nutritional factors can condition DNA and affect future generations. As our understanding of the human genome increases, it has become increasingly clear that our knowledge is at present largely insufficient to attempt to explain all the phenotypic variability observed between individuals affected by the same disease. It is only gradually that we will unravel all the genetic and environmental factors responsible for this variability. Nevertheless, many families can already be helped by genetic testing in order to identify with precision what the nature of the disease is and what the recurrence risks are. Even fairly precise prediction of the risk to develop a disease in adult life (presymptomatic diagnosis) or of the susceptibility to develop serious multifactorial diseases, such as hereditary breast or colorectal cancer, is available. Nevertheless we have to guarantee our clients that these tests are done with the best quality available and in the context of appropriate genetic counseling.Genes and Environmental Influence in Asthma and AtopyR NickelDepartment of Pediatric Pneumology and Immunology, Charité, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsDespite a strong genetic basis for asthma and atopy, no genetic marker(s) unambiguously associated with atopy-related traits has yet been identified. Variants in &gt; 100 candidate genes were associated with atopy-related traits. However, replication (at least twice) was reported for less than 30 genes. Discrepant results may partly be attributed type 1 and type 2 errors due to small sample sizes or no correction for multiple tests. Also, different ethnicities of study populations have to be considered. There is growing evidence that gene-by-gene- and gene-byenvironment interactions strongly influence disease susceptibility and that single variant association studies are not sufficient to identify the genetic basis for atopic disorders. With regard to the development of asthma and atopy, environmental factors (e.g. factors associated with living on a farm, allergen exposure, infections) appear to be particularly important very early in life.MethodsTherefore, many gene-by-environment-interaction studies have been performed in pediatric populations and birth cohorts.Clinical Implications of Systems Biology and High-Throughput Technology in PediatricsM BensonDepartment of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, SwedenBackground and AimsComplex diseases like diabetes, allergy and cancer depend on multiple interacting genes. It is probably not possible to find a key gene in such diseases, a “silver bullet“ that can be used for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. New technologies, like DNA microarrays allow simultaneous analysis of expression of all human genes. We have applied these technologies and systems biology to allergic rhinitis. The clinical aim is to identify markers for treatment response. It is possible that similar principles are generally applicable to complex diseases.MethodsDNA microarrays, clique-based graph algorithms, pathway analysis, real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, SNP analysisWriting for Success: Or Everything I Wanted to Know About Getting Published but was Afraid to Ask!J W AlbarranUniversity of the West of England, Bristol, UKBackground and AimsNurses, whether as academics or practitioners are increasingly required to disseminate the findings of research or share ideas and examples of best practice through publication. Lack of confidence, time and familiarity with different journal house-styles are often cited as barriers. These issues will be considered. Moreover, writing informatively and in an accessible format is not easy, but it can be learned through following certain principles, commitment, time and enthusiasm [1–2]. Aim: The purpose of this workshop is for delegates to understand how to develop a successful strategy that will lead to publication in a peer-reviewed journal.MethodsThe workshop will address the following areas:Choosing a topic areaDecisions about choosing journal (impact factors and dissemination)Preparing the manuscript (conventions for research and non-research papers)Multiple publications from research projectsAuthorship and co-authorshipDealing with reviewers commentsThe Role of a Hospital Play Specialist in Ensuring the Development of Long-Term Ventilated Children on an Intensive Care UnitL Bassett, C M PiercePaediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsPlay therapy has been part of the intensive care service in our hospital since 1996. Hospital Play Specialists (HPS) work as part of the multidisciplinary and psychosocial team within the intensive care unit. We reviewed our experience of play therapy in long-term patients whilst on intensive care.MethodsWe performed a review of long-term ventilated patients on our intensive care unit, between 2002-2006 in which we routinely devised ‘play programmes’. The average stay was 12 months. Reason for contact and outcome were reviewed.Does Humour Delivered Through Clowning Benefit Children in Hospital? The Perceptions of the Theodora Children's Trust Special ClownsE A Glasper1,2, G Prudhoe11University of Southampton, 2Southampton University Hospitals Trust, Southampton, UKBackground and AimsThe use of humour as a therapy is receiving increasing attention from health care professionals. This study discusses the views of The English Theodora Children's Trust Clown Doctors of what works best and least well during a clown encounter with a sick child in hospital.MethodsNominal group technique (NGT). Sample size = 12.Cystic Fibrosis and Genes: A Brief History, but a Lot of NewsS CunninghamDepartment of Respiratory and Sleep Medicine, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, UKCystic Fibrosis, first described in 1938, was quickly recognised, like so many other conditions as being of autosomal recessive inheritance. There was understandable great excitement surrounding the discovery in 1989 of DeltaF508, the most common gene mutation for cystic fibrosis. As a recessive single gene defect disease the possibility of replacing the defective gene was a stimulating prospect. Seventeen years later, whilst other single gene defects have been corrected, a solution to the cystic fibrosis gene defect remains unresolved. The reasons for this lack of resolution are frustrating to patients and clinicians, but have opened novel and fruitful research directions. What can be so complex about this single gene defect? Firstly, there isn't just one gene defect, there are no more than 1000 genes identified associated with cystic fibrosis, falling into five functional classes. Secondly, we have become increasingly aware that the interplay of ancillary “modifier” genes play an important but as yet poorly quantified effect on the principle gene defect. Thirdly, as with other diseases, the complex evolving phenotype of cystic fibrosis, incorporates the interplay of genotype and environment, together with the possible role of epigenetics (heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence). Together these factors add a substantial complexity to what was considered a simple model of disease. Into this environment, the next generation of pulmonary trials for correction of the cystic fibrosis gene defect are now being planned. The first pulmonary trials were successful (in that gene transfer occurred), but not enough and side effects too many. Important lessons were learnt, and following a hiatus to reform the whole infrastructure of the gene delivery systems further trials are now planned. There are expected additional problems in children, not least of which is how will we know if gene transfer works. Yet children are considered the linchpin to the success of such studies (repairing the defect before major pulmonary injury has occurred) and research is underway to ensure that children should not be disenfranchised from this major biotechnological advance.Betamethasone Effects on Perinatal Pulmonary Development in an Escherichia Coli Experimental Model of Intra Uterine Infection in the RabbitN Joram1,3, E Launay1,3, J C Roze3, M L Franco-Montoya2, J Bourbon2, C Gras-Le Guen1,31Laboratoire d'Antibiologie, CHU Nantes, France2Laboratoire INSERM U651, Créteil, France3Departement de Perinatologie, CHU Nantes, FranceBackground and AimsChorioamnionitis is known to play a central role in its pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In clinical practice, glucocorticoids are used before a premature birth for their role in pulmonary maturation, decreasing the risk of morbidity and mortality. However, some animal studies suggest that they may also have adverse effects on alveolar development. In this context, we hypothesized that glucorticoids could major alveolarization impairment caused by chorioamnionitis.MethodsWe used a model of Escherichia coli chorioamnionitis in rabbits. Pregnant females (n=20) receiving an intrauterine inoculation with 103 E. Coli on day 25 of gestation received antibiotics and either one or two doses of betamethasone (0,1 mg/kg/dose) or saline serum, 6 hours after inoculation. Surviving foetuses were studied at first day after normal delivery. Alveolar development was compared between the three groups performing morphometric analysis (n=31). Inflammatory process was analyzed measuring cellularity in amniotic fluid and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.Structural Lung Abnormalities in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (Bpd): a New Scoring System for Lung-Ct Scan EvaluationJ E H Bunt1, V Casotti2, L Rubin3, R Failo3, M H Lequin4, W Hop5, H A Tiddens61Department of Paediatrics-Neonatology, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Paediatrics, Policlinico G.B.

Rossi, Verona, Italy, 4Department of Radiology, Erasmus MCSophia, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 5Department of Biostatistics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 6Department of Paediatrics-Pulmonology, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsLittle is known about the structural substrate causing pulmonary abnormalities in patients with BPD. Aims: First: To develop a scoring system to standardize the description of lung-CT scans in BPD. Second: To study long term structural changes on CT scans in BPD in relation to lung function and neonatal risk factors.MethodsRetrospective analysis of lung-CT scans in BPD. Patients received a lung-CT scan when indicated by the paediatric pulmonologist. CT scans were scored for: decreased density/hypovascularity (0–3 points); linear opacities (0–3 points); bullae (0–3 points); air trapping (0–1 point); consolidations (0–3 points); bronchiectasis (0–1 point), and airway wall thickening (0–1 point). The maximum score could be 85 (=100%). Three independent readers scored all scans to determine the reproducibility.Impact of Asthma on Children's Physical Activity, Emotional Wellbeing and Risk of ObesityC Glazebrook1, A McPherson2, C Ramsay1, R Newbould1, I MacDonald3, A Smyth41School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK, 2School of Nursing, University of Nottingham, UK, 3School of Biomedical Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK, 4Division of Child Health, University of Nottingham, UKBackground and AimsExercise is a frequently cited trigger for asthma symptoms in childhood. Any barrier to physical activity has implications for weight management and emotional wellbeing. This study aims to investigate the impact of asthma on children's customary activity, body mass index (BMI) and mental health.MethodsA controlled, cross-sectional study of children aged 7–4 attending hospital outpatient clinics, either for asthma (n=56), or for ENT or dermatological conditions (n=61). Measures were BMI and International Task Force classification of obesity. Parent-rated Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) assessed children's mental health and child-rated Physical Activity Questionnaire (PAQ) assessed total sedentary and physical activities in previous 24 hours.Effects of Indomethacin and Ibuprofen on Endothelins in the Developing Rat LungH D Modanlou1, K D Beharry1, J Hasan1,2, J V Aranda31Department of Pediatrics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, 2Department of Pediatrics, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach, CA, USA 3Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit Network, Children's Hospital of Michigan, Detroit, MI, USABackground and AimsIndomethacin (IN) is used for PDA closure, but its use is associated with changes in pulmonary vascular tone. These effects may be due to endothelin-1 (ET-1). We compared the effects of early postnatal IN and ibuprofen (IB) on ET-1 and big ET-1 levels in the rat lungs.MethodsNewborn rats (n=15/group) received IP injections at birth (P1), P2, and P3 of either saline (Sal); 0.2 mg/kg IN on P1 followed by 0.1 mg/kg on P2 and P3; 1.0 mg/kg IN on P1 followed by 0.5 mg/kg on P2 and P3; 10 mg/kg IB on P1 followed by 5 mg/kg on P2 and P3; and 50 mg/kg IB on P1 followed by 25 mg/kg on P2 and P3. At birth, P14 and P21, lung ET-1 and big ET-1 levels were examined.Laser CO2 Aryepiglottoplasty in Infants with Severe Laryngomalacia: Effects on Breathing PatternA Dotta1, S Bottero2, F Calzolari1, S Palamides1, C Corchia1, M Orzalesi11Department of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy2Otorinolaryngoiatry Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsLaryngomalacia is the most common cause of stridor in infants. Current treatment in severe forms is aryepiglottoplasty. Little is known about its effects on respiratory function. The aim was to evaluate changes in breathing pattern after aryepiglottoplasty in infants with severe laryngomalacia.MethodsTwenty infants were studied before and 4-6 weeks after laser CO2 aryepiglottoplasty. Laryngomalacia was diagnosed clinically and by laryngo-tracheal endoscopy. Breathing pattern was studied with an ultrasonic flow-meter measuring: Tidal Volume (Vt), Respiratory Rate (RR), Time to peak expiratory flow/expiratory time ratio (tPTEF/Te, an index of lower airways patency), Mean Expiratory/Mean Inspiratory Flow ratio (MEF/MIF, an index of upper airways patency). The patients underwent laser CO2 ariepiglottoplasty and following the procedure were kept intubated for 24 hrs. The comparison between pre (T1) and post aryepiglottoplasty (T2) test was done by the Student's t-test for paired values.Serum Levels of Seven Cytokines in Preterm Ventilated Newborns: Correlation with Old and New Forms of Bronchopulmonary-DysplasiaM Tana1, S Boccacci1, V Vendettuoli1, G Giuratrabocchetta1, A De Cunto1, C Tirone1, E Capoluongo2, C Santonocito2, F Vendittelli2, P Concolino2, M P De Carolis1, G Vento1, F Ameglio2, C Romagnoli11Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Catholic University of The Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy2Department of Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Catholic University of The Sacred Heart, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsBesides old classification of Chronic Lung Disease (CLD) — O2-dependency at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age-, recently a new definition for CLD has been proposed: New Bronchopulmonary-Dysplasia (BPD), which uses total duration of O2 supplementation and positive pressure requirements to delineate three degrees of severity: mild, moderate and severe, according to the respiratory status at 36 weeks post-menstrual age. Objective of this report is to analyse the balance of serum pro-inflammatory and profibrotic/angiogenic cytokine concentrations in relation to CLD or New BPD definition.MethodsThirty-one preterm neonates with a gestational age of 24 to 29 weeks, previously enrolled in a randomized clinical trial to compare the effects of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation versus intermittent mandatory ventilation in terms of pulmonary mechanics and lung cytokines, were actually studied to evaluate their serum cytokine concentration. At days 1, 3 and 5 after birth, serum samples were collected until extubation to detect the levels of three pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1) plus four profibrotic/angiogenic cytokines (IL-10, TGF-β1, VEGF, PDGF-BB), and correlation was made with old CLD or New BPD development.TNF-Alpha-308 and TGF-beta1-800 Polymorphisms and Risk of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Preterm NewbornsA De Cunto1, S Boccacci1, V Vendettuoli1, G Giuratrabocchetta1, M Tana1, C Tirone1, E Capoluongo2, C Santonocito2, P Concolino2, F Vendittelli2, M P De Carolis1, G Vento1, C Romagnoli11Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Università Cattolica S. Cuore, Rome, Italy2Departments of Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Università Cattolica S. Cuore, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsTNF-alpha −308 (G/A) has been associated with increased levels of TNF-alpha, involved in the BPD development. TGF-beta1-800 (G/A) is in linkage disequilibrium with TGF-beta1-509, associated with increased production of TGF-beta1, a marker of fibrotic response in BPD.MethodsPCR analyses were performed with DNA extracted from whole blood samples on 55 newborns with GA &lt;32 wks. 27 newborns with BPD (GA=26.7+/- 1.8wks; BW=821+/-223g) and 28 controls (GA=29.5+/- 1.7wks; BW=1274+/-358g p&lt;0.0001) were studied.The Alpha-Defensins in BALF of Preterm Infants Studied with Proteomic ApproachS Boccacci1, V Vendettuoli1, M Tana1, A De Cunto1, G Giuratrabocchetta1, C Tirone1, E Capoluongo2, R Inzitari2, M Castagnola2, M P De Carolis1, G Vento1, C Romagnoli11Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy2Department of Biochemistry and Clinical Biochemistry, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsThere is no evidence about the production of neutrophilic alpha-defensins (HNP 1–4) in preterms BALF and their role as anti-inflammatory markers.MethodsWe collected 31 BALF samples in 2nd and 3rd day of life from 21 ventilated neonates with RDS and GA &lt;35 weeks. In 10 patients a second sample was collected in 5th or 7th day. The mass spectrometry ESIION TRAP plus HPLC have been used for qualitative and semiquantitative analysis (Massa Area with EIC) of the alpha-defensins.Research in Medicines for Children: The New Regulation and the Role of the EMEAD BrasseurUniversity Children's Hospital Queen Fabiola, Brussels, Belgium and Chair of CHMP/Paediatric Expert Group at the European Medicines Agency (EMEA), London, UKThe European Union has since June 2006 a Regulation on ‘Better Medicines for Children’. Currently the provisions of the text await final implementation: the new system should be operational in Q2 of 2007 at the latest. The purposes are to facilitate and increase the development of medicines for children, promote a high quality of research, consolidate the ethical approach of clinical trials. The system hits inevitably new products at first submission or if claiming a new indication, a new route of administration, a new dosage or a new pharmaceutical form. The system is optional for unpatented drugs. Those still patented get a 6 months extension of their protection, the others a 10 years paediatric registration if they comply with the paediatric investigational plan (PIP). The PIP intents to assure availability of data and an age appropriate formulation. PIP means a research and development programme intended to obtain a paediatric indication. PIP will specify the timing and measures proposed to assess the quality, safety and efficacy in all subsets of the paediatric populations possibly concerned. The scope of the PIP includes the formulation(s), the preclinical safety, the clinical efficacy, the pharmaco-vigilance and any appropriate risk management plan. The timing of the PIP should be precised. In specific circumstances a PIP will be waived (likelihood of inefficacy, safety concerns, conditions occurring in adults only, or some ages groups might be waived [neonates…]). The PIP will be assessed by a Paediatric Committee (PECO) where each member state will be represented, as will be healthcare professionals and patients/parents (groups). The PECO will assess the proposed PIP and an agreement (or deferral/waiver) should be reached before the submission of the adult (part of the) dossier. If no discussion of PECO is included in a new application, the adult dossier cannot be validated. The PECO will also define compliance criteria that the company should fulfil before it can be decided that the requirements of the PIP have been met. This compliance will condition the 6 months extension, whatever the final results of the studies conducted. A failed PIP can thus lead to the incentives, provided this ‘negative’ information is incorporated in the product information. In order to facilitate the conduct of the PIP the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has set a number of measures: guidance on quality assessments of paediatric formulations, guidance on preclinical toxicity studies in juvenile animals, proposals on PK-PD studies and some reflection on the paediatric specificity of pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation.A Blinded Randomized Clinical Trial of Clonidine in Combination with Diluted Tincture of Opium (DTO) Versus DTO Alone for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)A G Agthe1,2, K B Mathias3, C W Hendrix2, L Jansson2,4, M Yaster2, T R Roark2, E B Gauda2,3,41University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA, 2Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, Baltimore, MD, USA, 3Mt. Washington Pediatric Hospital, Baltimore, MD, USA 4Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USABackground and AimsOpioids are the current standard for treating moderate and severe NAS. Clonidine is used widely as a non-opioid alternative for managing opioid withdrawal in adults. To determine whether clonidine in combination with tapering doses of DTO will significantly reduce the length of therapy and the amount of opioids used in infants with NAS.Methods80 Infants with history of maternal methadone or heroin use during pregnancy, having 2 consecutive modified Finnegan Scores (MFS) ≥9 were randomized to receive clonidine (Duraclon, 1 mcg/kg q4h) or placebo. Excluded infants were &lt;35 weeks gestational age, &lt;5th% birthweight, breastfeeding. DTO dose was increased in 6 steps from 0.2ml q4h up to 0.9ml q3h if 2 consecutive MFS ≥9. Infants with 2 consecutive MFS ≥9 on 0.9ml q3h were classified as treatment failure. Infants were monitored for hypotension, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturations.Electron Microscopy Findings of Renal Glomeruli and Tubules in Rat Pups Treated with Indomethacin and IbuprofenA Kent1,5, L Maxwell2, M Koina2, M C Falk3,5, D Willenborg4,5, J E Dahlstrom2,51Dept of Neonatology, The Canberra Hospital, {sr2}Dept of Anatomical Pathology, 3Dept of Renal Medicine, The Canberra Hospital, Woden, 4Neurosciences Research Unit, Australian National University, 5Dept of Paediatrics, Australian National University Medical School, Canberra, AustraliaBackground and AimsIndomethacin and ibuprofen are drugs that are commonly used to treat a patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. These drugs are known to cause acute renal failure in up to 25% of infants treated. Infants are usually treated between 24–28 weeks gestation at a time when glomerulogenesis is still occurring. To determine whether there are renal glomerular and tubular changes found on electron microscopy (EM) following administration of indomethacin and ibuprofen to rat pups.MethodsRat pups were administered indomethacin 0.1mg/kg or 0.2 mg/kg or ibuprofen 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally for 5 days from day 1 of life (equivalent to 24–26 weeks gestation in the human). Control groups consisted of no drug administration and normal saline administered intraperitoneally. The pups were sacrificed using carbon dioxide at 14 days of age, equivalent to term in the human. The systemic circulation was perfused with heparinized saline, papaverine, normal saline and fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 mol/L phosphate buffer. Three sections were taken for EM examination.Adenosine for the Management of Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension of the Newborn?T R Thiruchelvam, A J Petros, C M PiercePaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsPersistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) causes significant morbidity and mortality. Nitric oxide (iNO) reduces the need for ECMO in these infants. Adenosine is a potent pulmonary vasodilator that has also been used in PPHN. We reviewed our experience of adenosine in this population.MethodsRetrospective review of case notes of neonates admitted to our intensive care between Jan 2001 – Jan 2006 with clinical and echocardiographic evidence of PPHN. Clinical demographics and therapy were recorded.Use and Misuse of Corticosteroids in the Pediatric Intensive Care UnitD Mul, J J Verhoeven, K F M JoostenDepartment of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsCorticosteroid (CS) treatment is used for several indications in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). However, consensus on which CS to use and/or its dose is frequently lacking. Given the well known side-effects of CS on several metabolic and endocrine pathways careful use of CS should be considered.MethodsRetrospective analysis of the use of CS in our PICU during a random 11-months period in 2005. Indications, type of CS and dosing values were collected.Good Clinical Outcome after Acute Poisonings in Children, a Two-Year Prospective StudyT Rajka1, F Heyerdahl2, K E Hovda2, B Stiksrud3, D Jacobsen21Department of Paediatric Intensive Care, Ullevaal University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 2Department of Acute Medicine, Ullevaal University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 3Oslo Walk-In Casualty Center, Oslo, NorwayBackground and AimsThe incidence and types of acute poisonings in children changes over time. This study was designed to evaluate the clinical course and outcome of poisonings among children in Oslo, and findings were compared to a similar study from 1980.MethodsProspective observational study including all children &lt;16 years of age with a main diagnosis of acute poisoning admitted to hospital or the Central outpatient clinic in Oslo during two years.Oral Versus Intranasal Midazolam Premedication for Infants During Echocardiographic StudyS V Yildirim1, B E Guc2, N Bozdogan3, E Cekilmez2, T Cemil2, K Tokel41Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Baskent University, Adana Teaching and Medical Research Center, Adana, Turkey, 2Department of Pediatrics, Baskent University, Adana Teaching and Medical Research Center, Adana, Turkey, 3Department of Anaesthesiology, Baskent University, Adana Teaching and Medical Research Center, Adana, Turkey 4Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Baskent University, Faculty of Medicine, Adana, TurkeyBackground and AimsMovement and anxiety during echocardiographic study may reduce the reliability and compromise the quality of echocardiographic images; sedation is essential component for the procedure especially in infants. Purpose of this study: To evaluate the acceptance and effectiveness of intranasal vs. oral midazolam for infants during the transtorasic echocardiography.MethodsA randomized, prospective blinded placebo controlled study. Seventy-four infants, between the ages of 6 months to 3 years, presenting for elective echocardiographic study were divided 3 groups. Oral midazolam group (group 1) received 0.4 mg-kg-1 of injectable midazolam mixed with an equal volume of strawberry fruit, Intranasal midazolam group (group 2) received 0.2 mg-kg-1, and placebo group (group 3) received oral strawberry fruit or intranasal serum physiologic. A blinded echocardiographer assessed the sedation and echocardiographer's satisfaction scores for each child, and score for the easiness of administration was recorded by the nurse.Does Maternal Allopurinol (ALLO) Administration During Perinatal Hypoxic-Ischemia (P-HI) Transfer the Placenta in Sheep and Humans?M J N L Benders1, H L Torrance1, J B Derks1, M Oudijk1, C M Rademaker2, F Groenendaal1, D A Giussani3, G H Visser1, F van Bel11Department of Perinatology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pharmacy, University Medical Center Utrecht, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands 3Department of Physiology, University of Cambridge, UKBackground and AimsALLO inhibits xanthine oxidase (XO) and thereby prevents formation of toxic superoxide-radicals during P-HI and early reperfusion. Postnatal ALLO does not seem neuroprotective, probably because treatment is started too late to prevent the XO-surge. Antenatal ALLO-administration to mothers during P-HI may provide neuroprotection. This study evaluated placental passage after ALLO-administration to mothers during P-HI through measurement of ALLO and oxypurinol (OXY) concentrations in mothers and hypoxic fetuses. In a previous study therapeutic levels (&gt;4mg/L) were reached in newborns after oral ALLO-administration of 600mg to women in uncomplicated labour (Boda 1999).MethodsPregnant ewes at 0.8 of gestation received a single IV ALLO-dose of 900mg during intermittent umbilical cord clamping. Women in labour with GA&gt;36wks and signs of fetal distress received a single ALLO-dose of 500mg IV or 600mg orally. ALLO and OXY concentrations were measured in maternal and umbilical cord (UC) blood.Effect of Propofol on Seizure Like Phenomena and EEG Activity in Children with Epilepsy Vs. Mental RetardationL Gortner1,2, S Meyer1, M G Shamdeen2, B Kegel2, T Mencke3, S Gottschling2, U Grundmann31Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital of Saarland, Homburg, Germany, 2Section of Neuropediatrics, University Hospital of Saarland, Homburg, Germany, 3Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital of Saarland, Homburg, GermanyBackground and AimsPropofol (PROP) is widely used for sedation in children. Until today, there is an ongoing debate whether PROP exhibits pro- or anticonvulsant effects, and whether it should be used in patients with epilepsy. This prospective study was done to assess seizure like phenomena (SLP) and EEG changes in children with epilepsy receiving PROP sedation for MRI studies, and to compare these data to non-epileptic children.MethodsWe prospectively assessed the occurrence of SLP and the effects of PROP on the EEG in 25 children with epilepsy and 25 children with mental retardation undergoing sedation for MRI studies.Concepts of Cardiac DevelopmentA F M Moorman, V M ChristoffelsDepartment of Anatomy and Embryology, Academic Medical Centre, University of Amsterdam, The NetherlandsIn this presentation we discuss the formation of the synchronously contracting chambered heart from a peristaltically contracting linear heart tube. It is proposed that members of the T-box family of transcription factors play a crucial role in the formation of the building plan of the heart. Tbx5 confers craniocaudal polarity to the heart tube, whereas Tbx2 and Tbx3 prevent the cardiac inflow tract, atrioventricular region, outflow tract, as well as the cardiac inner curvatures from chamber differentiation. With the exception of the outflow tract that becomes incorporated into the ventricles, these regions contribute to the cardiac conduction system. Tbx1 specifically is involved in the formation of the outflow tract, whereas Tbx18 is involved in the formation of the systemic venous tributaries. One of the most fascinating aspects in the formation of the heart is the very early development of the electrical patterning as can be registered by the ECG, which is the registration of the rhythmic waves of depolarising activity over the cardiac muscle. In the mature heart the conduction system is responsible for the rhythmic excitations and contractions. However, in chicken embryos a sinusoidal type of ECG can already be derived from the linear heart tube stages at about two days of development, and less than one day later when chamber formation has just been initiated, an adult type of ECG can be monitored. The question can thus justifiably be asked whether the presence of an adult type of ECG in these early embryonic hearts implies the presence of a conduction system. Generally, the conduction system is defined as the system of specialized myocardial tissues responsible for initiation and propagation of the sinus impulse. If we accept this functional definition, then the early embryonic heart has a conduction system, which is already in place, because there is an adult type of ECG. On the other hand, if we would apply strict anatomical and histological definitions, the embryonic heart undeniably lacks a conduction system. This field of tension concerning the recognition of the conduction system using physiological versus anatomical / histological criteria has led to many controversies in the field.. In this contribution we discuss the specification of the embryonic areas that will become chamber and those areas that will not form chambers and participate in the formation of the distinct components of the conduction system. Another intriguing aspect is how during evolution the cardiac components of the pulmonary circulation evolved. Recently, a novel cardiac field, the so-called secondary heart-forming field, has been described. This field is localized centrally from the classic cardiac crescent on the embryonic disc. We discuss the view that the so-called second heart-forming field contributes to the cardiac components of the evolutionary new pulmonary circulation, being the right ventricle and outflow tract as well as the mediastinal myocardium, which gives rise to the atrial septum and the dorsal wall of the left atrium. Both types of myocardium are derived from the mesenchyme that is localized centrally from the classic cardiac crescent.Cardiac Output Measurement Using a Modified Carbon Dioxide Fick Method: A Validation Study in Ventilated LambsW P de Boode1, J G van der Hoeven2, O Daniës3, J C W Hopman4, K D Liem11Department of Neonatology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands2Department of Intensive Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands 3Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 4Department of Clinical Physics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsCardiac output can be measured using a modified carbon dioxide Fick (mCO2- F) method. We performed a validation study comparing mCO2-F method derived cardiac output (QmCO2F) with measured pulmonary blood flow by an ultrasonic flowprobe (Qufp).MethodsThe study was approved by the Ethical Committee on Animal Research and performed in 7 random-bred newborn lambs (2.9 – 6.4 kg). The mCO2-F method is based on the principle, that in a steady state carbon dioxide production equals pulmonary carbon dioxide exchange. Cardiac output was manipulated by creating hemorrhagic hypotension. Bias, defined as QmCO2F minus Qufp, was calculated for each measurement. For every venous sampling site mean bias with standard deviation (sd), 95% confidence intervals and limits of agreement (LOA) were calculated. LOA are defined as mean bias ± 1.96 sd.The Use of Pro B-Type Natriuretic Peptide as a Measure of Left Ventricular Function in Preterm NeonatesA F El-Khuffash1, M Ambruso2, M Culliton2, J Loyta3, K Walsh4, E J Molloy11Department of Neonatology, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, 2Department of Biochemistry, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland 3Department of Biostatistics, University College Dublin, Ireland, 4Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and Pro brain natriuretic peptide (Pro-BNP) are useful markers of left ventricular function in adults and are widely used to diagnose cardiac failure. Their use is yet to be explored in neonates. Adequate left ventricular function is vital to maintain sufficient systemic perfusion in adults and possibly in preterm neonates. We hypothesize that Pro-BNP can be a useful marker of left ventricular function in neonates.MethodsPreterm neonates less than 1500g and less than 30 weeks were enrolled in the prospective blinded study. Echocardiographic measurement of Stroke volume (SV) and left ventricular output (LVO) were carried out on days 1, 3, and five of life. Pro-BNP levels were measured at the same time as echo measurement.Transpulmonary Thermodilution Cardiac Output Measurement Versus Ultrasound Flowprobe in a Newborn Lamb ModelJ Lemson1, W P de Boode2, J G van der Hoeven11Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 2Department of Neonatology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsCardiac output (CO) measurement in critically ill children is cumbersome, but may improve haemodynamic management. Transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) technique has been used but validation in small children is limited. This is the first study to compare TPTD with ultrasound flow probes in a paediatric animal model.MethodsWe prospectively studied 9 mechanically ventilated and sedated lambs with a median weight of 6.5 kg (4.7 – 12.5 kg) under various circulatory conditions. TPTD measurements were performed with ice-cold saline using the PiCCOplus system (Pulsion Medical Systems). The mean of 4 consecutive measurements with a normal TPTD curve were compared to a simultaneous registration of an ultrasound perivascular flowprobe around the pulmonary artery (Transonic Systems Inc.).Fetal Growth Characteristics and Left Cardiac Structure in Early Infancy. the Generation R StudyJ J M Geelhoed1,2, V W V Jaddoe1,2,3, L M Van Osch-Gevers3, A Hofman2, W A Helbing3, J C M Witteman21The Generation R Study Group, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 3Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsLeft ventricular hypertrophy may be partly originated in early life. The aim of this study was to examine the associations of fetal growth characteristics in the second and third trimester of pregnancy and at birth with left cardiac structure in early infancy.MethodsThis study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a prospective population-based cohort study from fetal life until adulthood. Fetal growth characteristics were assessed by ultrasounds in each trimester in pregnant women. Echocardiographic follow-up studies were performed in a subgroup of 791 infants aged 6 weeks and 6 months.Lung Antioxidant Enzymes are Regulated by Increased Pulmonary Blood Flow in the Neonatal LambS M Black1, A Grobe2, P Oishi3, A Azakie4, J R Fineman31Vascular Biology Center, The Medical College of Georgia, Augusta, GA, USA, 2Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Montana, Missoula, MT, USA, 3Department of Pediatrics, UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA, 4Department of Surgery, UC San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USABackground and AimsOur previous studies have indicated that an increase in oxidative stress is involved in the development of pulmonary hypertension in a lamb model of increased pulmonary blood flow (Shunts). However, it is not clear whether this is due, at least in part, to alterations in lung antioxidant enzymes. Thus, the goal of this study was to determine whether the expression and activity of lung antioxidant enzymes are altered during the development of pulmonary hypertension in Shunt lambs.MethodsEighteen fetal lambs underwent in utero placement of an aortopulmonary vascular graft. Two-, four, and eight- weeks following spontaneous delivery, peripheral lung tissue was collected. Expression of catalase, SODI and SOD2 were evaluated by Western blotting. Catalase and SOD activities were also determined. A P &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.Optimal Settings During TVI Recording and off Line Strain and Strain-Rate Analysis in Term NeonatesE Nestaas1,2, A Stølen3,4, L Sandvik5, L Brunvand1, D Fugelseth11Department of Paediatrics, Ullevå University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 2Department of Paediatrics, Hospital of Vestfold, Tøsberg, Norway, 3Department of Cardiology, St. Olavs Hospital, Trondheim, Norway 4Department of Circulation and Medical Imaging, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, 5Centre for Clinical Research, Ullevå University Hospital, Oslo, NorwayBackground and AimsStrain and strain-rate (SR) measurements from tissue velocity images (TVI) are noisy. A novel method for noise estimation, based on the measured variation between two consecutive heart beats, was used for assessing the optimal settings during TVI recording and deformation analysis in term neonates.MethodsThe strain and SR beat to beat variation (BBV) were assessed in 8 good-quality TVI for each of the following probe and frame rate (FR) settings (Vivid 7, GE Vingmed, range +/− 16 cm/sec); 5S probe default FR, 10S default FR and 10S low FR. Two segments per wall were analysed using 48 different combinations of region of interest (ROI) size and strain length (SL).Neonatal Respiratory ECMO in the UK: Where are We 10 Years after UK ECMO Trial?A Karimova1, J Cassidy2, C Davis3, H Pandya4, K Harrington1, W Beierlein1, A P Goldman11Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, 2Freeman Hospital, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, 3The Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK, 4Glenfield Hospital, Leicester, UKBackground and AimsAfter the UK neonatal ECMO trial (1993–1995), a national ECMO service was established (1996). ELSO reports worldwide decline in neonatal ECMO. This paper reviews neonatal respiratory ECMO in the UK focusing on last 10 years.MethodsRetrospective review: patient demographics; illness severity; ECMO indication, characteristics and outcome. Changing Demographics in Neonatal Extracorporeal Membran Oxygenation (ECMO) — New Results from the German ECMO Center mannheimF Loersch, S T Hien, S Demirakca, C H v. Buch, H Wirth, V Varnholt, T H SchaibleNICU, University Childrens Hospital, Mannheim, GermanyBackground and AimsECMO is a standard treatment in the algorithm of neonatal respiratory failure who can provide oxygenation and may reduce ventilator induced injury. Furthermore ECMO helps to avoid high doses of inotropic medications and may help to overcome pulmonary hypertension. Over the last 20 years marked changes have occurred by new technical developments and indications for neonatal ECMO therapy. We analysed the changes in our ECMO center over this time period.MethodsFrom 1987–2006, 281 neonates were treated with ECMO in Mannheim. From 1987–1991, 33 patients, from 1992–1996, 68 and from 1997–2001, 85 patients were treated with ECMO. In the last period from 2002–2006, 95 patients put on either VV or VAECMO.Bronchiolitis in Europe — A Comparative SurveyA SeizDepartment of Pediatric Emergency, University Hospital, Saint Etienne, FranceBackground and AimsBronchiolitis is a common cause of illness and an increasingly important cause of hospitalisation. It remains a major concern for paediatricians and typically affects infants younger than two years, principally during winter months. Bronchiolitis is a self-limited illness in most previously healthy infants and resolves frequently without complications. However, severely affected infants are at increased risk for complications. Assessment of disease severity is very important in the management of bronchiolitis. Neither for assessment of severity nor for hospitalisation nor for treatment recommendations are official criteria in place. Although there is a lack of well established criteria a number of guidelines have been published.MethodsIn this comparative survey appropriate guidelines were taken from the European French and German speaking paediatric scholarly societies (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland). These guidelines were evaluated to address the issue of consistency with evidence from large randomised trials, meta-analyses, and systematic reviews.Pentavalent (Human-Bovine) Reassortant Rotavirus Vaccine (PRV) Reduced Hospitalizations and Emergency Department (ED) Visits for Rotavirus (RV) Acute Gastroenteritis (Age): Assessing the Robustness of the ResultsR Itzler1, T Vesikari2, D Matson3, M Coia1, J Cook1, G Davies1, M DiNubile1, P Heaton1, J Heyse1, G Koch41Merck Research Labs, West Point, PA, USA 2University of Tampere, Finland, 3Eastern Virginia Medical School, Norfolk, VA, USA, 4University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC, USABackground and AimsBetween 2001–2004, 70,301 healthy infants 6–12 weeks old were enrolled from 11 countries in the Rotavirus Efficacy and Safety Trial (REST) to receive 3 oral doses of PRV expressing human serotypes G1-4 and P[8] or placebo. Active surveillance for hospitalizations and ED visits for AGE was conducted 7, 14, and 42 days after each dose and every 6 weeks thereafter for up to two years. Three doses of PRV reduced the rate of G1-4 RV-associated hospitalizations/ED visits by 94.5% [95% CI: 91.2, 96.6] (N Engl J Med 2006; 354:23–33). We assessed the rate reductions in all subjects receiving ≥1 dose.MethodsThe case definition for RV AGE was vomiting and/or ≥3 loose stools within 24 hours and RV detection in stool by EIA. Serotypes were identified by PCR. Analyses were performed using Poisson regression.Results from the Reveal Study — Pediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis: Age Distribution and Seasonal Trends Among 2846 Children Presenting with Symptoms of Acute Gastroenteritis in Seven European CountriesF A Allaert9, C Giaquinto1, L Gothefors2, C Huelsse4, F Huet3, M Kulig{au10}, J Paricio5, M Tomas6, P Todd7, P Van Damme8, N Vernet9, M Watson101Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Italy, 2Barn-Och Ungdomskliniken, Norrlands Universitetssjukhus, Umeà, Sweden, 3Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Dijon, France 4Landesgesundheitsamt, Rostock, Germany 5Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Marina Alta, Denia, Spain, 6Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Francesc de Borja, Gandia, Spain, 7Arrowe Park Hospital, Wirral, UK, 8Center for the Evaluation of Vaccination, University of Antwerp, Belgium 9Department of Epidemiology, McGill University and Cenbiotech, Dijon, France, 10Sanofi Pasteur MSD, Lyon, FranceBackground and AimsPaediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis (PRG) affects the majority of children during the first years of life and causes a considerable medical and economic burden of disease (BOD). In order to quantify this BOD and the beneficial impact of preventative vaccination, further understanding of seasonal and age distribution of PRG is required.MethodsA prospective, observational, study was conducted in seven coutries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, United Kingdom). Children up to 5 years of age with physician-diagnosed acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were included. They were recruited from 12 hospitals, 16 emergency departments and 139 paediatricians (FP/GP) between Oct 2004 and Sept 2005. Rotavirus was determined by ELISA testing.hMPV Infections are Not Generally Milder Than RSV InfectionsO Schildgen1, A Wilkesmann2, A M Eis-Hübinger2, T Geikoswski2, T Glatzel2, M J Lentze1, U Bode1, A Simon11Childrens Hospital, Medical Center, University of Bonn, Germany, 2Institute for Medical Microbiology, Immunology and Parasitology, Department of Virology, University of Bonn, GermanyBackground and AimsHuman Metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a worldwide distributed pathogen in pediatric viral respiratory tract infection (VRTI). Earlier publications suggest milder illness severity in hMPV-compared to Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)-infection.Methods637 nasopharyngeal aspirates from pediatric patients were tested by hMPV-PCR in two consecutive seasons. Risk factors, clinical, and laboratory items were analyzed. The hMPV-infected patients were compared with hMPV-negative, RSV-infected patients by matched pair analysis.Post Neonatal Tetanus — Preventable But Still Prevalent Among Rural Population of IndiaP H Shah1, S M Nimbalkar1, S N Vani1, A A Kapoor1, A P Shah21Department of Paediatrics, Pramukhswami Medical College and Hospital, Karamsad, Gujarat, India 2Department of Microbiology, Government Medical College and New Civil Hospital, Surat, Gujarat, IndiaBackground and AimsTetanus is a neurological disorder with spasticity, muscle spasms and autonomic disturbances caused by neurotoxin ‘tetanospasmin’ produced by clostridium tetani. Tetanus was first described in Egypt over 3000 years ago and was prevalent throughout the ancient world. Very few reviews of tetanus in children are available in India and other countries. Our aim was to study the mode of infection, incubation period, period of onset, duration of spasms, complications, vaccination status and outcome.MethodsDiagnosis of tetanus was made on clinical grounds. Cases of tetanus between 1 month and 16 years of age admitted between August 1999 to December 2002 were evaluated retrospectively. Severity was graded on the basis of Patel and Joag criteria.Development of an Antiviral for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) Utilizing RNA Interference (RNAi)J P DeVincenzo1, R Alvarez2, R Tripp3, J Cehelsky2, P Hadwiger2, R Pandey2, P Ge2, R Constein2, S Elbashir2, M John2, S Shanmugan2, R Meyers21Department of Pediatrics, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA, 2Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA, USA, 3University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USABackground and AimsRSV is the leading cause of hospitalisation of infants and is an important pathogen of the elderly and the immunosuppressed. Existing preventions and treatments are limited. RNAi utilizes existing ubiquitous cellular proteins to catalyze targeted mRNA degradation in a sequence-specific manner. Aims: To evaluate small inhibiting RNAs (siRNA) as potential antivirals and to test their safety in humans.MethodsThe RSV genome was screened bioinformatically for consensus sequences across RSV strains while avoiding human homology by BLAST. Resulting siRNAs were screened invitro by plaque reduction. Promising candidates targeting RSV P, N and L mRNA were screened invivo using BALB/c mouse models utilizing mismatched siRNA controls. ALN-RSV01 (N target) was further evaluated by formal toxicology studies. Single and multiple rising doses of ALN-RSV01 nasal spray were evaluated in healthy adults in a double-blind, placebo-(saline)-controlled phase 1 trial.Effects of Initiation of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy on Haemodynamics in Critically ILL ChildrenJ Brierley, M Richardson, M PetersPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsThere are no studies analysing the haemodynamic effects of initiating continuous venovenous haemofiltration (CVVH) in critically ill children. Haemodynamic instability is often met by countering ‘filter-related decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR)’ with vasoconstrictors. Newer noninvasive haemodynamic techniques may allow more physiological management.MethodsProspective observational study of 9 critically ill children (1–9 years) to define haemodynamic responses to commencing CVVH. Heart rate (HR), mean blood pressure (MABP), central venous pressure (CVP), and central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2%) were directly measured at 15 minutely intervals for an hour together with cardiac index (CI), SVR index (SVRi), stroke volume index (SVi) by non-invasive continuous wave Doppler ultrasound device. (USCOM) No changes in inotrope or volume administration occurred during the study.Rapid Oral Rehydration Therapy in the Management of Childhood GastroenteritisC D Aarts-Tesselaar1, A A Vaessen-Verberne21Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus Medical Centre, Sophia's Childrens Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pediatrics, Amphia Hospital, Breda, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsDehydration due to gastroenteritis is a serious health problem in younger children and accounts for a substantial number of admissions at paediatric wards. Despite recent guidelines part of these children are rehydrated with intravenous fluids and hospitalisation stay is prolonged. Our objective is to evaluate whether rehydration with oral rehydration solution during a four-hour period in the hospital is safe and efficient in children with acute gastroenteritis. Primary outcome is the success rate, that is the percentage of children who are successfully rehydrated and sent home after rehydration. Secondary outcomes are duration of diarrhea and/or vomiting and reassessment at the emergency department or requirement of hospitalisation.MethodsA total of 102 patients (6 months – 6 years) admitted with dehydration due to acute gastroenteritis were enrolled in our study. Exclusion criteria included invagination, ileus, short bowel syndrome, volvulus, diabetes mellitus, HUS and underlying severe parenteral infection. Depending on the severity of dehydration, patients were rehydrated according to ESPGHAN guidelines with 50 to 100 ml/kg ORS over four hours, followed by continuation of the usual diet.Emotional/Behavioral Problems and Social and Academic Competence in VLBW AdolescentsL B Dahl2, P I Kaaresen1, J Tunby1, B H Handegård2, S Kvernmo2, J A Røning21Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø, Norway, 2Institute for Clinical Medicine, University of Tromsø, Tromsø, NorwayBackground and AimsEmotional and behavioral problems and reduced social and academic competence are common in VLBW survivors. Studies often conclude from parent-report (CBCL) alone. Youth self-report (YSR) is uncommon.MethodsOf 265 VLBW preterms born 1978 – 1989, 174 survived to adolescence (65.7%). Those 13 to 18 years were addressed. 156 families were eligible, 99 completed CBCL (63.5%), and 82 completed YSR (52.6%). CBCL and YSR provide problem and competence scores. Parents of VLBW adolescents were compared to parents of normative adolescents, VLBW adolescents were compared to normative adolescents, VLBW adolescents and their parents were compared in pairs. T-tests and Intraclass correlation were used.Neonatal Hydrocortisone Treatment: Neurodevelopmental Outcome and MRI at School Age in Preterm Born ChildrenK J Rademaker1, C S P M Uiterwaal2, F Groenendaal1, M M A T Uniken Venema3, F van Bel1, F J Beek4, I C van Haastert1, D E Grobbee2, L S De Vries11Department of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 3Department of Pediatric Psychology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The Netherlands, 4Department of Pediatric Radiology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsDexamethasone improves ventilatory status in BPD, but has a negative impact on long-term neurodevelopment. Another corticosteroid with fewer side effects would be welcomed: hydrocortisone may offer such alternative. We investigated neurodevelopment and presence of brain lesions at school age in preterm infants, who had been prescribed hydrocortisone for BPD.Methods226 preterm born children (≤32 weeks or birth weight ≤1500 grams) participated in a cohort study with 8 years follow-up. They performed five subtests of the WISC-R, the Visual Motor Integration (VMI) and a memory test. Motor function was assessed using the Movement ABC. Brain lesions were documented by MRI. Sixty-two children who received hydrocortisone for BPD (5 mg/kg tapered over a minimum period of 22 days, median duration 27.5 days) were compared with 164 controls.Functional Outcomes and Participation in Young Adulthood for Very Preterm and Very-Low-Birthweight Infants: The Dutch Pops-Study at 19 Years of AgeE T M Hille1,2, N Weisglas-Kuperus1, J B van Goudoever1, G W Jacobusse2, M H Ens-Dokkum3, L de Groot4, J M Wit5, W B Geven6, J H Kok7, M J K de Kleine8, L A A Kollée9, A L M Mulder10, H L M Van Straaten11, L S de Vries12, M M van Weissenbruch4, S P Verloove-Vanhorick2,51Department of Neonatology, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2Department of Prevention and Health, TNO Quality of Life, Leiden, The Netherlands, 3Royal Effatha Guyot Group, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands, 4Department of Neonatology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 5Department of Pediatrics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands 6Department of Neonatology, UMCG Beatrix Children's Hospital, Groningen, The Netherlands, 7Department of Neonatology, AMC Emma Children's Hospital, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 8Department of Pediatrics, Máxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, The Netherlands, 9Department of Pediatrics, UMC St Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 10Department of Neonatology, University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands, 11Department of Pediatrics/Neonatology, Isala Clinics, Zwolle, The Netherlands, 12Department of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsYoung adults born very preterm or with a very-low-birth-weight remain at risk for physical and neurodevelopmental problems and lower academic achievement scores. Data however are scarce, hospital-based, mostly done in small populations and need further confirmation.MethodsInfants born below 32 weeks of gestation and/or with a birth weight less than 1,500 gram in the Netherlands in 1983 (POPS study), were re-examined at age 19. Outcomes were adjusted for nonrespondents using multiple imputation and categorized into none, mild, moderate and severe problems.Motor Skills and Vision, Perception and Proprioception in Low Birth Weight AdolescentsK A I Evensen1, S Lindqvist1, S Kulseng2, M Indredavik3, A M Brubakk1, T Vik41Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, 2Department of Paediatrics, St. Olavs University Hospital, Trondheim, Norway, 3Department of Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, 4Department of Public Health and General Practice, Faculty of Medicine, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, NorwayBackground and AimsMotor problems have been frequently reported in low birth weight populations, and may be related to visual, perceptive or proprioceptive deficits. The aim of this study was to examine the association between motor skills and vision, perception and proprioception in adolescents with low birth weight without cerebral palsy (CP).MethodsFifty-one very low birth weight adolescents (VLBW: birth weight ≤1500g), 57 term small for gestational age (SGA: birth weight &lt;10th centile) and 77 term control adolescents (birth weight ≥10th centile) without CP were examined by the age of 14. We performed regression analyses with the total score of the Movement Assessement Battery for Children (Movement ABC) as the outcome variable and the Visuo-Motor Integration test (VMI), the Motor Coordination and Visual Perception supplementary tasks, tests of proprioceptive abilities, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, strabismus and stereopsis as independent variables.Sensorimotor Outcome at 2 Years in Extremely Preterm Infants.

To determine, 7 years after discharge, the maternal psychological consequences of an hospitalisation of a premature infant less than 32 GA.Methods66 mothers (mean age 30 years) corresponding to 82 infants (mean gestational age 30 +/− 2.5 weeks, mean birth weight 1435 +/− 417 grams) from the EPIPAGE cohort in Pays de Loire were eligible and answered a phone semi structured interview 7 years after discharge (mean neonatal hospitalisation stay 55 +/− 28 days). We analysed all answer taking neonatal characteristics and 5 years follow-up of infant into account.Moral Dilemmas in Ethical Decision Making for Nurses: Roles and ModelsJ E De Vos, A Van Den Hoogen Department of Neonatology, WKZ, UMC Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsNurses roles in ethical decision making and how nurses are defining an opinion in moral dilemmas is an issue in neonatology and pediatrics. Moral dilemmas arise in discussions on whether or not to start or to continue a treatment for infants in an intensive care unit.MethodsTwo qualitative studies were done. The results were analysed by the method of Maso (1994). Data generation took place by means of semi-structured interviews with nurses working in the NICU of the Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis (University Medical Centre in Utrecht) and by literature study. The moral model used was the so called ‘Model of Nijmegen’ for moral reasoning. The theories on justice and care perspective of Kohlberg, 1984 and Gilligan, 1985 make up the study's theoretical framework.Parental Presence During ResuscitationJ M LatourPICU, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThe current resuscitation guidelines are supportive to parental presence during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However, the subject remains a controversial issue. The aim is to determine the pros and cons of the healthcare professionals’ view of witnessed CPR, to discuss the parental empowerment and the impact on parents, and to assess the implication of the current CPR guidelines regarding parental presence during resuscitation.MethodsA literature search on parental presence during CPR was performed. Particular on the issues of the professionals’ views and attitudes, the impact on family and parents and the available position statements of organisations.Honesty With MercyD E KnightEvelina Children's Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsHonesty can be considered to exist along a continuum ranging from dishonesty to honesty. Every person has their own individual place on this continuum, dictated by their individual backgrounds and experiences. It is hoped to encourage bedside intensive-care nurses to identify where they are on this continuum and to actively participate in helping render patients and their families more “ready” for receiving and coping with bad news.MethodsThe dishonesty/honesty continuum is identified. With examples from the author's own nursing experiences, her movement along this continuum is illustrated giving rise to her current belief in honesty with mercy in nurse relationships with patients and their families. This illustration focuses on three aspects of honesty: truth-telling, timing and lying. Also, it highlights the unique position intensive-care nurses have at the bedside. They often have unique knowledge of the patients’ and families’ wishes to know information and the amounts that will be manageable by them. Similarly, often they can create, or be presented with, unique opportunities to help vulnerable patients and their families become receptive to disclosure of information.Challenging the Theoretical Basis of the Philosophy of ‘Partnership with Parents’I Coyne, J A ConlonSchool of Nursing, Dublin City University, IrelandBackground and AimsParent participation is a key issue in children's health care, both in Ireland and internationally. Although nurses are expected to enter into partnership with families in the provision of care, research on parental participation from the UK, Sweden, Australia and from the USA indicates that parental participation is a complex, multidimensional and problematic concept that nurses find difficult to understand and apply to practice. This research focuses on developing an understanding of parents and childrens experiences of consultation and involvement in care during periods of hospitalization.MethodsPrevious research in this area has been descriptive therefore a grounded theory approach was used to develop a theoretical perspective on parent participation in order to explain the underlying process. The data collected contributed to the theoretical framework which Dr. Imelda Coyne developed in her PhD, which enhanced the applicability and generalisability of the theory across many paediatric settings.Investigation of Children's Experiences of Involvement and Consultation in Their Health Care Within the Hospital Setting in IrelandI T Coyne, E Hayes, P GallagherSchool of Nursing, Dublin City University, IrelandBackground and AimsThe past decade has seen the importance of children's rights to participation and consultation established both nationally and internationally. Yet the evidence suggests that children's participation may be more rhetoric than reality. There is limited empirical data on hospitalised children's participation in consultations and decision-making in Ireland. Hence this paper reports on children's experiences of involvement and consultation in their health care in hospital. Ensuring that the views of children are taken into account in matters affecting them is consistent with the vision of the Irish National Children's Strategy, which is “an Ireland where children are respected as young citizens with a valued contribution to make, and a voice of their own” (2000, p4). Aims: (a) To describe children's experiences of consultation in the healthcare setting. (b) To identify the factors that enhance or hinder children's involvement in consultation and the decision making process. (c) To explore strategies that will facilitate children's participation in their own health care decisions.MethodsThe data were collected through focus groups, single interviews, and questionnaires. Data were obtained from children (n = 55) aged from 7 to 18 years from ten paediatric wards in three hospitals in Ireland.Dilemma, a Organisation Supporting Parents o Seriously ILL or Handicapped Children During the Process of Decision MakingN E C Visée1, M J K De Kleine1,21Dilemma Foundation, Utrecht, The Netherlands 2Department of Neonatology, Máxima Medical Centre, Veldhoven, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsEnd-of-life decisions precede death in two third of the deaths of children below one year of age and in an unknown percentage of children that do not die. Although many of these decisions are taken in good cooperation between parents and doctors, both the process of decision making and the decisions themselves can create an enormous burden for the parents. During the process of decision making, caregivers frequently disagree, leaving the parents in even greater distress. In the Netherlands, termination of life in newborns with hopeless and unbearable suffering is considered a criminal offence, even if it takes place on explicit request of the parents.MethodsDilemma is a foundation that supports parents that have questions about life and death of their seriously ill or handicapped child, either before or after birth. Support is provided in the broadest sense, varying from offering an opportunity to talk, to helping in finding professionals who can mediate or take over the existing treatment. Dilemma runs a telephone number, situated at the desk of the Dutch Paediatric Association. The foundation's backbone is a number of volunteers and a network of independent professional experts.Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: Impact of Prevenar in North AmericaJ D KellnerAlberta, CanadaPlease refer to page 119a.The Management of Febrile Children in the Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine EraD IsaacmanWyeth Pharmaceuticals, Collegeville, PA, USAThe heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevenar) has lead to a marked decrease in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease, and significant changes in the epidemiology of occult bacteremia. This talk will review the clinical implications of reductions in invasive pneumococcal disease as they affect the practicing clinician. Particular emphasis will be dedicated to the impact of reductions of pneumococcal bacteremia and meningitis on the management of fever without source in the child 3–36 months of age.Changes in the Epidemiology of Invasive Pneumococcal Disease in SpainF GimenezServicio de Pediatría, Hospital Torrecardenas, Almería, SpainObjectiveTo describe the global situation of pneumococcal disease and also the impact of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7vPn-CRM) in Spain 5y after its commercialization.MethodsWe describe status disease going through all Spanish data published and accessible. We have to take into account an important issue: IPD including meningitis is not a notifiable disease, therefore is difficult to obtain pre-commercialization data to compare with post-commercialization data. It is also important to note that nowadays vaccine coverage is unknown.Honorary Lecture: The Impact of Prenatal and Postnatal Steroids and Surfactant Replacement Therapy on the Outcome of Pre-Term InfantsE ShinwellProfessor of Neonatal Paediatrics, Department of Neonatology, Kaplan Medical Center, Rehovot and Hebrew University, Jerusalem, IsraelBackground and AimsBengt Robertson is a pioneer of research in lung disease of premature infants. His work has revolutionized the management and outcome of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD). In his honor, the ESPR established this year a Young Investigator's Award to stimulate future leaders in the field. This lecture will trace the development of the major interventions in the field — surfactant replacement and pre- and postnatal steroid therapy. The current state of the art will be reviewed, together with emphasis on the most recent controversial issues of the day.MethodsData will be presented from specific studies, meta-analyses and systematic review of each of three issues and their interactions (surfactant, prenatal and postnatal steroids)Allergy and the GutA NietoPaediatric Allergy Unit, Childrens Hospital La Fe, Valencia, SpainBackground and AimsThe gut is the way through which the greatest number of substances, and the highest quantities of them come into the body. Many of these substances have high allergenic properties. At the same time considerable number of substances that reach the gut, have enzymatic activity. Thus it is possible that these substances are able to induce injuries in the intestinal mucosa, so disrupting the intestinal barrier, and permitting the pass of allergens into the circulation. Furthermore, there are many evidences that suggest that Allergy is a systemic disease, with a local expression. Thus, and considering the allergic child as a whole, it is convenient to consider the gut, not as a isolated entity, but more properly as an organ interconnected with others which constitute the integral Mucosal Immune System (MIS). The interactions between different organs involved in the MIS are critical in the development of localized symptoms. In consequence, from an allergologic point of view, the gut should be observed: A) As a barrier element, that blocks the pass to the systemic circulation of substances able to develop systemic or remote localized allergic symptoms. B) As a crucial element for the development of immunologic tolerance during the first days/weeks of life. C) As a direct target organ for digestive allergic sensitizations. D) As an indirect target organ for allergic sensitizations acquired through other ways. In the case of predominant digestive symptoms, diagnostic difficulties are remarkable, because of: The similarity of digestive allergic symptoms with other gastro-enterologic diseases. The existence of different immunologic mechanisms involved in the development of food hypersensitivity phenomena. The possibility that the hypersensitivity phenomenon be locally restricted, without a detectable systemic reflection. This can happens in the earlier stages of sensitization.Oral Tolerance: Where are We?A MuraroDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Padua, ItalyAbstract not available at the time of printing.Successful Therapy of Unspecific Prolonged Diarrhoea in Infants and Toddlers with the Probiotic E. Coli Nissle 1917J H Henker1, B M Blokhin2, Y K Bolbot3, V G Maydannik4, C W Wolff5, J S Schulze51Universitätsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus Der TU Dresden, Germany, 2Russian State Medical University, Moscow, Russia, 3Dnepropetrovsk State Medical Academy, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, 4National Medical University O.O. Bogomolets, Kyiv, Ukraine 5Ardeypharm, Herdecke, GermanyBackground and AimsSo far no causal therapy exists for infants and toddlers with prolonged diarrhoea. Therefore in a confirmatory, randomized, double-blind clinical trial the efficacy of the probiotic bacterial strain E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as compared to a placebo was tested.Methods151 children (aged 1 to 47 months, with unspecific prolonged diarrhoea (&gt; 3 watery or loose stools without blood in 24 hours of a diarrhoeal episode, which has been persisting for more than 4 consecutive but less than 14 days) were randomized to receive either EcN suspension (n = 75) or placebo (n = 76). All children were dehydrated to a medium extent (5 – 10% loss of body weight) and received 1 to 3 ml verum or placebo orally per day depending on the age (1 ml verum contained 10E8 viable EcN bacteria) for 21 days. At study commencement, rehydration (ORL according to WHO) was performed once.The Natural History of Cow's Milk Protein Sensitisation in Infantile Allergic Colitis — An Association with Multiple Food Allergy?S L Chuang1, P Hayes3, J Falconer3, M Haddad3, T T MacDonald2, J M Fell31Department of Neonatology, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, UK, 2Division of Infection, Inflammation, and Repair, University of Southampton School of Medicine, Southampton, UK, 3Department of Paediatric Gastroenterology, Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsTo document the clinical outcome and evidence of persisting dietary sensitization, in particular, cow's milk protein (CMP), in infants with allergic colitis (AC).MethodsWe carried out a prospective study with comprehensive immunological, endoscopic, clinical evaluation and follow up for assessment of in vivo/in vitro evidence of CMP-sensitivity. 12 AC were diagnosed, median onset at 6weeks (2 days-7 months). Clinical CMP-sensitivity was defined by resolution of bloody diarrhoea on CMP exclusion (with maternal dairy exclusion or amino-acid formula) and subsequent rechallenge (open in breast-fed, double-blind challenge in amino-acid formula fed). Clinical reactions to sequential dietary antigen introduction during weaning (soya/wheat/egg etc.) were documented.Decreased Health Related Quality of Life in Obese AdolescentsM de Beer1, G H Hofsteenge2, J W Twisk3, H A Delemarre-van de Waal1, R J Gemke11Department of Pediatrics, 2Department of Dietetics, 3Department of Clinical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsHealth-related-quality-of-life (HRQoL) is an important indicator of chronic illness, complementary to clinical variables. Although overweight and obesity affect HRQoL, very few studies have assessed this in children and adolescents. In this study we compared HRQoL of obese adolescents with normal weight controls and we explored the relation of Body Mass Index (BMI) with HRQoL.MethodsCross-sectional study in 31 adolescents (12–18 yrs), referred for obesity, compared with 62 age and sex matched controls. HRQoL was assessed using the PedsQL and Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ). The main outcome measure was difference in reported HRQoL between the 2 groups and the association of BMI with HRQoL in both groups.Effect of Domperidone on Gastroesophageal Reflux in Newborns Assessed By Combined Intraluminal Impedance and Ph MonitoringF Cresi, C Marinaccio, F Savino, L Silvestro, R MinieroDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Turin, ItalyBackground and AimsGastroesophageal reflux (GER) is common in the neonate. If conservative procedures fail to relieve it, the use of a prokinetic agents is justified. Domperidone has been shown to increase LES pressure, to improve esophageal peristalsis and gastric emptying in children. Aim of this study was to evaluate effect of domperidone on gastroesophageal reflux in newborns assessed by combined intraluminal impedance (MII) and pH monitoring.MethodsWe performed a paired case control study in 26 formula fed newborns with GERD symptoms referred to our Neonatal Care Unit. The patients were consecutively enrolled and alternatively assigned to the case or control group. MII and pH monitoring were followed for 24 hr. Patients in the treatment group received domperidone (0.2 mg/Kg dose q8 hr). Simultaneous MII and pH monitoring identified reflux episodes and illustrated their duration, height and pH. Cases were matched to the control group. They were paired by gestational age and weight. Differences were evaluated with the t-test for paired values with p&lt;0.05 as the significance cut-off. Written consent was obtained from the parents.Inhibitory Effect the Herbal Formulation of Matricaria Recutita, Foeniculum Vulgare Melissa Officinalis on Upper Gastrointestinal Transit in Mice in VivoR Capasso2, F Savino1, F Capasso21Department of Pediatrics, University of Turin, Italy, 2Department of Experimental Pharmacology, University of Naples, ItalyBackground and AimsClinical evidence suggests that a phytotherapeutic formulation containing Matricaria recutita flowers extract, Foeniculum vulgare fruit extract and Melissa officinalis aerial parts (ColiMil®) is effective in the treatment of breastfed colicky infants (1). We have now investigated the effect of different dosages of herbal constituents on upper gastrointestinal transit in mice in vivo to enhance our acknowledgement on its supposed dose-dependent effect.MethodsWe have used 16 groups of 10 Male ICR mice (20–22 g) for each experimental group. The mice received orally 0.1ml/10g mouse of a black marker (10% charcoal suspension in 5% gum arabic) 1 h before oral administration of phytotherapeutic formulation (0.1–0.4 ml/mouse), Matricariae recutita (0.22–0.89 mg/mouse), Foeniculum vulgare (2.05–8.21 mg/mouse) or Melissa officinalis (1.61–6.46 mg/mouse). After 20 min the mice were killed by asphyxiation with CO2 and the gastrointestinal tract removed. The distance travelled by the marker was measured and expressed as a percentage of the total length of the small intestine from pylorus to caecum.Lung Development and InflammationA H JobeProfessor of Neonatal Paediatrics, Department of Pulmonary Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USABackground and AimsInflammation is central to virtually all lung injury syndromes in the newborn and adult. I will focus on antenatal and early postnatal inflammatory effects on the preterm lung, as the effects are directly relevant to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The chorioamnionitis frequently associated with preterm delivery has two disparate effects on the fetal lung — an injury similar to mild BPD with alveolar simplification and microvascular injury and induced lung maturation. The lung maturation results in less clinical RDS but many of these infants progress to BPD, perhaps because they have augmented inflammatory responses to postnatal pro-inflammatory stimuli such as resuscitation, lung stretch, and oxygen exposure.MethodsWe have used fetal sheep models to demonstrate that intra-amniotic pro-inflammatory mediators such as E. coli endotoxin, IL-1, or Ureaplasma organisms cause chorioamnionitis and lung inflammation. Following the fetal exposures to intraamniotic mediators, the fetal lungs are assessed for inflammation (inflammatory cells, cytokine expression, vascular injury), and lung maturation (gas exchange, lung gas volumes, surfactant).Surfactants Today and TomorrowH L HallidayRoyal Maternity Hospital and Honorary Professor of Child Health, Queens University Belfast, Northern IrelandBackground and AimsSurfactant treatment is now about 25 years old and it has undoubtedly had a major impact on neonatal care and outcomes. The aim was to search for recent clinical trials of surfactant treatment and report their results.MethodsRecent was defined as published between 2000 and 2005. PubMed was searched on 31st December 2005 using the following terms: surfactant treatment, neonate and clinical trials, with limits of years 2000 to 2005 and age newborn to 1 month. Randomised clinical trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews of RCTs were given priority and studies in children, adults and animals were excluded.Long Term Respiratory Outcome Following Pre-Term DeliveryJ StocksProfessor of Neonatal Paediatrics, Respiratory Physiology, UCL, Institute of Child Health, London, UKBackground and AimsAdvances in neonatal care over the last three decades have resulted in increased survival of extremely preterm infants. However, the prevalence of pulmonary sequelae has not declined as might have been hoped or expected from improved management, thereby increasing the burden of respiratory health care delivery.MethodsThe residual respiratory problems of preterm, low birth weight infants following discharge from neonatal intensive care often persist into childhood with significant respiratory morbidity, including frequent cough and wheeze. Even in the absence of such symptoms, there may be sub-clinical changes associated with airway obstruction, hyperinflation, increased airway reactivity and exercise limitation. These problems may improve with age and somatic growth in some individuals, but remain persistent in others. Although those who required a high level of intensive care or who developed chronic lung disease of infancy/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are more likely to be affected beyond infancy, these adverse effects have also been observed in children born prematurely but without significant neonatal disease. Improved ongoing surveillance of individuals born preterm is essential if we are to understand the mechanisms and long term impact of such early life insults.A New Approach to Acceleration of Fetal Lung Maturation by PioglitazoneF Guthmann, B RüstowDepartment of Neonatology, Charite-CCM, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsThe use of antenatal glucocorticoids is one of the most important reasons for the decreasing mortality of premature infants. However, even with doses scaled to match those used in clinical treatment of humans, side effects occurred in animal brains. Thus, by studying a new approach we aim to induce fetal lung maturation either instead of steroids or supplemental to steroids.MethodsWe determined the expression of i) SP-B which appears to be the most important apoprotein of the surfactant with regard to the development of a respiratory-distress syndrome, ii) SP-C, which increases surfactant spreading and stability, and iii) ABCA3, a transporter protein in the membrane of lamellar bodies whose expression is inducible by corticosteroids in fetal rat. ABCA3 is expressed in the rat in a development-specific manner, and is detected earliest at day 20.5, i.e. shortly before birth.Lung Function in Heterozygote Carriers of ABCA3 MutationsO Danhaive1, A Dotta1, A Turchetta2, D Peca3, F Savignoni1, F Morini4, C Corchia11Division of Neonatal Intensive Care, 2Division of Sport Medicine and Pulmonary Function, 3Laboratory of Neonatal Biology, 4Division of Neonatal Surgery, Bambino Gesu Children's Hospital, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsABCA3 is a type II pneumocyte phospholipid carrier essential for surfactant synthesis. ABCA3 deficiency causes lethal neonatal RDS and pediatric interstitial lung disease. Most cases carry ABCA3 mutations on both alleles. We investigated relatives of ABCA3-deficient infants for determining whether heterozygosis leads to subclinical respiratory impairment.MethodsGenotype was determined by sequencing of PCR-amplified genomic DNA in neonates with suspected genetic surfactant deficiency and relatives. Airway patency was measured by FEV1 in all, except neonates in whom tPTEF/Te was used; functional lung volumes were measured by RV/TLC, except in neonates in whom Vt was used. Alveolar exchange was measured by carbon monoxide diffusion capacity (KCO) in subjects &gt;5 years, and estimated by PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;5 years.Human Pulmonary Nitric Oxide Synthases (NOS) and Nitrotyrosine: Findings During Neonatal Development and Chronic Lung Disease (CLD)M J Sheffield1, D W Thibeault2, S Mabry2, W E Truog21Division of Neonatology, Department of Women and Children, McKay Dee Hospital, Intermountain Health Care, Ogden, UT, USA, 2Section of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, The Children's Mercy Hospitals and Clinics, University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine, Kansas City, MO, USABackground and AimsNitric Oxide (NO) is a mediator of pulmonary transition to postnatal life. Prematurity and CLD of prematurity may alter ontogeny of NOS expression or function of the NO pathways. NOS presence and NO production in fetal lungs have not been correlated. One key pathway of NO metabolism results in nitrotyrosine, a stable, measurable marker of NO production. We compared, by semiquantitative immunohistochemistry (IHC), NOS isoforms and nitrotyrosine at different pulmonary airway and vascular levels in neonates at different gestations and severities of CLD.MethodsPostmortem lung blocks were compared using IHC, with antibodies to each NOS isoform and nitrotyrosine. Blinded observers evaluated airway and vascular trees for staining intensity (0–3 scale). Controls, postconceptional age 22–42 week infants who died in s&lt;48 hours, were compared to gestational-matched infants with varying CLD severity.Respiratory Complications in Children with Neuromuscular DisordersB FaurouxAP-HP, Hopital Armand Trousseau, Department of Pediatric Pulmonary, Research Unit INSERM U719, Universite Pierre et Marie Curie — Paris 6, FranceBackground and AimsIn patients with neuromuscular diseases, the development of respiratory muscle weakness represents the major determinant of the respiratory morbidity and mortality. As such, the measurement of lung volumes have been demonstrated to be an useful marker of the severity of the respiratory disease in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (1). Routine evaluation of forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure and peak cough flow is suggested early in the course of the disease by the American Thoracic Society (2). However, noninvasive volitional tests of lung and respiratory muscle function can be misleading because these tests require aptitude, cooperation, motivation and coordination, which explains that reliable measures may be difficult to obtain in young children.MethodsIn order to evaluate inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength in children with various neuromuscular diseases, 41 patients, aged 2 to 18 years, with DMD (n=20), spinal amyotrophy (n=8), and congenital myopathy (n=13), were asked to perform a sniff and a cough maneuver, as well as a FVC maneuver. In addition, diaphragmatic strength was assessed by a nonvolitional test, i.e the magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves (TwPdi) (3).Phox2B Gene and the Intimate Relationship with DysautonomyC GaultierDepartment of Physiology, Hôpital Robert Debré, Paris, FranceBackground and AimsCongenital central hypoventilation syndrome, Hirschsprung disease, and neuroblastomas can occur in combination, and familial cases have been reported in all three conditions. This suggests variable expression of a single genetic abnormality as the common cause to these neural crest disorders. Because the PHOX2B gene is pivotal in the development of most relays of the autonomic nervous system, including all autonomic neural crest derivatives, it was considered a candidate gene for the above conditions.MethodsMolecular genetic analyses were performed in children with CCHS, Hirschsprung disease, and neuroblastomas.Cognition and Anxiety-Related Behavior, Synaptophysin- and Map2-Immunoreactivity in the Adult Rat Treated with a Single Course of Antenatal BetamethasoneM Bruschettini1,2,3,5, D L A van den Hove1,2,5, S Timmers1, M Welling1, J Prickaerts1, D Gazzolo3,4, C E Blanco2, H W M Steinbusch1,51Department of Psychiatry and Neuropsychology, Division of Neuroscience, University of Maastricht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pediatrics, Research Institute Growth and Development (GROW), Faculty of Medicine, University of Maastricht, The Netherlands, 3G. Gaslini Children's Hospital, University of Genoa, Italy, 4Maternal Fetal and Neonatal Health, G Garibaldi Hospital, Catania, Italy, 5European Graduate School of Neuroscience (EURON), University of Maastricht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsTo investigate the effects of a single course of antenatal betamethasone on cognitionand anxiety-related behavior and synaptophysin- and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2)- immunoreactivity in the adult rat hippocampus.MethodsOn day 20 of gestation pregnant rats were injected with either 1) 170 ώg kg-1 body weight of betamethasone (‘clinically-equivalent dose’, equivalent to 12 mg twice, 24 hours apart), 2) Half this dose or 3) Vehicle. Cognition- and anxiety- related behavior of the offspring was analyzed at an age of 5 months using the Morris water maze, object recognition task and open field test. Subsequently, synaptophysin- and MAP2- immunoreactivity were measured in the hippocampus.Neonatal Oral Imitation in Patients with Severe Motor DysfunctionT Go1, M Yamaoka2, E Shimokawa2, M Hoshide2, H Kobe2, H Shinoda2, K Uchida2, A Hagiwara2, M Sato2, Y Konishi11Department of Infants’ Brain and Cognitive Development, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, Japan, 2Department of Rehabilitation, Saitama Medical Center for the Disabled, Saitama, JapanBackground and AimsBabies have been shown to reproduce mouth opening and closing in response to an adult model within a few hours after birth. This neonatal oral imitation is observed only in humans and great apes such as chimpanzees, indicating that this oral function is innate and mostly specific in humans. In this study, we investigated the possibility whether patients with severe motor dysfunction demonstrated similar imitation seen in neonate.MethodsFourteen patients were included in this study. They were rarely able to vocalize or move their extremities voluntarily. First, a therapist sang a favorite song of each patient for five minutes. Then, the therapist sang a part of it repeatedly with mouse widely and slowly open while making eye contact with the patient. Patients were evaluated as being able to perform oral imitation when they opened their mouth repeatedly in response to the therapists’ oral movement.Isolated Language Regression is Strongly Associated with Electrographic Status Epilepticus in SleepO Ekinci, E Trevathan, N Reed, U Isik, L L Thio, J Zempel, M Wong, C Gurnett, S ArnoldDivision of Pediatric and Developmental Neurology, Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, St. Louis Children's Hospital, St. Louis, MO, USABackground and AimsWe determined the factors associated with electrographic status epilepticus in sleep (ESES) and sleep-activated epileptiform abnormalities (SAEA) among children with autism and/or regression referred for EEG-video studies.MethodsData on all children who were referred for 24- hour EEG-video monitoring from 1995–2005 with a question of possible ESES or SAEA were entered into a database for analysis. Senior pediatric neurologists evaluated all children at the time of admission to determine whether children met diagnostic criteria for autism or an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), or if they had isolated language regression (language regression without autistic features).Pyridoxine Dependent Seizures (PDS) in The Netherlands: Study of Aminoadipine-Semi-Aldehyde (ASAA) and Pipecolic Acid (PA)L A Bok1, J V Been2, M A Willemsen3, E Struys4, C Jakobs41Department of Paediatrics, Máxima Medical Centre, Veldhoven, The Netherlands, 2Department of Paediatrics, Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands, 3Department of Paediatric Neurology, Radboud University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 4Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsPDS is a rare, autosomal recessively inherited disorder. Recently PDS was shown to result from AASDH (antiquitin) deficiency, elevated levels of both AASA and PA, that can be used to confirm the diagnosis.MethodsWe reevaluated the recently reported series of Dutch PDS patients (Arch Dis Child 90:1293–1296) by measuring AASA and PA in urine and plasma of all patients (n=13). Because of the ongoing epidemiologic study newly diagnosed patients could be added (n=6).Brain Differential Gene Expression Following 72 Hours of Graded Hyperoxia in Neonatal RatsD Torbati1, B R Totapally1, J Osborne2, L van Zyl3, S Kalomiris1, A Raszynski11Division of Critical Care Medicine, Miami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL, USA, 2Department of Statistics, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NC, USA 3ArrayXpress, Raleigh, NC, USABackground and AimsHyperoxia and Hyperoxemiainduced oxidative stress may modulate the expression of specific genes in various organs. Whereas the effects of hyperoxia and hyperoxemia on the developing lungs and retina have been well documented, their effects on developing brain have not been systematically studied. Therefore, we examined, in the present study, differential gene expression in whole brain of neonatal rats exposed to 3 days of normobaric hyperoxia before the onset of the clinical signs of pulmonary oxygen toxicity.MethodsSixteen newborn male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into an hyperoxia-treated group (72 h, consisting of 98%, 60% and 40% O2 breathing at days 1–3, respectively), or controls (21% O2) (n=8 in each group). After 72 hours, the pups were euthanized and their brain was rapidly removed and analyzed for differential gene expression, using 9984 oligonucleotide rat array. Samples from both groups were assigned to single slides for the purpose of direct (low variance) comparison. Bonferroni correction was used to control the experimental Type I error at alpha level of 0.05.End-of-Life Decisions in Neonates and Infants in Belgium and The NetherlandsL Deliens1, A M Vrakking21End-of-Life Care Research Group, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium, 2Department of Public Health, Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsRecently, in both Belgium (Flanders) and the Netherlands, studies have been done to get insight in the practice of end-of-life decision-making for neonates and infants. We compared the results to gain insight in similarities and differences between these countries.MethodsQuestionnaires were sent to physicians who reported the death of a child who died under the age of one (Belgium: n=292, response 87%; Netherlands: n=249, response 84%). The questionnaires included structured questions about whether death had been preceded by end-of-life decisions, and about the decision-making process.End of Life Decisions in Critically Ill Infants; Diversity Within EuropeP J J SauerDepartment of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, The NetherlandsWithin Europe a variety in opinions exists among neonatologists and intensivists concerning the question when to start and when to stop or continue life-saving treatment in a critically ill infant. In some countries physicians feel they have the obligation to discuss these issues with parents and, ultimately, to make decisions while in other countries physicians are convinced that these decisions are not part of the medical domain. Quality of life aspects are taken into account in the decision-making process in some countries while in other countries the future quality of life can never be an argument in these decision-making processes. Next to the future quality of life, the presence of suffering can be an aspect in the decision-making process. In some countries physicians are convinced that all suffering can always be sufficiently and effectively treated with medication. In The Netherlands it is accepted that it is not possible to effectively alleviate suffering in all patients with medication and that active ending the life in some infants can be the only way to alleviate suffering. In these extreme situations actively ending the life of an infant is considered to be acceptable in The Netherlands, while in other countries it is considered to be murder. Are opinions regarding these ethical questions indeed very different between countries, and if so, do we know why these differences exist? Or, on the other hand, is it mainly the way we discuss these inssues. In my opinion differences in opinion exist. However, they are not as extreme as they might like. Secondly, physicians are influenced by the cultural and religious environment, and also by the legal system. An open discussion regarding these issues is very important within Europe. Not that one opinion is superior over the other, but these discussions can help physicians in different countries to make their view and thereby the decision making more clear and explicit. Discussing these issues therefore is not telling what is wrong and what is right, but will help to make proper decisions. Ethics is not the science that makes decisions, but the science that helps to assistent by formulating the proper questions in the decision-making process.Care at the End-of-Life in the Paediatric Intensive Care UnitC Pal1, P Habibi21Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, St Mary's Hospital NHS Trust, London, 2Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UKBackground and AimsMany deaths on a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) can be anticipated. This gives an opportunity to share decisions with parents, and manage a child's end of life care accordingly. We present a review of deaths on a PICU over a 30 month period and three cases to illustrate differences in end of life care.MethodsThe ‘mode’ of death of all children who died in 2003–2006 was categorised: 1. brain stem death, 2. unsuccessful attempts at resuscitation, 3. withdrawal/limitation of therapy. In the latter, the circumstances leading to this decision were noted along with the process, timing and place of therapy withdrawal.With Care: Teaching Compassionate Withdrawal of Life Support in the Nicu. What do Parents Want?C Williams1, J Cairnie1, L Lohfeld2, C Patey1, V Fines1, K Schwarzer1, H Kirpalani11McMaster University Health Sciences Centre 2McMaster University, Hamilton, ON, CanadaBackground and AimsGeographic variations in physician practices of withdrawal of life sustaining treatment (WLST) are reported. However, practical aspects of decision making, the withdrawal process and how to support bereaved parents are poorly described. Moreover, parents#x2019; perspectives are infrequently discussed. Our purpose was to generate key elements of importance from parents who had experienced WLST in the NICU.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with parents of infants who underwent WLST within the last 3 years in a tertiary NICU. Parents were asked to describe the events surrounding discussions of decision making, WLST, and follow-up care. Interviews continued to saturation, then were independently coded and reduced.End of Life Decisions in Newborns and Children: Experiences of a Local Review CommitteeM A van der Hoeven1, D van Waardenburg1, C E Blanco1, N de Bijl2, G de Wert3, G Widdershoven41Department of Paediatric Medicine, University Hospital Maastricht, 2Department of Health Law, Faculty of Health Sciences, University Maastricht, 3Faculty of Medicine, Section Health Ethics and Philosophy, University Maastricht, 4Care and Public Health Research Institute, University Maastricht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn a third level university hospital a review committee on End-of-life care in Children in the Academic Hospital Maastricht (RECAM) was formed to review medical decision-making surrounding the deaths of children younger than 16 years old.MethodsA set of criteria was formulated: the establishment of diagnosis and prognosis of the illness, hopeless and unbearable suffering, communication with the parents, the consultation with other physicians, and the performance of the end of life care.Should Neonates or Infants be Denied the Right to Life: The Legal Implications of Life-Threatening Decisions in England and WalesR StanleyFaculty of Health and Social Care Sciences, Kingston University and St. George's University of London, Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, UKBackground and AimsChildren too young and immature to be competent depend on their parents to fulfil their rights to good health and medical care. The advances made by medical technology nevertheless sometimes confront parents and doctors alike with difficult dilemmas over what is the appropriate decision to make. Does a child, for example, have a right to life, at whatever the cost? In questions like this the medical profession wields considerable power and it is the doctors who may in reality decide how best to fulfil a child's rights. In the event of a dispute between parents and doctors, the courts may be asked to intervene. At that point, medical paternalism may be replaced by judicial paternalism, with the child's own perspectives slipping into second place. This aim of this analysis of the neonates#x2019; right to life (or death) deals with the extent to which children's right to life can be endangered by decisions relating to their. Specifically this discussion will address 3 objectives: (i) The limits to parents#x2019; powers and the relevance of physical or mental handicap (ii) A child's right to life and parents#x2019; objections to lifesaving treatment. (iii) Withholding treatment from desperately ill babies.MethodsThis discussion brings together the analytic methodologies of jurisprudence and philosophy. As legal philosophy is nothing else that general philosophy applied to law, it uses the same methodology as philosophy in general. Legal theory, for its part, lays an emphasis on plural and interdisciplinary approaches, in addition to the more traditional analytical methodology.Cardiovascular Risk Factors at Age 30 Following Preterm BirthS R Dalziel1,2,3, V Parag3, A Rodgers3, J E Harding21Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK, 2Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland, New Zealand 3Clinical Trials Research Unit, The University of Auckland, New ZealandBackground and AimsRecent epidemiological evidence has shown increased rates of cardiovascular mortality and associated risk factors in those born small. However scarce information exists concerning cardiovascular risk factors in adulthood following preterm birth, or distinguishing the relative contributions of length of gestation and fetal growth to small size at birth.MethodsProspective follow-up of 458 thirty-year olds whose mothers took part in a randomised controlled trial of antenatal betamethasone for the prevention of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (147 born at term, 311 born preterm). Follow-up assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, blood lipids, early morning cortisol levels and 75g oral glucose tolerance test.Risk Stratification And Effectiveness of Intravenous Immunoglobulin Plus Predonisolone as the Initial Treatment of Kawasaki DiseaseK Ikeda1, T Kobayashi2, Y Inoue2, Y Okada2, T Tomomasa2, M Shinohara2, T Kobayashi1, K Takeuchi3, A Morikawa21Department of Cardiology, Gunma Children's Medical Center, Shibukawa, Gunma, Japan, 2Department of Pediatrics and Developmental Medicine, Gunma University Graduate School of Medicine, Maebashi, Gunma, Japan, 3Department of Health and Welfare, Takasaki University of Health and Welfare, Takasaki, Gunma, JapanBackground and AimsWe reported that the combination of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) plus predonisolone as the initial treatment of Kawasaki disease (KD) proved more effective in preventing coronary artery abnormalities than IVIG alone. However, the routine use of corticosteroids may demand careful study because they can be associated with potential adverse reactions. This study aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of IVIG plus predonisolone by risk stratification.Methods178 KD patients were randomly assigned to either an IVIG group (n=88) or an IVIG plus predonisolone (IVIG+PSL) group (n=90). KD patients were stratified into high or low risk groups by a risk score developed to predict IVIG unresponsiveness from a multiple logistic regression analysis using our institutions 750 consecutive KD patients.The Significance of Birth Before 28 Weeks of Gestation for Neonatal Mortality and Morbidity. A National Population-Based StudyH Wold1, K Sommerfelt1, H Reigstad1, A Rønestad2, S Medbø3, K Danielsen4, S Spangen5, P A Tølløsrud6, G Zanussi7, T Farstad8, P I Kaaresen9, T Markestad11Department of Pediatrics, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway, 2Department of Pediatrics, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway 3Department of Pediatrics, Ullevål University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 4Department of Pediatrics, Sørlandet Hospital, Kristiansand, Norway, 5Department of Pediatrics, Ålesund Hospital, Ålesund, Norway 6Department of Pediatrics, Buskerud Hospital, Drammen, Norway, 7Department of Pediatrics, Stavanger University Hospital, Stavanger, Norway 8Department of Pediatrics, Akershus University Hospital, Lørenskog, Norway, 9Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital of Northern Norway, Tromsø, NorwayBackground and AimsTo evaluate the effect of being small for gestational age (SGA), defined as birth weight less than the fifth percentile for gestational age, on neonatal mortality and morbidity.MethodsIn this study, prospective data was collected on all births of 22 to 27 completed weeks of gestation, or a birth weight of 500 to 999 g born during the years, 1999 and 2000 in Norway. Of 636 births, 174 infants were stillborn or died in the delivery room, and data from the remaining 462 were included in the study. Of these, 86 died in the NICU, 87 (19 percent) infants had birth weight &lt; 5p (SGA), and 372 (81 percent) infants had birth weight &gt;= 5p (AGA). Mortality and presence of selected neonatal morbidity such as severe cerebral haemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), periventricular leukomalaci, retinopathy of prematurity, chronic lung disease (CLD- defined as need of oxygen at 36 weeks), persistent ductus arteriosus and total days on ventilator/CPAP were compared between the two groups.Sildenafil Prevents Rebound Pulmonary Hypertension (PHT) After Discontinuation of Inhaled Nitric Oxide (NO) in Children: A Randomised, Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled StudyP Namachivayam1, D J Penny2, U Thelien1, S Cooper1, R Taib3, C Stocker4, W Butt1, L S Shekerdemian41Intensive Care Unit, Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, 2Department of Cardiology and The Australian and New Zealand Childrens Heart Research Centre, Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, 3Department of Cardiology, Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, Australia, 4Intensive Care Unit and The Australian and New Zealand Childrens Heart Research Centre, Royal Childrens Hospital, Melbourne, AustraliaBackground and AimsNO reduces PVR, improves oxygenation without altering systemic haemodynamics. Rebound PHT upon withdrawal of NO causes desaturation, hypotension and major instability. Sildenafil, a pulmonary vasodilator increases intrinsic cGMP levels by preventing its breakdown Aim is to establish whether sildenafil has a role in the preventing rebound PHTMethodsInfants ventilated and receiving NO at 5 parts per million (ppm) or more were eligible. 30 infants were randomised to enteral sildenafil (0.35mg/kg) or placebo. NO weaned by 1 ppm every half hour and study drug given when NO was weaned to 2 ppm. Arterial pressure, CVP, HR, O2 saturations, ABG and PAP were recorded. Data expressed as means (SD) or median (ranges)Correlation of Gestational age with Expression of Epithelial Sodium Channel (ENaC) in Airway Epithelium of Newborn InfantsC Janér, O Helve, O Pitkänen, S AnderssonHospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki, FinlandBackground and AimsThe fetal lung is filled with liquid that is removed perinatally. Animal experimentation has shown that epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is rate limiting for clearance of this liquid. In the newborn mouse knock-out of the alpha subunit of the ENaC gene results in early death due to respiratory distress. Human infants that die of respiratory distress shortly after birth have been shown to have a high fluid content of the lungs. Delayed fluid absorption because of low expression of ENaC may thus play a role in the pathogenesis of respiratory distress in the preterm human infant. We therefore studied whether in the early postnatal period a relationship exists between airway expression of subunits of ENaC and gestational age in newborn infants.MethodsFrom 74 newborn infants with gestational age of 26–42 weeks scrape samples from nasal epithelium were taken within 1–6 hours after birth. The expression of alpha, beta and gamma subunit of ENaC was quantified using RT-PCR.Transport of Newborns with Acute Lung Failure in the Pre-ECMO Situation and on ECMOM Schindler, S Dahlmann, I Berlett, F LoerschUniversity Childrens Hospital, Mannheim, GermanyBackground and AimsAlthough ventilation and postpartal management of sick newborns has been optimized, ECMO remains a therapeutic option in the neonatal intensive care of acute lung failure. The ECMO-center Mannheim has performed about 300 ECMO cases since 1987, and currently performs about 25 ECMOs per year. 50 infants per year are evaluated for the option of ECMO-therapy. Half of them are born at the center and the others are transported to the ECMO-center. Some children are too ill for conventional transport, in which case iNO, HFOV or mobile ECMO is necessary.New Technology in Brain Imaging in the NeonateP S HüppiDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Geneva, Geneva, SwitzerlandDespite marked improvements in perinatal practice, perinatal brain injury remains one of the most common complications causing chronic handicapping conditions. In recent years remarkable experimental advances have elucidated many of the cellular and vascular mechanisms of perinatal brain damage showing a correlation between the nature of the injury and the maturation of the brain. Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques have recently provided us with new data on fine structural alteration of the brain in these high risk newborns and have helped us to understand the brains structural alterations and their consequences for later brain development. MRI provides unequaled sensitivity as compared to CT or ultrasound for evaluating developmental changes and the pathological processes in the perinatal brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a recent MR modality which assesses water diffusion in biological tissues at a microstructural level, has revealed a powerful technique to explore the structural basis of normal brain development. In fact, the tissue organization can be probed non-invasively, and the age-related changes of diffusion parameters (mean diffusivity, anisotropy) reveal important maturational processes, such as white matter myelination. Early detection of brain injury is crucial for interventions aimed at preventing and reversing ongoing injury. DTI can show early changes at the cellular level that are not detectable by any other imaging modality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) further allows us to some extent to study the underlying metabolic mechanisms that define the pathophysiologic events that take place in perinatal brain injury. Understanding early human brain connectivity is of great clinical importance, as many neurological and neurobehavioral disorders have their origin in early structural and functional cerebral organization. With the development of 3D fiber tractography, based on DTI, the maturation of white matter connectivity can be followed throughout infant development into adulthood with the potential to study correlations between abnormalities on DTI and ultimate neurologic/cognitive outcome. The non-invasive technique of functional MRI can be considered as the leading technique for functional exploration of the infant's brain with localisation of functional brain activation upon sensory, motor and cognitive tasks. Advanced MRI in the newborn brain has allowed to study the structural correlate of early brain development and plasticity in the developing organism.Could Power Doppler (PD) be A Diagnostic Tool for Early Intervention in Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction (MCAI) in Neonates?M C Bravo1, A Pellicer1, L Dumandzic1, R Madero2, J Quero1, F Cabañas11Department of Neonatology, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain, 2Division of Statistics, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsAlthough lesion topography in MCAI appears crucial regarding outcome, the earlier the identification of events leading to structural brain damage the greater the possibility of intervention. To define the abnormalities of PD in patients with MCAI and whether altered PD patters could anticipate the diagnosis.MethodsCombined cerebral ultrasound (CUS): To evaluate changes in parenchymal echogenicity and PD studies and to assess for symmetry of flow and to measure blood flow velocity (BFV) —.Ventriculomegaly in ELGA Infants — A 3D MRI StudyS Horsch1, J Bengtsson2, A Nordell2, Z Nagy2, B Hallberg1, H Lagercrantz1, B Nordell2, U Ådén1, M Blennow31Neonatal Clinics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Department of Medical Physics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden 3Department of CLINTEC, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsCerebral ventriculomegaly at term age is an important predictor of adverse neurological outcome in preterms. It is associated to intraventricular haemorrhages (IVH) and periventricular leukomalcia (PVL), but is also observed in preterms without IVH/ PVL and then representing white matter loss and global cerebral atrophy. 3D MRI provides a valid assessment of ventricle volumes. To identify risk factors for the development of ventriculomegaly we correlated ventricular volumes at term age to perinatal data in a population based cohort of extremely low gestational age (ELGA) infants.Methods34 ELGA infants born in the Stockholm region were included (mean gestational age 25+3 weeks (SD 9 days); mean birth weight of 773g (SD 162g)). Infants were scanned at term equivalent age on a 1.5 T magnetic resonance system. A T1-weighted 3D-Spoiled-Gradient-Echo Sequence was used to perform volumetric measurements. Volume of the lateral ventricles was measured applying a software based on a semi-automatic Gradient Vector Flow Active Contour model.The Accuracy of A-EEG in Both Detecting Post-Asphyxial Neonatal Seizures and Classification of Background ActivityR Swarte1, J Perumpillichira2, G Visser2, P Govaert11Department of Neonatology, Erasmus MC, Sophia's Childrens Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Erasmus MC, Sophia's Childrens Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsAmplitude-integrated EEG (a-EEG, CFM) is widely used in NICU's. We want to assess the accuracy of a-EEG in both neonatal seizure detection and classification of background activity.Methods14 Full term neonates with asphyxia had seizures recorded on multi-channel EEG. Eight-hours-EEG segments were scored for onset, location, amplitude and frequency of electrographic seizures by a neurophysiologist. A-EEG with single-channel EEG (C3–4) were scored independently at paper speeds of 6 cm/hour and 30 cm/hour for seizures and amplitude of the background activity by a neurophysiologist and a neonatologist.Comparison of Doppler Measurements with Phase-Contrast (PC) Mr Angiography (MRA) Measurements of Cerebral Perfusion in NewbornsM J N L Benders1, J Hendrikse2, L S de Vries1, F van Bel1, F Groenendaal11Department of Neonatology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Radiology, University Medical Center Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsCerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations are important in the pathogenesis of neonatal ischemic brain damage. Estimations of CBF changes in newborns are mostly based on Doppler velocities in the basilar (BA) and internal carotid (ICA) arteries. Also with PC-MRA, blood flow can be obtained, but there is limited experience with this technique in newborns. Aim is to compare these two methods.MethodsWe compared BA and left/right-ICA's velocities obtained by Doppler velocities with two-dimensional PC-MRA measured velocities in 18 newborns. Two-D-PC slice was positioned at the skull base level to measure BA and ICA's volume flow. Immediately thereafter Doppler measurements of these blood vessels were performed. Angle-corrected-time-averaged flow-velocities were measured over 3–5 cardiac cycles.Accelerated Development in the Visual Areas of Preterm Infants: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study on Diffusion Tensor Mr Imaging (DTI)M J Miranda1, M Gimenez2, A P Born1, Z Nagy3, J Terry4, R Egill11Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance, Copenhagen University Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark 2Department of Psychiatry and Psychobiology, University of Barcelona, Spain, 3Department of Woman and Child Health, MR Unit, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, 4Laboratory of Cognitive Imaging (LOCI), La Jolla, CA, USABackground and AimsPremature birth has been related to delayed brain maturation. However, some studies suggest that the extrauterine environment stimulates development, and delayed maturation may therefore be associated with concomitant risk factors, rather than preterm birth itself. The possibility of more rapid maturation of certain brain areas has not yet been demonstrated. 1) To compare brain maturation in a sample of preterm neonates and a control group, and 2) to test the effect of postnatal age (PNA) in brain maturation.Methods27 healthy preterm neonates (mean GA 31w) and 10 full-term newborns (mean GA 39w) were included. Both groups were MR scanned at term-equivalent ages. Diffusion weighted EPI images were acquired on a Siemens Magneton Trio 3T scanner (b-value 1000 mm2/s, 6 directions). Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) images were calculated, and analysed using VBM technique: images were spatially normalised to a study specific template, and SPM2 tools were used for statistical analysis. We compared FA and ADC images using the two t-test comparison (control &gt; preterm; preterm &gt; control).Activation of Temporal Cortex in 6-Month Old Infants after Visual Exposure to Their Mother's Face and to an Unknown Face. A Near Infrared Spectroscopy StudyJ Carlsson1, M Bruschettini1,2, M Bartocci1, H Lagercrantz11Neonatal Research Unit, Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden 2G. Gaslini Children's Hospital, University of Genoa, ItalyBackground and AimsOne characteristic that makes human brain so unique is its ability at recognizing. Thus far little is known about neural mechanisms underling the capacity to discriminate objects/faces in human infants, mainly because there are few non-invasive techniques available. In this study we aimed to investigate, using a non-invasive technique such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), cortical activation-related haemodynamic changes in response to visual stimulation in 6-month old infants after exposure to a known and an unknown face.MethodsThirteen infants have been monitored. We have used 3 different types of visual stimuli: a grey background (GB), the photo of the mother face (MF) and the photo of an unknown person (UF). These images have been presented to the child, on a PC screen, in the following order: GB — MF — GB — UF, keeping the environment around the child as quite as possible. Changes in regional oxy [HbO2], deoxy-[HbH] and total hemoglobin [Hb tot] have been measured by NIRS in both temporal and occipital areas.High Resolution Visualisation of pH Changes in Mouse Neonatal Hypoxia IschemiaG S Kendall, N J Robertson, D Peebles, G RaivichDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Centre for Perinatal Brain Protection and Repair, University College London, UKBackground and AimsInfants with neonatal encephalopathy and experimental hypoxia-ischemia (HI) models show rebound brain intracellular alkalosis, this pH shift is known to correlate with neurodevelopmental outcome. Here we present an enhancement of neutral red spectrophotometry allowing regional pH measurements and creation of pseudocolour pH maps.MethodsP7 mice underwent left carotid occlusion and 90 minutes hypoxia. Following neutral red injection, animals were sacrificed and their brains snap frozen. The cut surface of the brain was captured using a camera with narrow bandwidth filters. pH was calculated using the 540nm/470nm absorbance ratios and a standard curve of brain homogenates at known pH.Metabolic Mapping: Multiple-Voxel Mrs and Lactate Pattern After Severe Birth AsphyxiaB Hallberg1, L Douglas2, S Horsch1, K Leisdottir1, M Mosskin3, B Nordell2, H Lagercrantz1, M Blennow11Neonatal Programme, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Medical Physics and MRI Unit, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 3Department of Neuroradiology, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsSeveral MR techniques are used to evaluate the degree of injury after hypoxicischemic insults in the newborn infant. Studies using single-voxel based techniques to obtain MR spectra have shown a good correlation between metabolic alterations and outcome. Objective: To develop and evaluate a multiple-voxel based MR-spectroscopy method and correlating metabolic information to the pattern of injury on conventional MRI and outcome.MethodsTen full term infants with severe birth asphyxia were included, (mean bw 3382 g, Sarnat score I=(1), II=(8), III=(1)). MRI examination on a 1.5 T MRI system was done at a median age of 7 days. MR-spectroscopic imaging was used for each patient 2D-MRS images were produced for choline, creatine, Naa, lactate and corresponding ratios using two different echo times, TE=136ms, TE=272ms, MRSI voxel volume 0.6–1.1 cm3. A bicubic interpolation was done of the 24×24 pixel images to 256×256 pixel metabolite images with the anatomical contour superimposed. MR images were scored by three independent observers using a predefined scoring system (Barkovich) defining the pattern of injury; Watershed, Basalganglia/Thalamus predominant or normal. MRS injury pattern were scored.3D Echocardiography in Congenital Heart DiseasesP AcarDepartment of Paediatric Cardiology, Hôpital des Enfants, Toulouse, FranceBackground and AimsThe introduction of real time three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography has led to its use in everyday clinical practice.MethodsThe 3D matrix probe enables the instantaneous acquisition of transthoracic volumes. Several modes of 3D are available: 3D volume, biplan and 3D color Doppler.Updated Results of the FETO Task Group as a Prelude to Set-Up of Clinical TrialsA Debeer1, J Jani4, K Allegaert1, E Gratacos3, S Salcedo3, A Greenough4, K H Nicolaides4, J Deprest21Department of Pediatrics/Neonatology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain, 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, King's College Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsTo review the effect of fetoscopic endoluminal tracheal occlusion (FETO) at 26–29 w on fetuses with severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and define a strategy for future clinical trials.MethodsEligibility for FETO was single fetus with severe CDH (lung-to-head ratio (LHR)&lt;1 and intrathoracic liver) without associated problems. FETO was at 26–29 wks gestational age (GA). Outcome measure was postnatal pulmonary outcome i.e. survival without, or death due to pulmonary hypoplasia and/or hypertension.Resuscitation with 100% O2 Causes Augmented Cerebral NecrosisJ H Andresen1, R Solberg1, B H Munkeby1, E M Løberg3, B Stray Pedersen2, O D Saugstad11Department of Pediatric Research, National Hospital, University of Oslo, Norway, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Hospital, University of Oslo, Norway, 3Department of Pathology, Ullevå University Hospital, Oslo, NorwayBackground and AimsSeveral studies have been undertaken on resuscitation with 100% oxygen versus room air. It has been shown that resuscitation with 100% oxygen has detrimental effects. We wish to investigate the effects of resuscitation with 100% oxygen on cerebral damage after hypoxic/ischemic injury compared to room air.MethodsTwo groups of newborn piglets (12–36 hours) were studied. They were randomized to either hypoxia or normoxia. The hypoxic group was randomized to be resuscitated with either 100% or 21% oxygen. Global hypoxia was induced by ventilation with 8% oxygen in N2 until Base Excess &lt; - 20 mmol/L or mean arterial blood pressure = 15 mmHg. After hypoxia the animals were observed for 150 min and then euthanized, the brains removed and the left hemisphere and cerebellum fixated in 10% buffered formalin. They were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and immunhistochemistry performed with anti-Microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2) antibodies, MAP-2 being a sensitive marker for ischemic cerebral damage. The HE-stainings and the immunhistochemistry were evaluated, blinded, by a pathologist.Developmental Care for Preterm Neonates: A Survey of Practices in European Neonatal UnitsM Cuttini1, A Maraschini1, G Greisen2, D Haumont3, C Pallàs4, V Pierrat5, B J Smith6, I Warren7, B Westrup8, J Sizun91Unit of Epidemiology, Paediatric Hospital Bambino Gesù, Rome, Italy, 2Department of Neonatology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, 3Neonatal Unit, St Pierre University Hospital, Brussels, Belgium 4Neonatal Unit, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain 5Centre Hospitalier Jeanne de Flandre, Lille, France 6Department of Neonatology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 7Winnicott Baby Unit, St. Mary's Hospital, London, UK, 8Neonatal Programme, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, 9Department of Paediatrics, Centre Hospitaliere de Brest, FranceBackground and AimsInterventions of “developmental care” are becoming popular in neonatal units to reduce infants’ distress and promote well-being. This study, supported by the European Science Foundation, estimates the frequency and patterns of implementation in different European countries.Methods279 neonatal units (response rate 78%) in eight countries (Belgium, Denmark, France, Italy, Netherlands, UK, Spain and Sweden) answered a structured questionnaire. Over 2/3 of units were 3rd level; median number of yearly &lt;1500 gr. admissions was 57 (from 23 in Sweden to 154 in Netherlands).Neonatal Outcome in Monochorionic Twins with Twin-to-Twin Transfusion Syndrome Managed by Intrauterine Laser Therapy and Dichorionic Twins: A Case Control StudyR Lenclen1, G Ciarlo1, A Paupe1, S Couderc2, F Castela1, P H Narcy1, Y Ville21Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier Poissy/St. Germain, Poissy, France 2Division of Fetal Medicine, Department of Obstetrics, Centre Hospitalier Poissy/St. Germain, Poissy, FranceBackground and AimsMonochorionic (MC) pregnancies complicated by twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) are at increased risk for prematurity as well as perinatal mortality and morbidity. Although perinatal outcome in TTTS has improved after laser therapy, neonatal mortality and morbidity remain high. The respective role of prematurity and of fatal disease are ill-defined. The objective of this study was to compare neonatal outcomes between TTTS infants and dichorionic (DC) twins, and to evaluate the impact of laser therapy.MethodsThis was a case-control retrospective study carried out at our center between 2000–2005. Neonatal outcome was assessed in 97 TTTS infants treated in utero with laser (n=56 pregnancies). Control group consisted of 97 DC twins (56 DC pregnancies) delivered between 24–34 weeks of gestation and matched for gestational age at birth with the cases.Enteral Glutamine Supplementation in the Neonatal Period in VLBW Infants: Effect on Incidence of Allergic and Infectious Diseases in the First Year of LifeA van den Berg1, A van Zwol1, H A Moll2, W P F Fetter1, R M van Elburg11Department of Pediatrics, Subdivision of Neonatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus Medical Center, Sophia Childrens Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn a previous, randomised controlled trial of enteral glutamine supplementation in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants the incidence of infectious morbidity was decreased in the glutamine-supplemented group. We hypothesize that glutamine-enriched enteral nutrition in the neonatal period may have consequences for the immune response to microorganisms and allergic antigens later in life and the incidence of allergic and infectious disease.MethodsThe parents of 89/102 surviving infants who participated in the initial study (13 infants died) were asked to complete a questionnaire on infectious and allergic disease during the first year of life. The questionnaire was adapted from two validated questionnaires, used in the PIAMA Study and the Generation R Study respectively. Logistic regression was used for data analysis. Corrections were made for possible confounding factors, as smoking at home, childcare attendance, siblings, infection during neonatal period and parental allergic disease.The Effect of Glycaemia on the TOI in Very Low Birth Weight InfantsJ L S Vanderhaegen, G Naulaers, S Vanhaesebrouck, C Vanhole, H Devlieger, P CasaerNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital UZ Gasthuisberg, Leuven, BelgiumBackground and AimsThe cerebral TOI (tissue oxygenation index) reflects the cerebral oxygenation. In this study we analyzed the effect of changes in glycaemia on the TOI, as measured by NIRS, in neonates.MethodsInclusion criteria were postmenstrual age less than 32 weeks and weight less than 1500 grams. In all patients at least 4 hours of continuous monitoring of TOI with NIRS (NIRO 300, Hamamatsu), glycaemia (Medtronic MiniMed CGMS System Gold), mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), saturation and if possible also tPCO2 was performed during the first days of life. The means of TOI, glycaemia, tPCO2 and MABP were calculated. Multiple regression analysis was performed correcting for saturation, MABP and if possible tPCO2.Pregnancy Complications and Outcome in Infants &lt; 32 Weeks Gestation: The Action StudyL Gagliardi1, M Da Frè2, E Buiatti2, V Carnielli3, C Corchia4, D Di Lallo5, F Macagno6, S Miniaci7, M Cuttini41Versilia Hospital, Versilia, Italy, 2Regional Health Authority, Florence, Italy, 3G Salesi Hospital, Ancona, Italy, 4Pediatric Hospital Bambino Gesù, Rome, Italy 5Agency for Public Health, Rome, Italy, 6Udine Hospital, Udine, Italy, 7Pugliese-Ciaccio Hospital, Catanzaro, ItalyBackground and AimsTo study the effect of pregnancy complications leading to preterm birth on outcome of very preterm infants.MethodsA cohort of NICU admitted infants &lt; 32 weeks, born in 2003–2004 in 6 Italian regions (ACTION study) was prospectively studied. Pregnancy complications and cause of preterm birth were grouped as follows: preterm labour (PTL: including prelabour rupture of membranes, infection); hypertensive disorders (HD: hypertension, preeclampsia, eclampsia, HELLP); Intra Uterine Growth Restriction (IUGR); placental haemorrhage; malformations. Outcomes were in-hospital mortality, and ultrasound-diagnosed white matter damage (WMD: periventricular leucomalacia and/or severe intraventricular haemorrhage) among survivors.New Diagnostic Techniques in Respiratory Medicine Beyond Lung Function: Investigation and Management of AsthmaE BaraldiDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Padova, ItalyThe inflammatory state of asthmatic airways may correlate weakly with clinical symptoms and lung function parameters, and that is why the development of non-invasive methods for inflammatory monitoring is very important in asthma. Exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurement FENO has been studied extensively, validated as a non-invasive marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma, and standardized for use in clinical practice. Guidelines for standardized FENO measurement have been published jointly by ATS and ERS and normal reference values with the recommended technique are available for children 4–17 years old. The single breath online method (SBOL) is the gold standard for FENO measurement in cooperating children. The child inhales NO-free air to near-total lung capacity, and then exhales at a constant flow of 50 ml/sec for at least 4 seconds. On-line FENO measurement during spontaneous breathing has been applied in children aged 2–5 years old, with the exhalation flow manually adjusted to 50 ml/sec by changing the exhalation resistance. The method is not well standardized, however, and still requires some passive co-operation. FENO may have a role as a diagnostic tool. Avital et al. showed that FENO can differentiate asthmatic young children from nonasthmatic cases with chronic cough. In addition, in children with recurrent wheezing, raised FENO values may be useful in identifying patients most likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). FENO measurement is also useful in asthma follow-up. In children, FENO levels have been demonstrated to predict asthma relapse after discontinuing steroids and to predict the failure of attempts to reduce ICS dosages. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) Exhaled breath condensate, obtained by cooling exhaled air, contains water vapor and micro-droplets, the composition of which is believed to reflect that of the airway lining fluid. EBC collection is totally non-invasive and easy to perform even in children. Recommendations have been recently published on how to collect EBC. The drawbacks of EBC analysis lie in that the concentrations of mediators in EBC are low, the anatomical sources of the compounds measured in EBC are not well defined and most of the measurements are not done in real time. A large number of mediators have been measured in EBC. Markers of oxidative stress- as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), isoprostanes, aldehydes and nitrotyrosine- are increased in asthmatic subjects, while glutathione (a protective lung antioxidant) is reduced. Beside, inflammatory metabolites, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs), have been found increased in allergic asthmatic children, despite corticosteroid treatment. Also, a reduced EBC pH has been reported in asthmatic children, suggesting that a dysregulation in airway pH homeostasis may have a role in asthma pathogenesis. Conclusion Exhaled nitric oxide has been established as a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma and recent studies have included FENO measurement in treatment algorithms. Exhaled breath condensate is a non-invasive technique for sampling the airways, which has the potential to offer new insight on lung disease pathobiology.Impact of Changing Practice with the Use of CPAPT del Moral, N Claure, S Vanbuskirk, E BancalariDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Miami, FL, USABackground and AimsEarly Continuous Positive Airway Pressure may reduce lung damage by decreasing the need for mechanical ventilation and it is increasingly used as an alternative strategy for ELBW infants with RDS. The objective of this study was to evaluate changes in the use of CPAP and the impact of these changes on the use of surfactant, mechanical ventilation, oxygen therapy and incidence of BPD.MethodsThe study included 606 neonates with BW between 500–1000g born at the University of Miami/Jackson Memorial Hospital during two periods of time (1998 to 2000 and 2002 to 2004). Outcome variables were compared between the two periods by χ2. All differences reported were statistically significant (p&lt;0.05).Additive Effects of KL4 and Polymers for Prevention of Surfactant InhibitionK W Lu, H W TaeuschDepartment of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco School of Medicine, San Francisco, CA, USABackground and AimsInactivation of pulmonary surfactant is caused by acute lung injuries and interferes with the effectiveness of surfactant replacement therapy in these diseases. Surfactant proteins, such as SP-B, and various ionic and nonionic polymers, such as hyaluronan (HA) or polyethylene glycol (PEG), can reduce inhibition of adsorption caused by serum. Our aim was to understand the interaction between an SP-B analogue and polymers in preventing serum inhibition of surfactant.MethodsWe used currently available surfactants, surfactant lipids, or surfactant lipids with either 0.4 or 0.8 mg/mL of KL4, a synthetic analogue of SP-B (Discovery Laboratories, Inc, USA). Mixtures (1.25 mg/mL) were studied in a pulsating bubble surfactometer that measures surface activity. HA 250 kDa, 0.25% w/v, or PEG 10 kDa, 5% w/v, were added to some mixtures.Is Decreasing Pressure or Increasing Time off the Better Strategy in Weaning Vlbw Infants from Nasal CPAP?S D Singh1, L Bowe1, P Clarke1, K Glover2, A Pasquill3, M J Robinson1, J Smith41NICU, Hope Hospital, Salford, UK, 2NICU, Royal Albert Edward Infirmary, Wigan, UK, 3NICU, Royal Bolton Hospital, Bolton, UK, 4NICU, Panorama Gardens Hospital, Cape Town, South AfricaBackground and AimsNasal CPAP (nCPAP) is currently used after extubation from mechanical ventilation. There is, however, uncertainty regarding the best approach to nCPAP weaning. Objective: To compare the effectiveness of pressure reduction with alternating periods of nCPAP with nasal cannula low flow oxygen (‘time off’) in weaning very low birthweight (VLBW) infants from nCPAP.MethodsInfants &lt;1500g, and stable in &lt;0.3 FIO2 on nCPAP were randomised to a weaning strategy of either gradual reduction of nCPAP ‘pressure’, or increasing duration of ‘time off’ nCPAP. Infants were considered successfully weaned if stable off nCPAP for 7 days.Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure Weaning in Preterm InfantsA Soe, J Hodgkinson, B Jani, D A DuckerOliver Fisher Neonatal Unit, Medway Maritime Hospital, Gillingham, Kent, UKBackground and AimsDuring weaning process from Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (NCPAP) in preterm infants, it is unclear whether weaning by pressure or time of CPAP is more effective. There are no published data available comparing the two methods.MethodsA prospective study was designed to compare the effects of the two different types of weaning, using infant flow driver. Preterm infants (gestation 24–31 weeks) with respiratory distress syndrome or immature lungs were randomly allocated to Time weaning or Pressure weaning and weaned over 6 days. The data were analysed according to stratification depending on the gestational age.Endotoxin Induced Chorioamnionitis Results in Maturation of Alveolar Macrophages by Transcription Factor PU.1 in Preterm SheepB W Kramer1,4, T J Moss2, I Nitsos2, J P Newnham2, C P Speer1, A H Jobe31University Children's Hospital, Wuerzburg, Germany 2University of Western Australia, Perth, Australia 3Cincinnati Children's Hospital, Cincinatti, OH, USA 4University Hospital, Maastricht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsChorioamnionitis is frequently associated with preterm birth and inflammation in fetal lungs. The fetal lung is immune naive and blood derived monocytes differentiate into alveolar macrophages expressing transcription factor PU.1 late in gestation. Fetal inflammatory responses are minimal to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha in sheep. We hypothesized that chorioamnionitis induced maturational changes in the monocytes of the fetal lung.MethodsTime-mated ewes with singletons received 10mg endotoxin or saline by intra-amniotic injection 2d or 7d before delivery at 124d gestational age (n=7 per group, term 150d). Monocytes/macrophages were isolated with Percoll gradient from the right lung. Monocytes/macrophages were analyzed and cultured with recombinant ovine TNF-alpha (50ng/ml, endotoxin-free).Characterisation of an Anatomically Correct Upper Airway Model in a 32 Weeks Gestational Age Premature InfantS Minocchieri1, J Burren1, M A Bachmann1, P S Huppi3, R Schindel4, J H Wildhaber2, M Nelle11Division of Neonatology, University Children's Hospital, Bern, Switzerland, 2Division of Respiratory Medicine, University Children's Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland, 3Child Development Unit, Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland, 4Institute for Rapid Product Development, University of Applied Sciences, St. Gallen, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsEffective airway passage of aerosols in respiratory therapy of neonates is crucial for a positive outcome. Therefore, devices aimed at delivering aerosols to the lungs such as inhalers and nebulisers must be studied thoroughly. For this purpose we constructed an anatomically correct model of the upper airways in a 32 weeks gestational age premature infant. This study describes the construction process, validation and characterization of this airway model.MethodsThree-dimensional reconstruction of a three-planar MRI scan was done using Magics© software (Materialise™, Munich, Germany) followed by selection of an optimal air-mucosa threshold. Model reconstruction was achieved using the generated data and Selective Laser Sintering Technique. Subsequently, validation was realized between the original data and a CT scan of our model by comparison of airway volume and anatomical reference points.Cardiovascular Monitoring Using Transpulmonary Thermodilution Via Femoral Artery (QTD FEM) During Total Liquid Ventilation (TLV)H Walti1,2, R Robert3, J Lebon2, O Lesur2, J P Praud1,2, P Micheau31Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada, 2Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Sherbrooke, QC, Canada, 3Department of Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering, Sherbrooke, QC, CanadaBackground and AimsAccuracy of QTD FEM, a relatively non-invasive method applicable in a clinical setting, to monitor cardiovascular parameters has not yet been described during TLV.

H2O, Peep=5cm.H2O, FiO2=1.0; TLV=8, whose lungs were filled with 30ml/kg PFOB (F2-chemicals, UK) and then ventilated with volume-controlled-pressure-limited liquid ventilator at Fr=3–4/min, Vt=25ml/kg, I/E=1:3, FiO=1.0. Gas exchanges, Lactate/Pyruvate ratio (L/P) and cardiovascular parameters were recorded at 30 min intervals during a 120 min period.Improving Cpap Delivery Using Heliumoxygen Gas MixturesM Chowdhury1, P Dixon2, P Habibi11Department of Paediatrics, Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine, London, UK 2Viasys Healthcare, London, UKBackground and AimsContinuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) is an established technique for managing acute respiratory failure. Helium-oxygen gas mixtures (heliox), due to its physical properties, may enhance the physiological benefits of CPAP if used as the driving gas. The aim of this study was to assess if heliox can be safely and effectively used as the driving gas through an infant flow driver, one of the commonest CPAP devices in paediatrics.MethodsThe ASL5000 Servo Lung simulator was used to compare heliox/oxygen mixtures versus air/oxygen mixtures as the driving gases of the infant flow driver. Studies were undertaken at 4 different CPAP settings across varying tidal volumes and respiratory rates. In each case pressure, flow and volume changes were measured by the lung simulator. Blender accuracy was noted as well as noise emission.Implications of Disclosure of Positive HIV Status for Mental Health in Zambian AdolescentsN Campain1, A Menon2, M Ngoma3, C Glazebrook11School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK, 2Department of Psychology, University of Zambia, Lusaka, Zambia 3Department of Paediatrics, University Teaching Hospital, Lusaka, Zambia, 4School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nottingham, UKBackground and AimsLittle research has been conducted in developing countries concerning the psychological wellbeing of HIV+ve children.

This is particularly pertinent to the care of children and young people who are dependant on long-term ventilation, as their care may become problematic when it needs to be provided across the geographical and professional boundaries of different care settings. The purpose of this project was to develop a multidisciplinary clinical network between three different but complementary care settings that provided acute and community services to local children with LTV needs. Our aim was to insure the provision of timely, proactive admission to paediatric intensive/high dependency care for these children when they became acutely unwell.MethodsA network between the three sites was established.The networked established the key issues in providing a seamless admission pathway for this group of children and young adults through the three centres were identified over a 5-month period.A collaborative three-centre action plan was then developed in light of the key issues.Current Practice and Management of Cvvh — Setting the Standard in Paediatric Intensive CareJ WhitePICU/Forest Ward, Evelina Children's Hospital, Guy's and St Thomas NHS Trust, London, UKInconsistencies in practice and differing levels of experience dictate that clear standards and guidelines are available for staff when caring for children who require CVVH. These standards and guidelines provide essential support and guidance to both nursing and medical staff whilst caring for children who require this complex intervention. In the early 1990's, a core group of nurses experienced in CVVH, were established. This group continue to lead and manage this challenging service. They are responsible for formulating and guiding practice, and provide support within the multidisciplinary team. Achievements of the group to date include:
Development of a resource booklet? formulation of a competency document.Implementation of an education plan.The booklet includes guidelines based on current best evidence. It provides information on all aspects of CVVH and is utilized by both nurses and doctors when managing the care of children on CVVH. The competency document allows ‘experts’ in the core group to assess nurses caring for children who require and receive CVVH, ensuring competencies are met and standards maintained. Specific CVVH Study Day's and yearly updates form part of the PICU Education Plan to ensure nurses are given time to develop their knowledge and skills in this challenging area. The use of reflection is encouraged throughout this process. Annual National CVVH meetings also help to ensure knowledge and experiences are shared throughout the United Kingdom and provide the opportunity for staff to discuss their experiences and best practice. The initial aims of the group have been achieved and we continue to review practice whilst evaluating the effectiveness of care delivered. The core group and Lead Consultant continue to work collaboratively to meet the educational needs of the nursing and medical staff whilst caring for children who require renal replacement therapy in a safe and consistent environment.Technologically Dependent Child and Infant at HomeM JohanssonPICU, The Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, SwedenAdvances in the care of the critically ill child have reduced mortality but have also introduced a new group of patients in our intensive care units. These patients have a constant need of high technology equipment to stay alive and the treatment will unfortunately at times involve prolonged support for weeks, months, years or even permanently. The required treatment will differ from oxygen inhalation to ventilator support, extensive medication to intravenous infusions, peritoneal dialysis or renal replacement therapy etc. Appropriate care is a challenge as life in hospital is an unsuitable environment for these children as well as an inappropriate use of hospital funding and resources. A transition of care has to take place and the pathway is important for the outcome. To shift the responsibility from hospital professionals toward home care services lies mainly on the neonatologist, paediatrician or health care coordinator. It is important to have a strategy and a well-prepared schedule prior to discharge. Many problems with technical equipment, home environment, staff etc will arise during the process and needs to be taken care of in a professional way. We also need to address emotional, economical and moral issues related to caring for a technology- dependent child at home. By using research, case reports and reflections from parents I will try to enlighten the physiological, psychological as well as the social problems we are facing during our efforts to give a good quality care to the child and family in the home environment.First Experiences with Intrahospital Transfer of Preterm Infants and Sick Newborns on a Omnibed as Transport Inkubator (Monitoring, Ventilator) Without Changing the UnitM Schindler, I Berlett, S Dahlmann, F LoerschUniversity Children's Hospital, Mannheim, GermanyBackground and AimsIn the last few years in our hospital we have to transfer sick newborns from delivery room to NICU in a transport incubator. These transports resulting in significant thermal stress, respiratory and hemodynamic instability. We have developed a novel device to improve thermoneutral environment during this early critical phase, which incorporates an overhead warmer and an incubator. The purpose of this study was to compare the impact of using this device on admission thermal stability.Methods35 newborns were included in this cohort study. Twentyone infants with birth weights of less then 1500g and fourteen sick children (CDH, n=12, CCAM n=2) were transported in a Giraffe OmniBed from delivery room to the NICU. After delivery, the babies were resuscitated in the labor and delivery area using the device in the open bed, radiant warmer mode and then transported in closed bed, incubator mode to the NICU (a distance of approximately 500m).Can a Palliative Care Service Provide an Acceptable Alternative to Intensive Care for Children Facing Inevitable Death?F Craig}1, C Pierce2, D Rajapakse1, A K Anderson11Department of Palliative Care, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK, 2Department of Paediatric Intensive Care, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsBoth palliative care (PC) and intensive care (IC) provide support to children and families facing potential or inevitable death. However the focus of IC is to initiate active treatments, whereas the philosophy of PC is to enable children to achieve an optimal quality of life despite no expectation of cure. The purpose of this study was to determine if families would choose a PC approach over IC when their child faces inevitable death.MethodsReferrals to a PC team were monitored over a 3-year period. The children referred were assessed in 2 groups: those referred to PC before an IC admission and those referred whilst on IC. Place of death was recorded for each child.Critically Ill Children with a Prolonged Stay on the PICU: The Need for Interdisciplinary and Multidisciplinary RoundsP Van Het Einde1, S Naghib1,2, R Groenewegen2, T Tibboel2, K F M Joosten11Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MCChildren's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThere is a group of critically ill children with a prolonged stay on the PICU (&gt; 28 days). They take a lot of PICU resource utilisation. The daily care of these children needs special attention of the nursing staff because the difficulties of dealing with an uncertain prognosis and increasing demands of the children and parents. Objective: Investigating the number of children with a prolonged stay in the last 3 years (2003–2005) in context with the weekly support of the medical and nursing staff.MethodsWe looked if and when a primary nurse was appointed to the children, the number of regular conversations with the parents by doctors together with nurses, the number of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary patient rounds.Co-Bedding Premature Born Multiples: An Evidence-Based ApproachJ M WielengaIC Neonatology, Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsAfter the introduction of developmental care in 2003, professionals as well as parents wished to nurse premature born multiples in one incubator. Co-bedding can be seen as the continuation of the proximity and interaction experienced during the intrauterine period of multiple-gestation infants after birth. It seems reasonably to assume that multiple-gestation infants are born with expectations based on their earlier intrauterine experiences. The transition of multiple-gestation to the extra uterine life can be simplified through stimuli generated by the continuous uninterrupted physical contact. The aim of this project was to study literature and collect information on co-bedding, mainly on the adverse effects of co-bedding. The information collected was used to compose a best-evidence guideline for the new standard of care: co-bedding premature born multiples.MethodsThe study was carried out in the Emma Children s Hospital / Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. We used the method of Critical Appraised Topic (CAT) with the PICO (patientintervention-comparison-outcome) system formulated as: Are multiple borns admitted to the NICU (P) who are co-bedded (I) instead of single-bedded (C) exposed to complication risks or physiological instability (O)? Literature search was performed within PubMed, Cinahl, Embase and the Cochrane Library.Procalcitonin as a Marker for the Early Diagnosis of Neonatal InfectionN Joram1, B Isidor1, V Loubersac2, S Denizot1, G Caillaux1, N Winer3, J C Roze1, C Gras-Le Guen11Département de Périnatologie, CHU Nantes, France, 2Laboratoire de Biochimie, CHU Nantes, France, 3Service de Gynecologie-Obstétrique, Hopital Mère Enfant, CHU Nantes, FranceBackground and AimsMaterno-foetal and nosocomial infections are frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in neonatal intensive care units (NICU). Their prognosis are closely related to early diagnosis and treatment but clinical signs are very poorly specific nor sensitive. In this context, paediatricians frequently initiate early antibiotherapy, exposing non infected newborns to unnecessary treatment. The aim of our work was to evaluate the value of procalcitonin (PCT) as an early and specific marker of perinatal bacterial sepsis.MethodsTwo different studies were conducted. In 197 neonates with suspected materno-foetal infection, serum procalcitonin and C-Reactive Protein concentrations were measured simultaneously in umbilical cord blood and in maternal blood. According to clinical and bacteriological course, three groups were defined: group 1 = infected (n=16); group 2= colonized (n=20); group 3 = non infected and non colonized In 176 preterm neonates (mean 29,8). Hospitalised in neonatal intensive care units more than 48h and with a clinical suspicion of nosocomial infection, PCT was determined immediatly and 24 hours later. Two groups were defined: infected and non infected.Procalcitonin in Paediatric Emergency Departments for the Early Diagnosis of Bacterial Infection in Febrile InfantsA Fernandez LopezSpainBackground and AimsProcalcitonin (PCT) is a potentially useful marker in pediatric Emergency Departments (ED). The basic objectives of this study were to assess the diagnostic performance of PCT for distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections and for the early detection of invasive bacterial infections in febrile children between 1 and 36 months old comparing it with C-reactive protein (CRP) and to evaluate the utility of a qualitative rapid test for PCT in ED.MethodsProspective, observational and multicenter study that included 445 children who were treated for fever in pediatric ED. Quantitative and qualitative plasma values of PCT and CRP were correlated with the final diagnosis. To obtain the qualitative level of PCT the BRAHMS PCT-Q rapid test was used.Distinguishing Between Bacterial and Aseptic Meningitis in the Emergency DepartmentF Dubos1,2, B Korczowski3, D Aygun4, A Martinot2, C Prat5, A Galetto-Lacour6, J Casado-Flores7, F Leclerc2, C Rodrigo5, A Gervaix6, F de la Rocque8, C Levy8, R Cohen8, F Moulin9, G Bréart10, D Gendrel1, M Chalumeau1,101Clinical Epidemiology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Saint Vincent-de-Paul Hospital, Paris, France, 2Jeanne de Flandre Hospital, CHU Lille, France 3Regional Hospital, Rzeszów, Poland, 4Medical Faculty of Firat University, Elazig, Turkey, 5Hospital Universitari Germans Trias I Pujol, Badalona, Spain 6HUG Hôpital des Enfants, Geneva, Switzerland 7Hospital Universitario del Nino Jesus, Madrid, Spain 8Bacterial Meningitis French Surveillance Network, Saint-Maur-des-Faussés, France, 9Department of Emergency Medicine, Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Hospital, Paris, France, 10INSERM U149, FranceBackground and AimsDistinguishing between bacterial meningitis (BM) and aseptic meningitis (AM) in the emergency department (ED) is sometimes difficult, but could be very helpful to avoid unnecessary hospitalisations and antibiotic treatments. Five clinical decision rules combining clinical and biological parameters available at the time of admission were proposed in the literatture. We herein report a research program aiming at identifying the best rule and at improving it, and we discuss future research issues.MethodsData from a retrospective single-center study (n=166 patients, 20 with BM), a secondary analysis of the ACTIV/GPIP French prospective registry of BM in children (n=890), and a retrospective multicenter European cohort study (6 centers in 5 countries, n=198, 96 with BM) were used (1) to compare existing rules and identify the “best” one, (2) to validate the “best” rule on a large population of children with BM, (3) to identify the best biological predictor of BM (serum procalcitonin -PCT- at the time of admission), (4) to validate this predictor, and (5) to combine this new predictor in a new clinical decision rule.Prediction of Vesico-Urethral Reflux After a First Febrile Urinary Tract InfectionS Leroy1,2, C Romanello3, A Galetto-Lacour4, V Smolkin5, B Korczowski6, C Rodrigo7, D Tuerlinckx8, V Gajdos9, M Contardo3, A Gervaix4, R Halevy5, B Duhl6, C Prat7, T Vander Borght8, L Foix-L'Hélias9, G Bréart2, D Gendrel1, M Chalumeau11Clinical Epidemiological Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Saint-Vincent-de-Paul Hospital, Paris, France, 2INSERM U149, Paris, France, 3University of Udine, Italy, 4University Hospital of Geneva, Switzerland, 5Ha'Emek Medical Center, Afula, Israel, 6Regional Hospital N 2, University of Rzeszow, Rzeszow, Poland, 7Germans Trias I Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Spain, 8UCL Mont-Godinne, Yvoir, Belgium 9Antoine-Béclère Hospital, Clamart, FranceBackground and AimsFebrile urinary tract infection (FUTI) reveals vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) in 20-40% of children. Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) is then recommended systematically, but is painful, expensive, exposes to radiation and is a posteriori normal in 60–80% of cases. Then, selective approaches for VCUG are needed. We herein report various strategies proposed to achieve this goal, and discuss future research issues.MethodsA retrospective single-center cohort study (n=136, including 25% patients with VUR), and a secondary analysis of 8 prospective European cohort studies (n=398, including 25% patients with VUR) were performed, and included consecutive patients aged 1 month to 4 years with a first FUTI. The data were used to evaluate the reproducibility of the clinical decision rule proposed by Oostenbrink et al [Acta Pediatr, 2000] aiming at predicting VUR using a risk score combining clinical (family history of uropathology, male gender, young age), biological (elevated C-reactive protein) and radiological (urinary tract dilation on renal ultrasound) variables. Then, we identified and validated a new predictor of VUR: a high serum procalcitonin (PCT) level at the time of diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.Genetics in SepsisJ A HazelzetPICU, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsSepsis is a polygenic and complex syndrome that is initiated by infection and is characterized by a host response which consist of a systemic inflammatory response. This host response can be quite different between individuals. Genetic polymorphisms in this immune response to infection can partly explain these differences and have been shown to be associated with clinical outcomes. Functional and association studies involving genetic polymorphisms in essential genes. These include specific and aspecific recognition of pathogen associated microbial patterns, signaling receptors like Toll-like receptors, primary and secondary inflammatory proteins like cytokines and chemokines, and coagulation and fibrinolysis factors These polymorphisms have provided important insights into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. The advancement of high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping will provide valuable information on the interaction of multiple allelic variants and clinical outcome. More precise categorization of patients based on genetic background is likely to lead to individualized targeted treatment. A specific example of pediatric sepsis is the meningococcal sepsis. The clinical presentation of infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis is highly diverse. Some patients develop meningitis, and others present with sepsis or even septic shock. Genetic differences might explain this diversity. Genetic polymorphisms among components of the host response have been shown to be involved in the susceptibility, severity, and outcome of meningococcal disease.MethodsLiterature search and own findings.Immune Depression in Post SepsisJ A CarcilloDepartment of Critical Care Medicine and Pediatrics, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA, USABackground and AimsNosocomial sepsis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill neonates and children. This lecture will describe the elements of CRitical Illness Stress-induced Immune Suppression (CRISIS) as a cause of nosocomial sepsis.MethodsImmune phenotyping and immune modulation findings from our center, as well as an evidenced based review of basic and clinical literature on this topic, will be presented.Hemodynamic Changes During Hemofiltration in Meningococcal SepticaemiaP Maheshwari, R Chhabra, M Clement, C DeMunterPICU, St Mary's Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsThere is good theoretical background for the treatment of severe sepsis with haemofiltration. The aim was to review the cardiovascular effects of veno-venous haemofiltration in severe meningococcal septic shock.MethodsAll patients with severe meningococcal sepsis who were hemofiltered in our paediatric intensive care unit were included in the study. Parameters including inotropic requirement, metabolic acidosis, fluid requirement and blood lactate were recorded 12 hours before starting hemofiltration, at the time of starting, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours after initiating hemofiltration.The Influence of Etomidate on Adrenal Function in Children with Meningococcal SepsisM den Brinker1, A C Hokken-Koelega3, J A Hazelzet2, F H De Jong4, W C Hop5, K F Joosten21Department of Pediatrics, 2Department of Pediatrics, Division of Paediatric Intensive Care, 3Department of Pediatrics, Division of Endocrinology, 4Department of Internal Medicine, 5Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsTo investigate the influence of one single bolus of etomidate used for intubation on adrenal function in children with meningococcal sepsis.MethodsRetrospective study of 60 children admitted between 1997 and 2004 to the PICU with meningococcal sepsis, not treated with steroids. Adrenal hormone concentrations were determined as soon as possible after PICU admission, 12 and 24 hours thereafter. To assess disease severity, PRISM score and selected laboratory parameters were determined.Lipopolysaccharide-Binding Protein in Critically Ill Children with Suspected Infection: Comparison with Lipopolysaccharide, Soluble Cd14, Procalcitonin, and C-Reactive ProteinM Pavcnik-Arnol1, S Hojker2, M Derganc11Department of Paediatric Surgery and Intensive Care, 2Department of Nuclear Medicine, University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, SloveniaBackground and AimsTo evaluate markers of infection in critically ill children, comparing lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), soluble CD14 (sCD14), procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP).MethodsProspective observational study in the level III multidisciplinary paediatric intensive care unit. Forty-nine children with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and suspected infection were classified into two groups: SIRS — sepsis (n = 30) and SIRS — no sepsis (n = 19). The median age was 2.4 years. The disease severity was high (mean PRISM III score= 16.5). Serum concentrations of LBP, LPS, sCD14, PCT and CRP were measured on two consecutive days. Area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and predictive values were evaluated. Correlations between markers of infection were examined.Viral Laryngotracheitis (Croup Syndrome) is Significantly Associated with Severe Sepsis and Septic ShockR M Basciani1,2, D C Bachmann1, I Bolt1, B P Wagner11Department of Paediatrics, University of Berne (Inselspital), 2Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Berne (Inselspital), SwitzerlandBackground and AimsCroup syndrome is a common diagnosis in paediatrics with a benign, self-limited course. Only patients with inspiratory stridor at rest and respiratory distress are hospitalized and about 1% require intubation. However, bacterial tracheitis, pneumonia, and sepsis can complicate croup syndrome and significantly increase morbidity and mortality. Beside the “classical” respiratory problems there is little awareness about these potentially life-threatening complications among paediatricians. This study aims to provide data about the incidence and prognosis of sepsis in croup-patients.MethodsIn this observational single centre study all children admitted to our 16-beds, tertiary level paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) due to severe croup syndrome were retrieved from the prospective database.Clinical Spectrum of Severe Imported Malaria in ChildrenP Tissieres, V Haas, L Chevret, S Essouri, C Perrot, D Devictor, P DurandMultidisciplinary Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Hôital de Bicêtre, Le Kremlin-Bicêtre, FranceBackground and AimsTo characterize clinical spectrum of severe imported malaria in children living in non-endemic region.MethodsRetrospective study of all children admitted in a single tertiary pediatric ICU over a 15 years period. Severe imported malaria was considered if severe malaria met 2001 WHO criteria and occurred in children after returning from a travel in endemic region.Mechanisms of Vascular Degeneration in Retinopathy of Prematurity: O2 And Co2S Chemtob, E Kermorvan, F Sennlaub, D Checchin, M Beauchamp, S Brault, C Quiniou, M Sirinyan, P Hardy, M BalazyDepartments of Pediatrics, Ophthalmology and Pharmacology, Hôpital Ste. Justine, Research Centre, Montreal, QC, CanadaRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is characterized by a phase of arrest in vascular development associated with vasoobliteration, which is followed by an ischemic phase resulting in neovascularization. Major factors involved in vascular degeneration include a suppression in VEGF expression combined with a rise in reactive oxygen species and corresponding peroxidation products. On one hand, ischemia-induced retinal (rather than preretinal) neovascularization can be considered beneficial in salvaging the tissue. Yet, despite production of angiogenic factors and nitric oxide within ischemic tissues, compensatory ingrowth of new vessels fails to provide adequate vascularization. Thus, we hypothesized that local factors counter efficient revascularization via nitrosative stress related pathways. Along with hypoxia, ischemia also produces a concomitant elevation of CO2. In the developing subject, hypercapnia has been associated with the development of ROP in humans and confirmed experimentally. However, the significance of hypercapnia, particularly on neovascularization, has been relatively overlooked compared to the numerous studies on hypoxia. We investigated the mechanisms by which hypercapnia impair vascular development. We found that acute and prolonged CO2 exposures inhibit developmental neovascularization of the retinal vasculature, as well as revascularization of the ischemic retina. This was associated with increased eNOS, generation of highly reactive nitrogen species (including peroxynitrite) and downregulation of the pro-survival and angiogenic PGE2 receptor, EP3; VEGF and its receptors were not affected. NOS inhibitors as well as peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTPPS prevented hypercapnia-induced vasoattenuation. Furthermore, we illustrate that in vitro CO2 results in a NO-dependent microvascular endothelial cell (EC) protein nitration and cell death. Mediators of nitrosative stress remain for the most part unknown. Trans-arachidonic acids (TAAs) are recently described major products of NO2′ radicalmediated isomerization of arachidonic acid, and their formation is enhanced by high CO2 levels; we explored if and how TAAs reproduce biological effects of nitrosative stress. TAAs are generated in our model of retinal microangiopathy in vivo in a NO-dependent manner. TAAs induced a selective time- and concentration-dependent cell death of ECs in vitro, and resulted in retinal microvascular degeneration ex and in vivo. These effects are mediated by an upregulation of the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), independently of classic arachidonic acid metabolism; accordingly, TAA-induced vasoobliteration was prevented by selective neutralizing antibodies to TSP-1 as well as to its receptor CD-36. In summary, our findings uncover previously undescribed mechanisms of 64 — hypercapnia-induced cytotoxicity, specifically as it pertains to nitrosative stress in microvascular injury, and provide insight into therapeutic avenues in the management of disorders involving nitrosative stress such as ischemic retinopathies and possibly encephalopathies commonly encountered in the immature subject. Finally, the dogma regarding safety of hypercapnia may need to be revisited.Prevention of Retinopathy of PrematurityA Sola, A Schenkman, L Skolinck, M R RogidoMid Atlantic Neonatology Associates, Morristown Memorial Hospital, Morristown, NJ, USABackground and AimsOxygen was discovered more than 200 years ago and it has been administered to more infants in the world than any other neonatal treatment. However, we still do not fully know how much is wise to give or how much infants actually need in relation to variations in illness and gestational and postnatal age. “Too much oxygen” damages the retina and now we know that it increases risk for serious illnesses like cancer. In many places, and even in the recent literature, there is a debate about using 21% O2 versus 100% or ‘pure’ oxygen during resuscitation. This practice cannot be a correct practice for many infants, since it excludes or limits a more reasonable practice, a practice based on using an ‘adequate’ dose of oxygen (anywhere from 21% to 100%), assessing each infant's needs with an accurate pulse oximeter, targeting for an “acceptable” SpO2 and using a blender to be able to administer the needed oxygen dose for that target. Measuring FiO2 and O2 saturation accurately with a state of the art monitor which incorporates new technologies can today be done routinely from the time of birth in preterm infants treated through out the world. ROP is the most common cause of blindness but many cases can be prevented by practicing differently.MethodsI will review in some detail how much we know and do not know about oxygenation, alveolar gas equation, normal PaO2 and O2 saturation when breathing room air and when breathing oxygen. I will also review pulse oximetry in neonatal medicine, including the most important aspects of SpO2 and the significant differences in saturation monitors in the market. I will review our peer reviewed publications in relation to prevention of ROP and oxygenation and some related publications by other investigators.Effect of Acute Hypoxia and Reoxygenation with Room Air or Different Oxygen Concentrations on Urinary Markers of Oxidative StressR Solberg1, Y Andresen1, R Escrig2, I Izquierdo2, P Saenz2, M A Asensi3, J Sastre3, M Vento2, O D Saugstad11Department of Pediatric Research, Rikshospitalet, Oslo, Norway, 2Servicio de Neonatologia, Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain, 3Departamento de Fisiologia, Universidad de Valencia, SpainBackground and AimsOxidative stress associated with reoxygenation may be responsible for short and long-term pathological consequences. Our aim was to study the effect of acute hypoxia and reoxygenation with room air or 40%, 60% or 100% oxygen upon urinary markers of oxidative stress, which could be a useful non-invasive tool for monitoring patients in the clinical setting.MethodsPiglets were asphyxiated following a standardized model, and resuscitated with 21%, 40%, 60% or 100% oxygen. Once recovered and stabilized, piglets were sacrificed. Urine samples were collected. 8- oxo-DHG and 2DG as well as ortotyrosine and phenylalanine were determined by mass spectrometry.Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Gene Polymorphism and Serum Concentration as Risk Factors of Retinopathy of PrematurityP Kwinta1, M Bik-Multanowski1, Z Mitkowska1, T Tomasik1, J Kobylarz2, J J Pietrzyk11Department of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland, 2Department of Ophthalmology, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, PolandBackground and AimsRecent experimental studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) can play an important role in the development of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The aim of the study was analysis of: (1) correlation between serum concentration of VEGF during the first month of life and the risk of ROP (2) association of T (-460C) and G (+405C) polymorphisms of VEGF gene with ROP.Methods128 newborns with mean birthweight 1073g were included into prospective study. Concentrations of VEGF were measured by Elisa assay in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th weeks of life. Molecular studies of VEGF polymorphisms were performed with PCR-RFLP and RG-PCR. The infants were divided into 2 groups: A) no ROP or ROP not requiring treatment (n=92) and 2) ROP requiring lasertherapy (n=36).Levels of (Spo2) Between 85% and 93% Are Associated With Normoxemia In Newborns (Nb) Receiving Oxygen Therapy (Fio2&gt;21%) in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (Nicu)A Castillo1, H Baquero3, F Neira3, R Deulofeut1, A Sola11Department of Neonatology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA, 2Mid Atlantic Neonatology, Morristown, NJ, USA, 3Universidad del Norte, Barranquilla, ColombiaBackground and AimsNB breathing room air (RA) have normal SpO2 of 95–100% but keeping SpO2 95–100% in NB breathing FiO2&gt;21% can cause hyperoxia. In 2003, we described that SpO2 85–95% is associated with less morbidity. There is concern that these SpO2 levels may cause persistent or intermittent hypoxemia. Objective: to evaluate PaO2 at different SpO2 levels in NB with arterial catheters.MethodsProspective comparison of PaO2 and SpO2 in stable NB in 4 NICU's of 2 countries. PaO2 obtained for clinical indications; simultaneous SpO2 was recorded at the time of the arterial gas. Comparisons were made only in stable NB if the SpO2 changed &lt;1% before, during and after the collection of the sample. Statistics: Chi square, Fishers, bivariate and multivariate analysis.Glutathione Redox Status at Birth Predicts Oxygen Needs in the Extremely Preterm InfantsR Escrig1, I Izquierdo1, P Saenz1, J Sastre2, J Vina2, M Vento11Servicio de Neonatologia, Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Spain, 2Departamento de Fisiologia, Universidad de Valencia, SpainBackground and AimsAntioxidant enyzme expression matures in the last weeks of gestation. Thus, extremely preterm infants are prone to reactive oxygen derived lung injury. However, prenatal corticosteroids (PCTS) improve postnatal adaptation in these infants. We hypothesize that PCTS favor glutathione cycle enzyme maturation and expression thus reducing alveolar damage.MethodsPremature infants &lt;28 wks gestation receiving (CORT; n=15) and not receiving NOCORT; n=12) antenatal glucocorticoids were enrolled. In cord blood samples and venous blood at 7 d postnatally total erythrocyte GSH and GSSG, as well as GPx and GReductase activities were determined by methods previously described (Vento M el al JPediatr 2003). Supplemental oxygen given was registered along the study.Incidence And Severity of Retinopathy of Prematurity (Rop) is Reduced In Extremely Low Gestational Age (Ga) Newborns (Elgans) Treated With Recombinant Human Cu/Zn Superoxide Dismutase (Rhsod)R B Parad1,2,4, E Allred2,3,4, J Davis5,6, N American rhSOD Study Group61Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, MA, USA 2Department of Pediatrics, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA, 3Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, USA, 4Childrens Hospital, Boston, MA, USA, 5Department of Pediatrics, Winthrop University Hospital, Mineola, NY, USA, 6SUNY Stony Brook Medical School, Stony Brook, NY, USABackground and AimsROP is a two-phase disease in which effects of hyperoxia, hypoxia and reactive O2 species (ROS) lead to abnormal retinal vascularization, particularly in ELGANS. We hypothesized that the highest risk ELGANS (&lt;25wks) might benefit most (largest effect size) from rhSOD reduction of ROS. Effects on the smallest ELGANS may have been obscured by the total cohort analysis performed in the last rhSOD (Ferring) trial (for the prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in infants under 1250g (Pediatrics, 111:469, 2003)).MethodsIn that trial, 302 infants were randomized to intratracheal (IT) rhSOD or placebo at birth and every 48h while intubated.Microcirculatory Analysis Using Sidestream Dark Field (Sdf) Imaging in SepsisC InceDepartment of Physiology, Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsSublingual OPS (orthogonal polarization spectral) imaging has revealed the central role of the microcirculation in the pathophysiology, outcome and treatment of sepsis by its ability to visualise the microcirculation in great detail under clinical conditions. Of particular importance in this context has been the response of the smallest microvessels, the capillaries. OPS imaging illuminates the tissues with polarized green light and measures the reflected light from the tissue surface after filtering out the polarized portion of the reflected light. A clinical scoring system was developed to quantify images in septic patients (1). However OPS imaging was found to lacks sensitivity to study in detail capillary kinetics and morphology. We recently introduced SDF (Sidestream Dark Field) imaging as a new way of clinical observation of the microcirculation. In this modality a light guide imaging the microcirculation is surrounded by light emitting diodes (LED) of a wavelength (530nm) absorbed by the hemoglobin of erythrocytes so that they can be clearly observed as flowing cells. Covered by a disposable cap the probe is placed on tissue surfaces. The light from the concentrically placed LED's at the tip of the probe directly penetrate deep into the tissue illuminating the microcirculation. By not being in direct optical contact with the sensing central core of the probe no direct surface reflections interfere with the image of the microcirculation and remarkable clear images can be observed. The deeper sublingual arterioles as well as the glcocalyx lining of the endothelial cells can also be clearly observed. Improved image quality allows better computer automatic analysis of the images and the low energy requirement of SDF imaging further enhances its utility by allowing battery and/or portable computer operation. It is expected that SDF imaging will provide an improved imaging modality of the microcirculation in sepsis especially in pediatriatic patients 1.

Recent data implicate a critical function for hemoglobin and the erythrocyte in regulating the activity of NO in the vascular compartment. Intravascular hemolysis releases hemoglobin from the red blood cell into plasma (plasma cell-free plasma Hemoglobin), which is then able to scavenge endothelial derived NO 600-fold faster than erythrocytic hemoglobin, thereby disrupting NO homoestasis. This may lead to vasoconstriction, decreased blood flow, platelet activation, increased endothelin-1 expression (ET-1), and end-organ injury, and thus suggesting a novel mechanism of disease for hereditary and acquired hemolytic conditions such as sickle cell disease and cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition to providing an NO scavenging role in the physiological regulation of NO-dependent vasodilation, hemoglobin and the erythrocyte may deliver NO as the hemoglobin deoxygenates. While this process has previously been ascribed to S-nitrosated hemoglobin, recent data from our laboratories suggest that deoxygenated hemoglobin reduces nitrite to NO and vasodilates the human circulation along the physiological oxygen gradient. This newly described role of hemoglobin as a nitrite reductase is discussed in the context of blood flow regulation, oxygen sensing, and nitrite-based therapeutics.

Spatially resolved near-infrared spectroscopy is suitable, but accuracy is insufficient (1). Our aim was to quantify the precision of the cerebral Tissue Oxygenation Index (c-TOI) doing repeated measurements to see if imprecision could explain the lack of accuracy.MethodsTwenty-five mature and 37 premature infants were examined using the NIRO300 oximeter (Hamamatsu). The handheld optode was re-sited in different parieto-temporal positions three to nine times within 20 minutes. One-way ANOVA was used to estimate variability.Role of Reactive Oxygen Species in Kv Channel Inhibition and Vasoconstriction Induced by tp Receptor Activation in Rat Pulmonary ArteriesA L Cogolludo1,2, G Frazziano2, L Cobeñ2, L Moreno2, F Lodi2, J Tamargo2, F Perez-Vizcaino2, E Villamor11Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Maastricht, Research Institute Growth and Development (GROW), Maastricht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutnese, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsVoltage-gated potassium channels (Kv) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) have been involved in several forms of human and experimental pulmonary hypertension. We have reported that the TXA2 analog U46619, via activation of TP receptors and PKCz, inhibited Kv currents in rat pulmonary artery (PA) smooth muscle cells, increased cytosolic calcium and induced a contractile response in isolated rat and piglet PA. Herein, we have analyzed the role of reactive oxygen species in the signalling pathway.MethodsU46619-evoked changes in contractility, dichlorofluorescein fluorescence (an indicator of intracellular hydrogen peroxide), and Kv currents (using the whole-cell configuration of the patch clamp technique) were analyzed in adult rat PA.Microvascular Flow is Compromised Early in Neonatal InfectionI Alba-Alejandre1, S Hiedl1, F Christ2, O Genzel-Boroviczeny11Division of Neonatology, University Children's Hospital, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany, 2Department of Anaesthesiology, Klinikum Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, GermanyBackground and AimsThe early diagnosis of neonatal infection remains a challenge. Recent studies using Optical Polarizated Spectral (OPS) imaging techniques, have reported microcirculatory alterations in adult patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The objective of this study was to compare microcirculatory flow and vascular density between healthy (H) and sick newborns (I) with neonatal infection.MethodsWe obtained prospectively OPS images from the ear conch of 45 infants on their 1st, 2nd and 3rd day of life. Infection was defined as IL-6&gt;50pg/mL and CRP&gt;0,5 mg/dL. The OPS sequences were analyzed off-line, blinded to clinical status of the infant, using a semiquantitative assessment of flow based on the work of De Backer and Boerma.Neonates Born to Mothers with Preeclampsia (Pe) Exhibit Altered Microvascular FunctionM J Stark1, V L Clifton1, I M R Wright1,21Mother and Babies Research Centre, Hunter Medical Research Institute, University of Newcastle, NSW, Australia, 2Kaleidoscope Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, John Hunter Children's Hospital, Newcastle, NSW, AustraliaBackground and AimsThere is abnormal peripheral microvascular function in Pre-eclampsia (PE). We have shown that fetal sex alters maternal microvascular function. It is known that males dominate the poor outcomes in PE (20). We hypothesised that neonatal microvascular function would be altered following PE and be further influenced by sex.MethodsPeripheral microvascular responses were examined using Laser Doppler flowmetry. Term control infants (n=31) and infants of PE mothers (n=33) where studied at 6 hours and days 1, 3, and 5–7. Baseline perfusion and vasodilatory response to local thermal stimulation and post-occlusive reperfusion were measured.First Assessment of the Microcirculation in Critically Ill Children by Orthogonal Polarisation Spectral (Ops) ImagingP C Top1, J E Van Velzen1, K R Mathura2, C Ince2, D Tibboel11Department of Pediatric Surgical Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, 2Department of Physiology, AMC, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsA prominent feature of sepsis is dysfunction of the microcirculation, with impaired perfusion and regional tissue oxygenation. Orthogonal Polarisation Spectral imaging (OPS imaging) is a noninvasive technique that has recently been developed for the study of the microcirculation of mucous membranes and the surface of solid organs. In adults this technique has been proven valuable to predict organ failure and mortality. The aim was to evaluate the feasibility of OPS imaging in children and to determine baseline data of the microcirculation and to evaluate microcirculation in critically ill children.MethodsThe microvascular network of the oral mucosa was studied. The effect of temperature, blood pressure, hemoglobin concentration and pH were studied. Baseline data were determined.How Best Can We Care for the Dying Infant or Child and Their Family?F Lynch1,2, A Van den Hoogen31Paedatric Intensive Care Unit, Evelina Children's Hospital, London, United Kngdom, 2President of Scientific Committee ESPNIC Nursing, 3Department of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Childrens Hospital, Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThis interactive session aims to discuss and explore the roles and responsibilities of the PICU and NICU nurse in caring for the dying child or infant and their family. This important aspect of nursing care challenges even the most experienced nurse. We will share our experiences and generate ideas about best practice through facilitation of audience participation.MethodsThe experience of caring for the dying infant or child in the critical care setting is one which challenges the multidisciplinary team greatly. At a time of immense emotional distress, it is essential that the nurse provides timely, compassionate and therapeutic care for the patient and their family. Insensitive, unhelpful and misguided care can have a lasting negative impact on the grieving process for the family. It is therefore essential that we provide the best care we can to support the family during this difficult time.Parental Choice in Place of Death: Guidelines for Terminal Extubation Outside PICUA P Anderson, F CraigGreat Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsTo develop guidelines for terminal extubation outside PICU.MethodsRetrospective case review of four children whose families have requested terminal extubation to occur outside PICU. Key aspects of care were identified along with difficulties encountered. Based on this experience comprehensive guidelines were developed.End-of-Life Care in Pediatric Intensive Care: A Priority for Pediatric NursesH Pereth1, F Martens1, D Danschutter1, J Ramet2, L Deliens3, J Bilsen3, S Hachimi-Idrissi11Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium, 2Department of Pediatrics, Koningin Paola Ziekenhuis, Antwerp, Belgium, 3Faculty of Medicine and Pharmacy Medical Sociology, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, BelgiumBackground and AimsCare of children at the end of life involves ethical dilemmas and difficult decisions. Empirical research on these decisions focuses predominantly on the physicians’ role. Little is known about the role of the pediatric nurses. This paper reports the findings of a study that evaluates the attitude of nurses regarding end-of-life decisions in children. The study also reports their involvement in the decision-making process and their participation in the accomplishment of the decision.MethodsAnonymous questionnaire was send to nurses working in 5 different pediatric intensive care settings, in Belgium.A Parent to Parent Support Program for Mothers of Preterm Infants in the NICU: a Randomized TrialT del Moral1, L Falcon1, A Rodriguez{1, A Bernacet1, J Wilkinson2, S Fajardo-Hiriart1, R Echeverri11Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami, FL, USA, 2Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Miami, FL, USABackground and AimsAn individual peer support network could be an effective intervention to help parents deal with the stress of having a baby in the NICU. This study aims to assess the stress of parents while their infants are in the NICU and to evaluate the effectiveness, in alleviating stress, of a parent to parent support program.MethodsMothers of infants with a birth weight &lt; 1500g were randomized to a control or an intervention group. Those in the intervention group were paired with volunteer parents who had previously had a premature infant. These volunteers were trained according to the Parent Partners Listener Training Program (George Washington University). Both groups answered the NICU Family Needs Inventory (NFNI) and the Parental Stressor Scale (PSS) during the first and sixth weeks after admission to NICU. Outcome data were analyzed in an intention to treat basis using T-test.Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis: Time for Vaccination!F Gimenez-SanchezAdvisory Committee of Vaccines, Spanish Association of Pediatrics, Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Torrecardenas Hospital, Almería, SpainPlease refer to page 119a.Rotateq®: Ensure Successful VaccinationP HeatonMerck Research Laboratories, USAPlease refer to page 119a.Thinking Forward with MMRV VaccineM KnufGermanyAbstract not available at the time of printing.ProQuad®: Meeting with Challenge of New Measles, Mumps, Rubella and Varicella VaccineB KuterUSAAbstract not available at the time of printing.Infectious Diseases and Host ResponseR de GrootThe NetherlandsAbstract not available at the time of printing.Mucosal Immunology: Neonatal Adaptation of the Major First Line Defence SystemP BrandtzaegLaboratory for Immunohistochemistry and Immunopathology (LIIPAT), Institute of Pathology, University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, NorwayThe vast majority of immunological challenges confronting the body make contact with mucosal surfaces, including infectious agents and foreign proteins. To maintain homeostasis in the extensive and vulnerable mucosae, they are protected by specialized mechanisms of immune protection. Numerous genes are involved in the regulation of both innate (natural) and adaptive (acquired) immunity, with a variety of modifications introduced over million of years. Two-layered adaptive mucosal immunity: In the process of evolution, the mucosal immune system has generated two layers of non-inflammatory defence: (i) immune exclusion performed by secretory IgA antibodies to modulate or inhibit surface colonization of microorganisms and dampen penetration of potentially dangerous soluble factors; and (ii) suppressive mechanisms to avoid local and peripheral hypersensitivity to innocuous antigens, particularly food proteins and components of commensal bacteria. When induced via the gut, the latter phenomenon is called ‘oral tolerance’, which appears be a rather robust adaptive immune function in view of the fact that large amounts of food proteins pass through the gut, while overt and persistent food allergy is not so common. Neonatal immune adaptation: The neonatal period is particularly critical, both with regard to infections and priming for allergic disease. This is so because the mucosal barrier function and the immunoregulatory network are poorly developed for a variable period after birth, and successful neonatal immune adaptation to exogenous stimuli is crucial to health. Notably, mucosal homeostasis depends on appropriate microbial colonization as well as adequate timing and dose of foreign food proteins when first introduced in the diet. Dendritic cells are ‘decision makers’ in the immune system when they perform their antigen-presenting function, thus linking innate and adaptive immunity by sensing the exogenous impact (e.g. conserved microbial molecular patterns) on the mucosa. A balanced indigenous microbiota is apparently required to drive the normal development of both mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and the secretory IgA system as well as mucosally induced tolerance mechanisms such as the generation of regulatory T cells. Moreover, the properties of dendritic cells also appear to be influenced by dietary factors such as vitamin A. Other dietary factors including lipids, particularly the polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids in fish oil, can likewise in several ways have a beneficial effect on the developing immunophenotype of the infant. The same is true for breast milk, which provides both immunoregulatory factors and secretory antibodies reinforcing the infant's mucosal barrier.Mechanism of Allergic Sensitization: the Hygiene HypothesisE IsolauriDepartment of Paediatrics, University of Turku, FinlandBackground and AimsThe hygiene hypothesis conceives the increase in atopic disease to be related to reduced exposure to microbes early in life.MethodsThe Nutrition, Allergy, Mucosal Immunology and Intestinal Microbiota (NAMI) research group has evaluated the host-microbe interaction in performing studies on:
The Association: Mode of delivery-gut microbiota-risk of atopic disease.Clinical Intervention: Probiotics in nutritional management/ risk reduction of atopic disease.Mechanisms: Probiotic / microbiota effects / Pathogenesis of disease.Change in Nursing Practice Starts with You!W De Groot-BolluijtGrootBolwerk, Maasdijk, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsNursing is an innovative and dynamic profession. Since the early days of Florence Nightingale, nursing practice has changed dramatically in order to provide better care and improve the outcome of the patient's illness. The latest development in nursing is the change towards evidence based practice. Knowing the newest developments does not seem to be sufficient for making a change effective. Providing knowledge by education, training and symposia does often not have the required results. Change Management gives realization in different aspects necessary for implementing an innovation. The aim of this workshop is to present the Change Work Model to obtain practical skills for a successful implementation of innovations.MethodsThe Change Work Model is based on concepts of various theories of change management and learning styles. In addition, unit culture and innovation techniques are also incorporated in this model. The assumptions of the concepts within the Change Work Model are based on the available literature and are connected within a framework in the set up of the Change Work Model. The model is based on the assumption that before implementing an innovation, nurses have to know the different aspects of change. How they experience there own role and learning styles, the culture of there working place and what they expect from innovation. After the explanation of the theory, the participants will work with checklists based on the different aspects with examples from daily practice. The Change Work Model will lead nurses to become aware of their own role and learning styles, recognise the impact of the organization's culture and to identify recommendations to implement change.A Parent Telephone Support Network for the Intensive Care UnitA M Scales1, P L Shroff1, C M Pierce21Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK, 2Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsThe need for family support in intensive care unit is well documented (1). Parents have always offered uniquely understanding support in shared situations. They have an altruistic desire to help others or’ give back’ into the setting which has had enormous impact on their family. In partnership with professionals, parents can use this compassion and experience, if trained and supported properly, to help other families. In line with government Patient and Public Involvement Strategies and feedback from our intensive care family group a Parent Telephone Support Network (PTSN) was developed and supported by hospital trust management. The aim of the service is to provide unique support for anyone directly affected by an admission to intensive care. Using this to complement the multidisciplinary psychosocial support already offered, thus enhancing the wider support mechanisms available for families.MethodsFifteen parents/carers participated in initial training sessions consisting of simulated phone calls, useful skills and helpful strategies to provide confidence in providing this support.Parent Stress and Concerns for Children After Cardiac SurgeryL S Franck1,2, A McQuillan2, N Power1,2, A Goldman1,21Institute of Child Health, London, UK, 2Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsThe hospitalisation of a child in intensive care is known to be a stressful experience for parents that may affect family functioning. However, little is known about the time course and the relationships between parental stress and the child's actual or expected recovery. This research project was conducted to investigate pre- and post-operative parental stress and to examine the influencing factors during the postoperative period.MethodsAn exploratory, descriptive study was undertaken, using triangulation of methods, to explore parental stress, expectations and perceptions regarding their child's recovery from cardiac surgery. Structured interviews were conducted with the parents of 117 children pre-operatively and on days 1, 3, 5, 8 and 15 postoperatively (whilst child still in hospital). Parents independently completed a validated parent stressor scales.The Fetal Origins of Insulin Resistance and the Metabolic SyndromeC Lévy-MarchalINSERM U690, Robert Debré Hospital, Paris, FranceOver the past fifteen years, a large body of studies has evidenced the relation between SGA (small for gestational age) and the increased risk of insulin-resistance, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases later in life. The first reports focused on elderly and in populations where the prevalence of diabetes is already high. The association with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome was later extended to young adults and to prepubertal children. Our research programme is based on a large community-based cohort where all subjects were carefully selected on birth data and gathers 734 SGA subjects (birth weight &lt; 10th percentile) and 886 AGA (adapted for gestational age) subjects (25 &lt; BW &lt;75 perc.) born 1971–85. In these adults born SGA, we have reported a number of malfunctions of the adipose tissue persisting after puberty (22 yr. old) suggesting an abnormal adipose tissue which could participate to insulin-resistance and the metabolic syndrome : — They show an excess of fat mass, preferentially abdominal, without obesity — Insulin action on lipolysis is reduced and FFA release is not suppressed under physiological insulin concentrations — An excessive lipolysis in response to catecholamines was observed by microdialysis of the abdominal adipose tissue — Leptin levels show an impaired regulation during catch-up and are low in adults — Adiponectin levels are low and the and insulin-sensitizing action is impaired. — Pro12Ala of PPAR actually enhances IR in the SGA individuals whereas it shows a insulin-sensitizing effect in AGA's, attesting for a real interaction with the fetal environment. and this observation has been replicated in two independent cohorts At the same time the different features of MS (hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance) were manifested in these SGA subjects and were clustering around IR. However, the phenotype was mild meaning that the differences between the subjects born SGA and their pairs born adapted for gestational age (AGA) were indeed significant for all features but of low magnitude. As a matter of fact, the proportion of disorders of glucose tolerance was low but twice as high in SGA in comparison to AGA (3.8% vs 1.6%) and that of MS six fold higher (2.3% vs 0.4%). We hypothesize that the adipose tissue, which is a major target of fetal growth restriction, is a key-tissue responsible for the metabolic complications and that the process extends beyond the perinatal period and continues to evolve in adults.Controlled Trial of Early Low-Dose Hydrocortisone Treatment in Prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Preterm Infants: A Two-year Follow-UpO M Peltoniemi, A Lano, K Nikolajev, M A Kari, M HallmanDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, FinlandBackground and AimsDexamethasone treatment is associated with increased the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) among VLBW infants. Early hydrocortisone (HC) treatment may decrease the incidence of BPD, but no follow up studies have been published so far. Here we present the first preliminary results.Methods51 infants enrolled in a blinded, controlled trial evaluating the effectiveness of postnatal early HC treatment in prevention of BPD were reviewed. According to present results the infants who had low cortisol values before the supplementation had less severe respiratory course and lower incidence of BPD; however, the infant with high endogenous cortisol had no benefit (J Pediatrics 2005). Here we report the results of physical growth and neurodevelopmental outcome at corrected age of two years.Intravenous Endotoxin Results in Pulmonary Inflammation and Lung Remodeling in Preterm Fetal SheepB W Kramer1,2, C P Speer2, A B Coumans2, T H Hasaart2, Y Garnier21University Children's Hospital, Wuerzburg, Germany 2University Hospital, Maastricht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsChorioamnionitis and fetal systemic inflammation are associated with a reduction in respiratory distress syndrome but an increase in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD has been associated with an impaired lung development marked by a rearrangement of elastin deposition. We hypothesized that elastin was part of the structural changes induced by inflammation after intravenous E.coli endotoxin injection into fetal sheep.MethodsFetal sheep were chronically instrumented at 107d gestational age and delivered at 117d (term 147d). The control group (n=6) received saline injection and the study group (n=7) 100ng endotoxin intravenously. Lung tissues were stained for nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB for proinflammatory gene transcription, for surfactant protein B (SP-B) for maturation and for elastin for structural remodeling. Staining intensity was analyzed in a four step semi-quantative scale.Increased Arterial Blood Pressure and Arterial Stiffness in Young Adults Who were Born PrematureC Grosse1, L Tauzin1, P Rossi2, M Tsimaratos3, U Simeoni11Division of Neonatology, Assistance Publique, Hopitaux de Marseille and Faculte de Medecine, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France 2Division of Internal Medicine, Assistance Publique, Hopitaux de Marseille and Faculte de Medecine, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, France 3Pediatric Nephrology Unit, Assistance Publique, Hopitaux de Marseille and Faculte de Medecine, Universite de la Mediterranee, Marseille, FranceBackground and AimsRecent studies have shown that low birth weight infants are at risk of increased arterial blood pressure (ABP) in adulthood. Previous works from our centre and others suggest that ABP and arterial stiffness (AS) are increased in adolescents who were born preterm. Study aims were to characterize AS and ABP in young adults who were born preterm with an appropriate birth weight for gestational age compared to a control group born at term with an appropriate birth weight.MethodsSystemic ABP was measured with an automated oscillometric device. AS was estimated by pulse wave velocity (PWV) between carotid and radial arteries. Increased PWV was considered to correspond to increased AS.Methylation Profiles of IGF2, H19 and PEG1/MEST Genes: Epigenetics and Fetal Origins of Adult DiseasesC Buffat1, H Jammes2, J M Dupont2, L Fayol1, M Gamerre3, J Tost4, I G Gut4, D Vaiman2, U Simeoni11Université de la Méditerranée, Faculté de Médecine and Service de Néonatologie, Hôital de la Conception, Marseille, France, 2INSERM U709, Hôital Cochin, Paris, France, 3Service de Gynécologie-Obstétrique, Hôpital de la Conception, Marseille, France, 4Centre National de Génotypage, Evry, FranceBackground and AimsLow birth weight is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension and type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Mechanisms are incompletely known. DNA methylation may be a common link underlying the association between adverse fetal growth and elevated risk of later chronic diseases. We aimed at determining the methylation profiles of IGF2, H19 (epigenetically deregulated domains in Beckwith-Wiedeman syndrome) and PEG1/MEST DMRs (Differentially Methylated Regions) in placental tissues of pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and uncomplicated pregnancies.MethodsPlacental villi samples and maternal peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from IUGR pregnancies and controls (n = 17, n = 30, respectively), after informed consent. Protocols for the study were approved by the institutional Ethics Committee. Bisulfite conversion and pyrosequencing technology were used to characterize individual specific methylation profiles in the IGF2, H19 and PEG1/MEST DMRs.Altered Hypoxic Response in Newborn Mice with Targeted Deletion of the Tachykinin 1 GeneJ Berner1, Y Shvarev1,3, H Lagercrantz1, A Bilkei-Gorzo2, T Höfelt1, R Wickströ11Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Department of Molecular Neurobiology, University Hospital Bonn, Germany, 3Neurogenomic Laboratory, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Novosibirsk, RussiaBackground and AimsIn this study, we used mice, with targeted deletion of the tachykinin 1 (TAC1 -/-) gene, lacking neurokinin A (NKA) and substance P (SP). Especially SP is known to be involved in respiratory rhythm and pattern generating mechanisms.MethodsWe employed in vivo and in vitro approaches to study hypoxic response and changes in chemosensitivity in knock-out mice vs. wild type (WT). In vivo, the effects of intermittent hypoxia (IH) and moderate hypercapnia, were studied using whole-body flow plethysmoraphy at postnatal days 2–3 and 8–10. In vitro, anoxic responses, as well as the effects of hypocapnic and hypercapnic conditions were investigated in brainstem-spinal cord preparation at postnatal day 2.Early Systemic Hypotension (ESH) and Vasopressor Support (VPS) in Low Birth Weight Infants (LBWI): Impact on NeurodevelopmentM C Bravo1, F Cabañs1, S Salas1, R Madero2, J Quero1, A Pellicer11Dept of Neonatology, 2Biostatistic Unit, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsCerebral circulation is pressure-passive in LBWI with ESH who receive VPS (Pellicer et al, Pediatrics 2005). VPS is controversial as was associated with severe periventricular hemorrhage (PVH). There is no prospective information on VPS and morbidity. Objectives: Prospective study to evaluate the influence of ESH and VPS on neurodevelopment.MethodsLBWI with ESH (&lt;24h of life) (group S) were assigned randomly to receive dopamine (2.5–10 µg/kg/ min) or epinephrine (0.125–0.5 µg/kg/ min) in stepwise manner until target blood pressure was attained (treatment success, subgroup TS). Controls (C) were patients without ESH who had parental consent. Outcome measures: cerebral ultrasound (CUS) up to 40 wk, structured neurological evaluation (every 3 months) and neurodevelopmental test at 2–3 years.The Impact of Intrauterine Growth, Prematurity and Environment on Cognitive Function in very Preterm and very Low Birthweight Infants in Young AdulthoodN Weisglas-Kuperus1,4, E T M Hille1,2, H J Duivenvoorden3, J B van Goudoever1, S P Verloove-Vanhorick21Dept of Pediatrics, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, 2TNO, Quality of Life, Leiden 3Dept of Medical Psychology and Psychotherapy, NIHES, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 4On Behalf of The Dutch POPS-19 Collaborative Study GroupBackground and AimsInfants born very preterm or with low very low birthweight are at increased risk of cognitive deficits. Follow-up data into young adulthood however are scarce. We examined the impact of prematurity, intrauterine growth, and environment on cognitive function in young adults born very preterm or with very low birthweight.MethodsA cohort of 562 (59%) infants born in the Netherlands in 1983 (POPS study) before 32 weeks of gestation and/or with birthweight less than 1,500 gram had cognitive assessment at age 19 years.Interleukin-1Beta, Interleukin-18 and Interferon-Gamma Expression in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Preterm Infants With Posthemorrhagic Hydrocephalus — Markers of White Matter Damage?A Heep1, T Schmitz2, F Groenendaal3, P Bartmann1, M Obladen2, U Felderhoff-Mueser21Dept of Neonatology, Friedrich Wilhelms University of Bonn, 2Dept of Neonatology, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Charité — Universitäsmedizin Berlin, Germany 3Dept of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsTo investigate the impact of perinatal brain injury associated with cystic white matter damage (WMD) on the developing preterm brain, we analyzed biomarkers specific for inflammatory responses in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of preterm infants who develop post hemorrhagic hydrocephalus (PHHC).Methods22 preterm infants with PHHC undergoing serial reservoir puncture were included in the study. Patients were grouped according to the diagnosis of signs of cystic WMD on ultrasound at day 28 postnatal age (pna). Group A: 9 infants with PHHC without signs of cystic WMD (median gestational age 27+5 weeks). Group B: 13 infants with PHHC and cystic WMD (median gestational age 27+3 weeks). Samples were analyzed at first ventriculostomy (median day 26 pna). 16 age-matched preterm infants with lumbar puncture for the exclusion of meningitis served as controls. CSF concentrations of IL-1beta, IL-18 and IFN-gamma were analysed using ELISA.Newly Emerging Viral InfectionsA D M E OsterhausDepartment of Virology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsIn the past century, pandemic outbreaks of influenza and AIDS have cost the lives of tens of millions of people. These events were all caused by multiple introductions of animal viruses — influenza A viruses and SIV of birds and non-human primates respectively — into the human population. Besides these introductions causing major pandemics in humans, a large number of other virus infections have spilled over from animal reservoirs to humans or other susceptible species, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality as ‘virgin soil’ epidemics. The most recent examples in humans are the introduction of SARS coronavirus and influenza A viruses (H5N1 and H7N7) from the animal world, which caused global concern about their potential to be at the origin of new pandemics. Over the last decades there seems to be a dramatic increase in the emergence or reemergence of virus threats in humans and animals worldwide. A long list of exotic names like Ebola, Lassa, Rift-Valley, Crimea-Congo, Hendra, Nipah and West-Nile is the illustration of names of just some of the places associated with the origin of viruses that crossed the species boundary to humans, with dramatic consequences in the last ten years alone. Similarly, recent mass mortalities among wild aquatic and terrestrial mammals caused by previously known and newly discovered morbiliviruses, as well as outbreaks of hog cholera, foot-and-mouth disease and fowl plague among domestic animals, highlight this trend. Although improved detection and surveillance techniques, as well as increased media attention may have contributed to our perception of an increase in the incidence of outbreaks of virus infections, it is becoming more and more clear that major changes in our modern society increasingly create new opportunities for virus infections to emerge: a complex mix of changes in social environments, medical and agricultural technologies and ecosystems continues to create new niches for viruses to cross species boundaries and to rapidly adapt to new species. In combating this global threat, we should make optimal use of the new tools provided by the unprecedented advances made in the research areas of virology, molecular biology, immunology, epidemiology, genomics and bioinformatics. Serious investment in these areas in the future will not only be highly cost-effective but will also save many lives of humans and animals. In addition, better collaboration and coordination between all the stakeholders is urgently needed, to establish early warning systems and effective preparedness plans.Urogenital Symptoms During Pregnancy and Birth Weight: The Generation R StudyL Duijts1,2, V W V Jaddoe1,2,3, A Hofman1,3, H A Moll1,21The Generation R Study Group, Erasmus MC — Sophia's Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2Department of Paediatrics, Erasmus MC — Sophia's Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 3Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Erasmus MC — Sophia's Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsPhysician-diagnosed urogenital tract infections in pregnancy are associated with low birth weight and premature birth. The aims of this study were to assess the association of subjective urogenital complaints in different trimesters of pregnancy with birth weight and gestational age.MethodsThis study was embedded in the Generation R Study, a population-based prospective cohort study from fetal life until adulthood in Rotterdam, The Netherlands (2002–2006). Urogenital complaints were assessed by questionnaires in each trimester in pregnant women. Complaints were categorized in mild urethral complaints, mild vaginal complaints and more severe complaints (bleeding after sexual intercourse, nonpainful ulceration, enlarged lymph nodes in the groin). Birth outcomes were obtained from midwife and hospital registries. The present analysis was based on 6,680 prenatally included women with complete records.Incidence and Non-Nutritional Risk Factors for Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) in Very Low Birthweight Infants (VLBWI)L Gagliardi1, M De Curtis2, R Bellù31Division of Pediatrics and Neonatology, Ospedale Versilia, and Italian Neonatal Network, Lido di Camaiore, Italy, 2University La Sapienza, Rome, Italy 3Division of Neonatology, Ospedale A Manzoni, Lecco, and Italian Neonatal Network, Lecco, ItalyBackground and AimsTo estimate incidence and non-nutritional risk factors for NEC.MethodsAnalysis of a cohort of 2135 VLBWI infants, born in Lombardy (Italy) in 1999–2002 and admitted to 14 Intensive Care Units, participating to the Network Neonatale Lombardo. Mean GA was 29.3 weeks; mean birthweight was 1101 g. Definitions of the Vermont-Oxford network, including NEC definition, were used. Logistic models (adjusting for GA, congenital anomalies, birthweight &lt; 10 centile, twinning, 1-minute Apgar, sex, type of delivery, location of birth) were used to estimate and test the association of factors with NEC.Mitochondrial Haplotype H: Body Temperature and Sepsis in Very Low Birth Weight InfantsW Göpel1, C Härtel1, J Spiegler1, E Kattner2, H Küster3, J Möller4, D Müller5, W Nikischin6, H Segerer7, C Wieg8, A Wense9, B Roth10, E Herting11Department of Pediatrics, University of Lübeck, Germany, 2Kinderkrankenhaus auf der Bult, Hannover, Germany, 3Department of Pediatrics, Greifswald University, Germany, 4Department of Pediatrics, Saarbrücken Hospital, Germany, 5Department of Pediatrics, Hospital of Kassel, Germany, 6Department of Pediatrics, Christian Albrecht University, Kiel, Germany, 7Kinderklinik St. Hedwig, Regensburg, Germany, 8Department of Pediatrics, Aschaffenburg Hospital, Germany, 9Altonaer Kinderkrankenhaus, Hamburg, Germany, 10Department of Pediatrics, University of Köln, GermanyBackground and AimsMitochondrial haplotype H is common in European populations and associated with improved survival and higher core temperatures in adults with gram-negative sepsis (Baudouin et al.

Biofilm production has a central role in pathogenesis. PIA, encoded by the icaADBC locus, is the main component of biofilms. We previously demonstrated that ethanol enhances S. epidermidis biofilm production. Bacteriostatic 0.9% NaCl, water and heparin sodium solution used in hospitals, contain 0.9% −1% benzyl alcohol as preservative. We hypothesized that benzyl alcoholcontaining solutions can enhance biofilm formation in S. epidermidis.MethodsWe studied 10 S. epidermidis strains obtained from blood cultures of infants and hands of nurses in neonatal intensive care unit. All strains had the same PFGE pattern and contained icaADBC locus. Biofilm production was quantified using microtiter plate assay in plain media and media supplemented with bacteriostatic 0.9%NaCl, water or heparin sodium solution containing benzyl alcohol, as well as with the same solutions without benzyl alcohol (controls).Nosocomial Infections in Small for Gestational Age Newborns with Birthweight &lt;1500G: a Multicenter AnalysisD B Bartels1, F Schwab2, O Dammann1,3, C Geffers2, S Baerwolff2, P Gastmeier2,41Departments of Obstetrics and Pediatrics, Hannover Medical School, Germany, 2Institute of Hygiene, Charité-University Medicine in Berlin, Germany, 3Neuroepidemiology Unit, Departments of Neurology, Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA, 4Institute of Medical Microbiology and Hospital Epidemiology, Hannover Medical School, GermanyBackground and AimsSmall for gestational age (SGA) infants with very low birthweight (VLBW, &lt;1500g) are at increased mortality risk in comparison to their appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA) peers, while effects on their morbidity are less clear. The aim of this multicenter analysis was to investigate whether SGA-neonates are at increased risk of nosocomial infections (NI).MethodsThe German national surveillance system for NIs in NICUs includes data from VLBW infants admitted to one of 47 large NICUs. Data from n=6681 infants, born 2000–2004, were available. Growth retardation was defined as birthweight &lt;10th percentile, AGA as birthweight between the 10th and 90th percentile. Outcome variables were nosocomial sepsis, pneumonia, and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Univariable data analyses, logistic.Hyperglycaemic Episodes (He) As an Early Marker of Sepsis in Premature Infants Less Than 30 Weeks Gestation and Less Than 1000G Birthweight (Elbw)J R Fernandez Alvarez, T Dygas, P Amess, H RabeTrevor Mann Baby Unit, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, East Sussex, UKBackground and AimsEarly diagnosis of sepsis in preterms is difficult. Platelet count and CRP are specific, but late markers of sepsis. IL-6/IL-8 are sensitive, but expensive early markers. ELBW newborns have 18 times more HE than those &gt;2000g. The aim was to investigate the use of HE in the early diagnosis of sepsis in ELBW newborns.MethodsRetrospective analysis of data from ELBW newborns with &gt;-1 HE (&gt;144mg/dl) was performed. Onset, duration and frequency of HE, glucose intake, medication and glucose values before, during and after HE were recorded. Frequency of sepsis (pos. blood culture, and/or CRP &gt;10mg/l and/or thrombocytopaenia &lt;150000/microliter) and temporal relation to HE were recorded. Results are given as median.New Dosage Schedule for Continuousinfusion Vancomycin Therapy in Preterm Neonates with Suspected Gram-Positive InfectionsO Plan1, G Cambonie1, C Milesi1, O Defez2, M Pidoux1, C Badr1, E Sabatier1, B Veit-Sauca1, J C Picaud11Department of Neonatology, University Hospital, Montpellier, France, 2Department of Statistics, University Hospital, Montpellier, FranceBackground and AimsA constant infusion rate over 24h results in a better bactericidal efficacy of vancomycin since it's action is time-dependent. Proposed dosage schedules (Palowtsky 1998, Borderon 1994) are complex leadind to low serum vancomycin concentrations and unconstant bacteriological efficiency (personal data). We evaluated a new simplified dosage schedule based on body weight and serum creatinine.MethodsProspective data collection during routine use of vancomycin in premature neonates. In case of suspected septicemia gram-positive infections blood was collected for culture and creatinine measurement before antibiotic administration. Starting vancomycin dosage was 25 or 15 mg/kg/d during the first period and 30 or 20 mg/kg/d during the second period whether serum creatinine was below or above 90µmol/L, regardless of gestational or postconceptional age. Then blood sampling was performed 48h after the initiation of treatment (blood culture, serum vancomycin). Required therapeutic range was 10–25mg/L.Amylin Peptide Levels are Raised in Newborns with Feed IntoleranceV Kairamkonda1, A Deorukhkar2, R Coombs2, R Fraser3, T Mayer41Department of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, Leicestershire, UK2Department of Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, Trent, UK3Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Sheffield, Trent, UK4Department of Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Sheffield Children's Hospital, Sheffield, Trent, UKBackground and AimsAmylin is a novel 37 amino acid peptide that is co-secreted with insulin from the pancreas in response to food intake. As a potent inhibitor of gastric motility it plays an important role in the control of carbohydrate absorption by regulating the efflux from the stomach to the small bowel. Feed intolerance results in prolonged parenteral fluid therapy, increased hospital stay, increased risk of sepsis and consequently increased cost of treatment. We hypothesized that amylin levels may be raised in newborns with feed intolerance. We aimed to determine the relationship between amylin levels and gastric emptying in newborns with feed intolerance.MethodsBlood from a serial sample of 16 infants greater than 24 weeks gestation was analysed for amylin levels. Feed intolerance was defined as gastric residual volume of greater than 50% of previous 4 hour feed volume on two consecutive occasions. Eight infants were classified as feed-intolerant (nTOL) and 8 as feedtolerant (TOL).Effects of Iugr and Postnatal Catchup Growth on Arterial Blood Pressure, Glucose Tolerance and Renal Function in Aged RatsF Boubred1,2, C Buffat2, J M Feurstein2, L Daniel3, M Tsimaratos2, C Oliver2, U Simeoni1,21Department of Neonatology, Hospital University La Concepcion, Marseille, France, 2Faculty of Medecine, UPRES EA 2193, Marseille, France, 3Department of Histopathology, Faculty of Medicine, Marseille, France 4Laboratory of Biology, Les Cordeliers INSERM U356, Paris, FranceBackground and AimsLow birth weight is associated with increased risk of arterial hypertension and metabolic diseases in adulthood. Rapid postnatal growth may constitute an additional risk. AIM: to investigate the effects of postnatal overfeeding (OF) after IUGR in aged rats.Methods4 groups of animals were investigated: group I, controls; group II, offspring of dams fed low protein diet (LP, caseine 9%);group III, postnatal OF (reduction of litter size); group IV, LP rats exposed to postnatal OF. Glomerular number, SBP, intra-peritoneal glucose test, and renal function (GFR) were evaluated at different ages up to 22 months.Continuous Feeding Promotes Gastrointestinal Tolerance and Growth in Very Low Birth Weight InfantsA L Dsilna1, K Christensson1, L Alfredsson2, H Lagercrantz3, M Blennow41Division of Reproductive and Perinatal Health Care, Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Institute of Environmental Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 3Division of Neonatal Research Unit, Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 4Department of Clinical Sciences, Karolinska Institutet, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsGastrointestinal intolerance is a well known problem among very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants. Parenteral nutrition during long periods is therefore needed, which increase the risk for both delayed growth and morbity. Previous studies has shown that feeding given as a slow rate infusion enhances duodenal motor function and decrease energy expenditure when compared to bolus feeding. The aim of the study was to compare the effects of continuous versus intermittent feeding on gastrointestinal tolerance and growth in VLBW-infants.MethodsIn a randomized, controlled trial conducted at three neonatal units, seventy premature infants, with a gestational age 24–29 weeks and birth weights &lt; 1200 grams, were assigned to one of three feeding methods: 1. Continuous nasogastric feeding, 2. Intermittent nasogastric feeding or 3. Intermittent orogastric feeding. Feeding was initiated within 30 hours of birth. Daily enteral and parenteral volumes, caloric and protein intakes, growth, enteral intolerance and clinical complications were collected. Cox regression analysis was used to determine primary outcome, the time to achieve full enteral feeding.Effects of Amino Acid Administration on Albumin Fractional Synthesis Rates in Premature Neonates on Postnatal Day TwoC H P Van Den Akker1, F W J Te Braake1, H Schierbeek2, T Rietveld3, J B Van Goudoever11Department of Paediatrics, Division of Neonatology,, 2Department of Paediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, 3Department of Internal Medicine, Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsRecently, we demonstrated that administration of parenteral amino acids (AA) immediately after birth to premature infants is safe and results in positive nitrogen balances via increased protein synthesis. Apart from whole body effects, we wanted to determine organ specific effects of early AA administration. Albumin is an organ specific parameter produced in the liver and often found to be in low concentrations in premature infants. We hypothesised that the fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of albumin increases in premature infants if AA are administered immediately following birth. The FSR represents the fraction that is renewed per unit of time.MethodsPremature infants (&lt;1500 g) received the first two postnatal days either solely glucose (control group, n=5) or glucose and AA (intervention group, n=6). On the second day of life, both groups received a primed continuous infusion of [1–13C] leucine and blood was sampled after 5 and 6 hours. Albumin was extracted from the plasma, hydrolyzed, derivatized, and leucine isotopomers were subsequently measured with a gas chromatography — combustion — isotope ratio mass spectrometer (GC-C-IRMS). Plasma alphaketoisocaproate was measured by GC-MS and used as an intracellular leucine precursor.Is Cyst(E)Ine an Essential Amino Acid in Two-Month-Old Very Low Birth Weight Preterm Infants?M A Riedijk1, G Voortman2, R H van Beek3, J B van Goudoever11Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, 2Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Internal Medicine, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, 3Department of Pediatrics, Amphia Hospital, Breda, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsCyst(e)ine is a non-essential amino acid in adult humans. It can be synthesized from methionine by transsulfuration and this is regulated through the enzyme cystathionase. Cyst(e)ine is considered as a conditionally essential amino acid in preterm infants due to low cystathionase activity. However, the cyst(e)ine requirement in infants is not defined. Aim is to determine the cyst(e)ine requirement in preterm infants with a gestational age of 26 to 29 weeks at the age of 35 to 37 weeks by use of indicator amino acid oxidation (IAAO) technique.MethodsTwenty-five preterm infants (gestational age 28.1 wk ± 1.2 wk SD, BW 1.05 kg ± 0.21 kg SD) who tolerated full enteral feeding, were randomly assigned to one of the graded cyst(e)ine test diets (11, 22, 32, 43, 65 mg cyst(e)ine/100 ml formula). After 24 hours of adaptation, cyst(e)ine requirement was determined by using [1–13C]phenylalanine hydroxylation. 13CO2 release from [1–13C]phenylalanine was measured by isotopic ratio mass spectrometry and linear regression was used to calculate the cyst(e)ine requirement.Are Prebiotics Effective in Reducing the Level of Neonatal Hyperbilirubinemia?M Bisceglia1, A Belcastro1, V A Poerio1, U P Corapi1, F Indrio2, R Francavilla2, F Raimondi3, R Paludetto31Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Crotone Hospital, Crotone, Italy, 2Department of Pediatrics, University of Bari, Italy, 3Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University of Naples ‘Federico II’, Naples, ItalyBackground and AimsTo examine whether supplementing formula with oligosaccharide mixture may modulate bilirubin total (BT) levels in formula fed infants during the first weeks of life by modification of intestinal microflora.Methods76 full-term infants were double blind randomly allocated into two groups to receive either supplementation of oligosacharides (GOS/FOS ratio 9:1, 0.8 g/100ml (n=37) or maltodexrine (n=39), from birth. BT (TcB) level was determined by multiwavelength spectral analysis, (BiliCheck) within 2 hours after birth (T0), 24hs (T2), 72 hs (T4) and at completed 28 (T8) days of life. Capillary hematocrit (Ht) was further determined.What Formula Should We Propose for Very Low Birth Weight Infants after Discharge from Hospital: Preterm Formula or Standard Term Formula?J C Picaud1, 2, O Plan1, O Pidoux1, B Reygrobellet3, F Chapuis4, E Lachambre5, L D Van Egroo5, B L Salle3, O Claris31Dept of Neonatology, Arnaud de Villeneuve Hospital, University of Montpellier, France, 2Human Nutrition Research Center of Lyon, University of Lyon, France, 3Dept of Neonatology, Edouard Herriot Hospital, University of Lyon, France, 4Dept of Methodology and Statistics, University of Lyon, France, 5Nestle France, Noisiel, FranceBackground and AimsAs there are still no proposed guidelines about post-discharge nutrition, we evaluated growth and whole-body mineralization in VLBW infants fed preterm (PF) or term (TF) formula.MethodsDouble-blind randomized study in preterm infants randomized at discharge (T0) to be fed PF or TF. Subjects were fed PF or TF until one month after theoretical term (T1). Then, all subjects received TF until 3 months after theoretical term (T2). Anthropometric data and whole-body Dual-energy Xray Absorptiometry were assessed at T0, T1 and T2. Statistical differences between the 2 feeding groups assessed using t-test or Mann-Whitney.Randomised Cross-Over Study: Effect of Two Different Fortifiers on the Incidence of Metabolic Acidosis in Preterm InfantsN Rochow1, A Redlich1, H Küster1, F Jochum2, C Fusch11Dept of Neonatology, University Children’s Hospital, Greifswald, Germany, 2Department of Pediatrics, Ev. Waldkrankenhaus Spandau, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsBreast milk fed preterm neonates need to be fortified to achieve adequate weight gain. The composition of the available fortifiers differs and has a potential influence on acid load. Since the introduction of a new commercially available human milk fortifier in our neonatal unit we observed an increased incidence of metabolic acidosis. Therefore, we compared the effect of two different fortifiers on the development of metabolic acidosis and weight gain.MethodsPreterm infants on &gt;100ml/kg oral feeds with mothers milk only were randomised and supplemented with fortifiers. Clinical and laboratory parameters were collected using a standardised protocol. In case of acidosis (BE&lt;-6mmol/L) the other fortifier was fed after recovery of the metabolic status.Is Intrapartum Asphyxia Preventable? At What Cost?J C Becher, B J Stenson, A J LyonDepartment of Neonatology, Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, ScotlandBackground and AimsRecent evidence suggests that asphyxia-related perinatal mortality and morbidity (ARMM) are declining. We wished to examine local delivery unit trends in ARMM and operative deliveries between 1994–2005.MethodsRecords of all full-term inborn admissions were retrospectively reviewed for the diagnosis of ‘hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy’ (HIE) and related diagnoses. Accuracy of diagnosis was verified. Threeyear moving averages of HIE, full-term intrapartum stillbirths, delivery room asphyxial neonatal deaths, and full-term operative deliveries were calculated and trends analysed with the Chi-square test.Stillbirths And Survival At 22–31 Weeks of Gestational Age: A Populationbased Study in ItalyM Cuttini1, M Da Frè2, V Carnielli3, F Macagno4, D Di Lallo5, E Buiatti61Pediatric Hospital Bambino Gesù, Rome (Lazio), Italy2Regional Health Agency, Firenze (Toscana), Italy3G. Salesi Hospital, Ancona (Marche), Italy, 4Civile Hospital, Udine (Friuli Venezia Giulia), Italy, 5Agency for Public Health, Roma (Lazio), Italy, 6Regional Health Agency, Firenze (Toscana), ItalyBackground and AimsValid estimation of preterm infants’ survival to discharge requires studies of geographically defined populations.MethodsAs part of a larger research project on Very Preterm Pregnancies and Births (ACTION), an areabased study was carried out including all births and late terminations of pregnancies occurred in 2003-2004 in four Italian regions: Friuli Venezia Giulia, Toscana, Lazio and Marche. Data on maternal characteristics, pregnancy and, for liveborn, admission to Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) were collected.Acute Effects of Surgical Ligation of Patent Ductus Arteriosus (Pda) on Cerebral Oxygenation and Blood Volume in Very Low Birth Weight InfantsB M Hüning1, B Asfour2, S Köig1, N Hess1, C Roll31Department of Pediatrics and Pediatric Neurology, University Children’s Hospital, Essen, Germany2Department of Pediatric Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery, German Pediatric Heart Institute, Sankt Augustin, Germany, 3Department of Neonatology, Children’s Hospital Datteln, University of Witten Herdecke, Witten, GermanyBackground and AimsDopplersonography has shown a sharp increase in diastolic blood flow velocity in cerebral arteries following PDA closure. Using nearinfrared spectroscopy (NIRS) we aimed to assess acute effects of surgical closure on cerebral oxygenation and cerebral blood volume (CBV).MethodsTen preterm infants, birth weight 590 – 1070 g (median 748 g), gestational age 23 – 27 wks (median 24 wks) were studied during surgery (day 12 – 22 of life; median 14). Using NIRS, changes in concentrations of cerebral oxygenated and deoxygenated haemoglobin were measured, and changes in CBV and cerebral oxygenation were calculated. Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation (pulse oxymetry), tcPO2, tcPCO2, and blood pressure were registered simultaneously.Deep Hypothermia in the Treatment of Neonatal Asphyxia: Preliminary DataG Cristofori, P Mussini, C Bottura, E Agazzani, R Astolfi, G CompagnoniNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, ‘Carlo Poma’ Hospital, Mantua, ItalyBackground and AimsBenefits and safety of mildmoderate hypothermia (34–35,5 C and 33–34,5 C respectively) to treat perinatal asphyxia are documented. In animal studies, neuroprotective effect seems to be proportional to the depth of hypothermia but with more side effects. The aim of this study is to determine the safety of hypothermia to 30–33 C in term asphyxiated infants. Mortality, major neurologic abnormalities and major RMI cerebral lesions are described, comparing these results with historical controls.MethodsTerm infants admitted for perinatal asphyxia were enrolled within 6 hours after birth and treated with hypothermia (rectal temperatures around 30–33 C) for 72 hours. Neurological abnormalities and RMI cerebral lesions were evaluated.Non-Invasive Measurement of Reduced Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio and Shunt in Infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia; a Physiological Definition of the DiseaseD Quine1, B J Stenson1, C M Wong1, E M Boyle1, J G Jones21Department of Neonatal, Simpson Centre for Reproductive Health, Edinburgh, UK, 2Department of Medicine, University of Cambridge, UKBackground and AimsAn objective definition of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is required to interpret trial outcomes and provide a baseline for prognostic studies. Reduced ventilation/perfusion ratio (VA/Q) and increased right to left shunt can be determined non-invasively by plotting oxygen saturation (SpO2) against inspired oxygen pressure (PIO2). Reduced VA/Q causes a right shift of the SpO2 against PIO2 curve. We describe the reduced VA/Q and shunt in infants with BPD.Methods21 preterm infants with BPD were studied at 36 weeks CGA. PIO2 was varied in steps to cause SpO2 to vary between 86-94%. Pairs of SpO2 and PIO2 values were plotted and analysed to derive reduced VA/Q and shunt.Preterm Birth &lt;25 Weeks — Costs and Consequences. An Australian Regional StudyN P French1,2, R Hagan1, J McMichael1,2, H Benninger11Women’s and Children’s Health Service, King Edward and Princess Margaret Hospitals, Perth, WA, Australia2State Child Development Centre, Perth, WA, AustraliaBackground and AimsControversy continues regarding initiation of life supporting measures in infants born before 25 weeks gestation, with wide variations between units and between different countries. In Western Australia (WA) a long standing permissive approach to the support of these infants and centralisation of perinatal services has allowed us to examine resource use and long term outcome in a regional study of this small group in relation to the wider picture of perinatal care. Aims: 1. To demonstrate trends in survival &lt;25 weeks since 1992. 2. To examine resource use in WA, (hospital days, respiratory support days, estimated dollar costs) 3. To assess frequency and severity of disability from 1992–2002.MethodsOverlapping cohorts were analysed for Survival (1992–2004, n=378), Resource use (2002–2004, n=69 of all 5,713 neonatal admissions), and Outcome (1992-2002, n=151). Severe disability was defined as nonambulant cerebral palsy (CP), or DQ/IQ &gt; 3sd below mean, or blind.Parenting Stress, Quality of Mother Infant Interaction and Maternal Responsiveness in Very Premature Twin and Singleton BirthsC Glazebrook1, C Sheard1, S Johnson2, A Whitelaw3, C Israel3, N Marlow21School of Community Health Sciences, University of Nottingham, UK, 2Divsion of Child Health, University of Nottingham, UK, 3Department of Clinical Science at North Bristol, University of Bristol, UKBackground and AimsThe quality of mother-infant interaction is important for very premature (VP) infants who are at risk for cognitive delay. This study aims to investigate the impact of a very premature twin birth on parenting stress, maternal responsiveness and quality of mother-infant interaction.MethodsMothers of 17 VP twins (&lt;32 weeks gestation), drawn from a parenting intervention study, formed the study sample. The target twin was chosen at random. Each mother was matched for age, educational attainment and parity with a singleton mother. At 3 months corrected age mothers were videotaped whilst attempting to teach their infant a developmentally appropriate task. Videos were rated using The Nursing Child Assessment Teaching Scale (NCATS) to assess the quality of both caregiver and infant interactions. The responsivity subscale of the HOME was also administered and mothers completed the short-form Parenting Stress Index.Combined Therapy with Phenobarbital and Delayed Posthypoxic-Ischemic Hypothermia: Dissociation of Functional Benefit From NeuropathologyJ D Barks1, Y Q Liu1, F S Silverstein1 21Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, 2Department of Neurology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USABackground and AimsWe previously demonstrated that treatment with the Topiramate immediately after unilateral cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in neonatal rats extended the therapeutic window of post-HI hypothermic neuroprotection, in terms of both function and neuropathology. To begin to address whether this effect of Topiramate is generalizable to other anticonvulsants, we tested phenobarbital (PB) in a similar paradigm.MethodsP7 rats underwent right carotid ligation followed by 90 min in 8% O2. Fifteen min after HI, rats received PB 40 mg/kg (n=12) or saline vehicle (n=11). Beginning 3 hr after HI all rats underwent 3 hr hypothermia (HT) in a 27 C incubator. One wk later lateral vibrissae stimulated forepaw placing was evaluated in 10 trials/side, followed by quantitation of ipsilateral damage severity [%left-right difference = 100*(L-R)/L] in cortex, striatum and hippocampus.New Trends in the Management of Neonatal Brain InjuryM ThoresenDepartment of Clinical Sciences, St. Michael’s Hospital, Bristol, UKPerinatal asphyxial encephalopathy remains an important complication in newborn infants occurring in 1–2/1000 births in Europe and is associated with a high risk of death or major neurological and neurodevelopmental abnormalities in survivors. Experimental and clinical studies show that following asphyxia, multiple inter-related pathophysiological processes that culminate in necrotic and apoptotic cell death occur over a prolonged period. Experimentally, hypothermia ameliorates these processes and reduces the severity of cerebral injury. Recently completed trials of treatment with moderate induced hypothermia following perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy confirm that clinically significant improvement in outcome is possible. When hypothermia will be used as standard treatment for all infants with severe asphyxia we are faced with several questions. Which early entry criteria do we use? How do we cool? Is head cooling or total body cooling best? Should this intervention only be applied in level III units or is there also a place for treatment in local hospitals? Temperature management after brain injury is important, in particular avoiding rebound hyperthermia which easily occurs when circulation is restored. Number needed to treat was 6 in the 2 large clinical trials published in 20051,2 meaning that 5 out of 6 children treated did not have an effect of hypothermic treatment. Are there more options? Adding additional drugs to hypothermia? There are recent experimental studies suggesting a variety of drugs that might add to the neuroprotection and these will be reviewed.17B-Estradiol and Phytoestrogens Protect Against Oxygen-Induced Cell Death in Developing OligodendrocytesB Gerstner1,2, N Sucher1, U Felderhoff-Mueser2, M Obladen2, J J Volpe1, P A Rosenberg11Department of Neurology, Children’s Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, USA, 2Department of Neonatology, Children’s Hospital Charit’e, Humboldt University, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsIn the developing human brain, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is the predominant white matter injury underlying the development of cerebral palsy. Our group recently showed that short exposure to high oxygen levels can trigger apoptosis in immature, but not in mature oligodendrocytes (OLs) in vitro. 17ß-estradiol (E2) plays an important role in the development and function of the CNS. The sudden drop in circulating estrogen after birth may aggravate the susceptibility to oxidative stress in premature infants. We examined the effect of E2, and phytoestrogens on hyperoxia-induced cell death in immature rat OLs.MethodsPrimary OL cultures were subjected to 80%O2 in the presence or absence of estrogen (10-6–10-10M). LDH assay was used to assess cell viability. OL maturation status and caspase-3 activation were studied by immunochemistry. Immunoblot analysis was used to quantify ER expression, and demonstrated an upregulation of ER-α after E2-pretreatment.Fas Signalling in the Neonatal Rat Brain Following Exposure to OxygenM Dzietko1, V Boos1, O Polley1, S Endesfelder2, M Sifringer2, K Genz1, C Bührer3, M Obladen1, U Felderhoff-Müser11Department of Neonatology, Children’s Hospital, Charit’e Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany2Department of Pediatric Neurology, Children’s Hospital, Carl Gustav Carus University, Dresden, Germany, 3Department of Neonatology, Universitäts-Kinderspital Beider Basel, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsAdvances in neonatal medicine have improved survival of premature and term infants. Unfortunately survivors of premature birth often suffer from neurologic morbidity. Clinical studies have identified hyperoxia as a risk factor for cerebral palsy. Experimental studies show that short exposure to high oxygen levels can trigger neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain. This neuronal death is associated with reduced expression of neurotrophins and decreased concentrations of survival-promoting proteins. To explore further pathogenetic mechanisms, we investigated the impact of supraphysiological oxygen levels on members of the proapoptotic Fas (CD95/APO-1) signalling pathway: Fas-Ligand, caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, FADD and FLIP.MethodsSix day old rats were exposed with their mothers to 80% O2 and were sacrificed at defined time points (2, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 hrs). Brains were either examined histologically to visualize degenerating cells or were processed for molecular studies.Sensitization by Lipopolysaccharide to in Vitro Ischemia in a Murine Juvenile Organotypic Hippocampal Slice CultureT Markus1, T Cronberg2, C Cilio3, D C R Ley1,1Department of Pediatrics, Lund University, Sweden, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University, Sweden, 3Department of Experimental Brain Research, Lund University, Sweden, 4Department of Neurology, Lund University, SwedenBackground and AimsFetal inflammatory response appears an important cause of damage in the immature brain. The hippocampal slice culture enables study of the interaction between induced inflammation and ischemia and of subsequent neuronal damage in the immature brain.MethodsHippocampal slices from BALB/C mice obtained at P5, placed on Millicell culture inserts and grown in vitro for 8 days. Hippocampal slices co-incubated with/without LPS, 1 microg/ml for 24 h and thereafter subjected to oxygenglucose deprivation for 15 min. Cytokine levels (IL-6, IL-10, TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, IL-12p40 and MCP-1) and nitric oxide production determined at repeated time points. Cell death was determined with propidium iodide (PI) measured by fluorescent light michroscopy and digital image analysis.Estrogen Protects Astrocytes Against Hyperoxia Induced ApoptosisS Huppmann, S Roemer, A Muench, M Berns, M ObladenDepartment of Neonatology, Charite Campus Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsIn premature infants oxygen free radicals are associated with subsequent diseases like retinopathia of prematurity and bronchopulmonal dysplasia. Recent studies in brain tissue samples have shown that nonphysiologic oxygen levels play a key role in induction of apoptosis in the developing brain. As female preterm infants consistently revealed a better neurological outcome then males, estrogen is considered to be neuroprotective in the premature brain. Astrocytes appear to have a critical role in protection and survival of neurons in the brain. As one of the glial cell types they have a great potential for possible involvement in the mediation of estrogen neuroprotective effects. Cell cultures of astrocytes have not yet been investigated concerning their behaviour in hyperoxic environment. The aim of our study was to analyze whether astrocytes in cell cultures are damaged by hyperoxia and whether estrogen can protect them against apoptosis.MethodsCell cultures of astrocytes (rat brain glial cells, C6) were cultivated in 80% compared to 21% oxygen environment and in different concentrations of 17beta-estradiol. Apoptosis was verified with caspase 3 staining by flow cytometric analysis.Hypoxia-Ischemia (Hi) Modifies Postnatal Gliogenic Activities in the Rat Cerebral CortexS V Sizonenko1, E Camm1, A Dayer2, J Z Kiss21Department of Pediatrics, University of Geneva, Switzerland, 2Department of Fundamental Neurosciences, University of Geneva, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsNeurogenesis is completed after birth, whereas gliogenic activities remain intense during the postnatal period in the rat cortex. Little is known about the effects of HI on these critical postnatal processes. The aim is to study the glial proliferation after HI injury in the P3 rat parietal cortex (PCx).MethodsP3 rats had right carotid ligation and 30′ exposure to 6%O2. Glial markers were used: GFAP, NG2, RIP. Brdu was injected 24h after HI and brains collected 48h, 72h and 7d after HI. Another group had Brdu injection 7d after HI and brain collected at 8d. Within the PCx proliferation was measured by counting double-labelled cells. The ipsilateral PCx was compared to the contralateral using the Wilcoxon test.Hyperoxia Causes Oxidative Stress and Increases Neural Stem Cells Proliferation in the Murine Developing BrainS Handley, A Sola, X Wang, T Wen, T Genetta, J Moore, M RogidoDivision of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USABackground and AimsStudies show hyperoxia results in apoptosis in immature murine brains, however, little is known about hyperoxia’s effect on neural progenitor/stem cells in developing brains. Our study attempts to determine effects of exposure to 96% oxygen versus room air on neural progenitor/stem cells in newborn mice.MethodsPups expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under nestin gene control were randomized into 2 groups (n=5/group). P5 animals were subjected to normoxia (FiO2-0.21), or hyperoxia (FiO2-0.96), for 90 minutes then injected with BrDu x3 over 24 hours and euthanized. Apoptotic-like changes were determined by TUNEL staining. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess lipid peroxidation and oxidative DNA damage with 4-Hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE) and 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8OHdG) monoclonal antibodies. Proliferation was assessed using anti-BrdU antibody. Nestin+ cells were identified by immunofluorescent microscopy. Cells were counted in 20 fields in cortical and ventricular/subventricular zones (VZ).

Currently the physiologic mechanisms of how hypothermia leads to neuroprotection are not fully understood. Our objective was to evaluate the role of hypothermia on EPO receptor expression and to determine if hypothermia plus EPO has an effect on cellular signaling.MethodsIsolated cultures of E18 rat cortical neurons were obtained from Genlantis. Cells were fully differentiate for 5 days and then exposed to either hypothermia or allowed to remain at 37 C. Anti-rabbit EPO receptor antibody was used in conjunction with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated antirabbit IgG for immunostaining. Calcium signaling was studied with the indicator dye Fluo-4 AM.Does Nicotine Protect Against Brain Damage?J H Andresen1, R Solberg1, B H Munkeby1, B Stray Pedersen2, O D Saugstad11Dept of Pediatric Research, 2Dept of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National Hospital, University of Oslo, NorwayBackground and AimsInflammation is regarded a main cause of cerebral damage, and is believed to be exacerbated by hypoxia. Nicotine has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties in experimental studies. We wish to assess the effect of nicotine on newborn piglet’s ability to tolerate hypoxia.MethodsFour groups of newborn piglets (12–36 hours) were studied: In two groups animals were randomized to receive either saline or nicotine prior to hypoxia, in two other groups they received nicotine or saline without hypoxia. Global hypoxia was induced by ventilation with 8% oxygen in N2 until Base Excess (BE) &lt; − 20 mmol/L or mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) = 15 mmHg. Microdialysis probes were stereotactically inserted into the striatum before the experiment started, to measure glycerol, a marker of hypoxic injury.The A-B-C of Streptococcal Infections in the PICUN J G Jansen, A J van VughtPediatric Intensive Care Unit, Dept of Pediatrics, The Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital, University Medical Center Utrecht, The NetherlandsThe group A streptococcus (GAS), also known as Streptococcus pyogenes, causes a wide range of infections and complications. It is the most frequent cause of bacterial pharyngitis. But it can also cause a variety of cutaneous and invasive infections, such as pyoderma, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) and myositis, and other complications such as rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. Although the global burden of GAS infections it not known it has been described that at least 517.000 people die each year due to severe GAS infections, eg acute rheumatic fever and invasive infections. Therefore, GAS figures among the 10 major human pathogens worldwide, only clearly exceeded by HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and Streptococcus pneumoniae. GAS is a well known cause of severe infections and sepsis/shock in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with a reported mortality rate of 15–25%. The wide range of diseases by GAS with varying severity has been postulated to be due to phenotypic variation in GAS. Differences in virulence factor productions, in ability to invade human epithelial cells and in secretion of high concentrations of exotoxins (A-B-C) are described. However, very recently the difference between a simple GAS pharyngeal disease and a more disseminated, severe disease, eg. Toxic Shock Syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis, is traced to mutations in two regulatory genes. A single mutation in a global two-component signalling locus, the so-called Control of virulence R/S (CovRS) system, alters expression of 10–15% of the genes. The mutation in CovRS shifts the expression from a pharyngeal transcriptome (PTP) to an invasive transcriptome (ITP), which can result in more invasive disease in human and mice. By ongoing knowledge at the molecular and gene-expression level, it becomes more and more clear how bacteria interact with their hosts to cause a range of diseases that are associated with infection. As translational medicine, from laboratory to bedside (PICU), develops further it will be possible to treat patients in the future more directly at the molecular-level of their disease. Also the development of a vaccine against GAS is a possibility to reduce the colonisation of tonsils and eliminate the dreadful forms of streptococcal infections. In the mean time the treatment of invasive GAS infections includes management of the complications of sepsis, aggressive surgical debridement if a site of infection is identified and antibiotics for the underlying infection. GAS remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, clinical failures of penicillin therapy for streptococcal infections do occur. Therefore, Clindamycin is recommended in invasive GAS infections together with penicillin or a carbapenem. Infections with GAS are still an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in less developed countries, and its global importance has been under-estimated. By new developments in molecular and translational medicine in the near future it will be possible to improve outcome in GAS infections substantially.The Incidence of Infections of Ventricular Reservoirs in the Treatment of Post Haemorrhagic Ventricular DilatationA J Brouwer1, F Groenendaal1, A van den Hoogen1, M Verboon-Maciolek{ur1}, P Hanlo2, K Rademaker1, L S de Vries11Departments of Neonatology, 2Department of Neurosurgery, Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsInfants with a progressive posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) have been treated in our neonatal intensive care unit with a ventricular reservoir since 1992. The incidence of infection using this invasive procedure was studied retrospectively.MethodsBetween January 1992 and December 2003, 76 preterm infants were treated with a ventricular reservoir. Infants admitted during two subsequent periods were analysed, group 1:1992–1997 (n=26) and group 2:1998–2003 (n=50). Clinical characteristics and number of reservoir punctures were evaluated. Furthermore the incidence of complications over time was assessed, with a focus on the occurrence of infection of the reservoir.Visualisation of Wounds to Improve the Quality of Wound CareE J Dekker1, B A H Versluis2,3{sa1}PICU, 2Directorate Information, Department of Management and Maintenance Information Systems, 3PICU/NICU, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsPhysicians and nurses on a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) are being confronted with a diversity of patients wounds. Wounds were being observed subjectively by physicians and nurses. A wound care assessment tool was not used. Our PICU is organized with a Patient Data Management System (PDMS). This PDMS system provides the PICU staff the possibility to develop a digital photo registration of the wound that can be downloaded to the PDMS system. The aim of this project is to use the developed digital photo system in the PDMS to guide the process of wound care and eventually improve wound rehabilitation in the critically ill child.MethodsPhotos are made by using a digital camera. After taken the photo of the wound, the photo is downloaded into the Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS). Photos are linked to the PDMS, to the family name and patient identification number. Photos can be shown on the bedside computer.The Spanish ConnectionM A Gonzalez CaviedesMadrid, SpainAbstract not available at the time of printing.Have We Lost the Basics of Our Nursing Role?J HeijstekThe NetherlandsAbstract not available at the time of printing.Present and Future of Surfactant Therapy.

Strong preclinical data demonstrated that impaired production of nitric oxide (NO) contributes to the pathogenesis of abnormal alveolar and vascular growth in experimental models of BPD, and that prolonged treatment with inhaled NO (iNO) improves lung structure and function in neonatal animals. However, whether iNO therapy could improve long-term outcomes of premature newborns remains uncertain. We hypothesized that prolonged treatment with low doses of iNO would reduce the incidence of BPD without worsening brain injury. We further hypothesized that the effects of iNO therapy may be partly dependent upon the degree of prematurity.MethodsWe conducted an IRB-approved, multicenter randomized trial at 16 centers to determine the effects of iNO in preterm newborns (gestational age s&lt; 34 weeks; BW, 500 – 1250 gms) who required intubation and mechanical ventilation during the first 48 hours of life. Newborns were stratified by BW strata (500–749 g, 750 – 999 g, or 1000 – 1250 g) prior to randomization to iNO (5 ppm) or placebo gas. Assignment remained masked to care providers and families. BPD was defined by an oxygen requirement and abnormal chest x-ray at 36 weeks corrected age. Cranial ultrasounds were obtained prior to enrollment (for baseline incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage), at 7–14 days, and at more than 30 days of age. Power analysis determined that 792 infants were needed to detect a reduction in the incidence of death and BPD from 60% to 50%, given a statistical power of 80% and a 2-sided alpha of 0.05.Novel Developments in VaccinologyR MoxonOxford Vaccine Group, Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, UKImmunisation is currently the most effective public health tool for reducing the enormous global morbidity and mortality from infections. In humans, effective vaccines are second only to the availability of clean water in terms of their impact on reducing the burden of infections. In humans, vaccines have eliminated or substantially reduced at least nine major viral and bacterial infections. These successes must be viewed in the context of the huge unmet challenges for which novel developments in vaccines can provide enormous benefits in the future. The challenge of providing improved or novel vaccines comes at a time when the rise in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance poses diabolical problems and the global spread of pathogens is increasingly facilitated by unprecedented population densities in megacities, rapidity of travel, complex food chains and the many natural and human-inflicted disasters that disrupt societal infrastructures. This discussion will focus selectively on some of the potential opportunities provided by the application of ‘cutting edge’ science for the improvement of our current vaccines and future development of novel vaccines.Vaccination and Otitis MediaR DaganPediatric Infectious Disease Unit, Soroka University Medical Center and the Faculty of Health Sciences, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, IsraelBackground and AimsOtitis media (OM) is the most common bacterial infection in children aged &lt; 5 years for which antibiotic treatment is prescribed worldwide. Although most of the time this entity resolves spontaneously it is associated with morbidity, family dysfunction, antibiotic use and burden on the medical system. Efforts to reduce the burden of OM by vaccination have not been extremely rewarding, but some progress has been made.MethodsReview of the topic.Vaccination in Developing CountriesH NohynekHelsinki, FinlandAbstract not available at the time of printing.Novel Vaccination StrategiesH RümkeThe NetherlandsAbstract not available at the time of printing.Inflammation, Preterm Delivery and the CNSH HagbergPerinatal Center, Sahlgrenska Academy, East Hospital, KK, Goteborg, SwedenInfection causes spontaneous preterm delivery especially at low gestation (&lt;30 weeks). These infections can be in the urinary tract, peritoneal cavity (appendicitis), oral cavity (periodontal disease) or be systemic suggesting transplacental passage for some of these infections. More commonly, however, microbes are believed to ascend into the uterine cavity from the lower genital tract. A maternal inflammation is induced with infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the chorioamniotic membranes and in the chorion plate of the placenta. Eventually, inflammatory cells accumulate also in the umbilical cord indicating a fetal inflammatory response. Indeed, a multitude of cytokines and chemokines accumulate in the cervicovaginal fluid, amniotic fluid and fetal blood and the levels exhibit an association with preterm delivery and neonatal morbidity. Except for treatment of urinary tract infections, antibiotic treatment of patients with bacterial vaginosis or those presenting with preterm contractions have not been successful in prolongation of pregnancy or in reducing neonatal morbidity. This could be due to 1. that preterm birth has multiple causes and, hence, only infectious-related preterm birth could be expected to respond to anti-microbial treatment. 2. Infection induces inflammation which is considered to be critical for induction of preterm birth and neonatal organ damage. Antibiotics may have to be combined with antiinflammatory therapies to be effective, e.g. progesterone and corticosteroids have both proved beneficial and they are both strong anti-inflammatory agents. 3. The infectious/inflammatory process starts early in gestation and treatment at the time of preterm contractions may be too late. Indeed, it has been shown that the presence of ureaplasma Urealyticym or increased cytokines in the amniotic fluid at midgestation predict late abortions/preterm birth. We hypothesize that such chronic “low-intensity” inflammation during pregnancy may be critical not only with respect to preterm birth but also to long-term CNS development, vulnerability and injury. Systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adult animals induces upregulation of cytokines and activation of microglia in the brain, which was accompanied by a substantial decrease in CNS neurogenesis. High doses of LPS applied between the chorio-amniotic membranes in pregnant mice at embryonic day (ED) 15 (75% gestation) induces preterm birth. However, much lower doses of LPS at ED 15 does not induce preterm birth but elicits a chronic state of CNS inflammation and the animals develop more extensive brain lesions if later exposed to hypoxiaischemia during postnatal life (Wang et al. 2006). Furthermore, maternal LPS induces inflammation, hypomyelination and cell death in the brain of the postnatal offspring. Intrauterine infection causes preterm birth in a subset of patients. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the inflammatory process starts early in gestation. The immuno-inflammatory activation during pregnancy may have programming long-term influences on CNS development and vulnerability.Prevention of Inflammatory Damage — Is A Double-Edged Sword Needed to Fight Hydra in Wonderland?O Dammann1,2, P Gressens31Perinatal Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany 2Neuroepidemiology Unit, Children’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA 3UMR 676 and INSERM-Paris 7 and Service de Neuropediatrie, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, FranceKnowledge continues to accumulate from perinatal and neonatal inflammation research suggesting that each solution to a riddle in this field is accompanied by the appearance of (at least two) new ones. This reminds us of the mythical serpent Hydra, one of whose nine heads was immortal. The beast quickly grew two new heads for each one Hercules chopped off. Recent research suggests that inflammatory processes play a role in most, if not all, neonatal disorders of the brain, eye, lung, and gut. Moreover, systemic inflammation issues require close attention. We should not surrender to complexity, but take it as a stimulation to move ahead. The traditional view that the immune system’s primary task is to maintain health by fending off ‘non-self’ has been challenged by Polly Matzinger (Science, 2002), who suggests to give ‘danger’ the role of the offender. Her model proposes that alarm signals from stressed tissues rather than specific forms of antigen define the design of the immune response. Although this theory might explain some non-self-tolerance phenomena rather elegantly, we are now obviously left with the task to identify and characterize the alarm signals proposed by the theory. Much of the danger theory revolves around the mechanisms of adaptive immunity (i.e., Tcell activation). Thus, we will need to clarify whether the innate immune response itself constitutes a danger signal, and how much of the danger signal we call ‘inflammation’ causes damage in and of itself. Finally, we need to figure out how we can prevent the consequences of such danger. For those who consider adult medicine less than straight forward, fetal / neonatal medicine might look like Wonderland — a strange world, where almost nothing is to be taken at face value and apparent paradoxes wait for us at every corner. Here are three rather simplistic examples: antenatal infection reduces postnatal respiratory distress, but increases the risk for longterm bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Watterberg et al, 1996); antenatal glucocorticoids reduce the risk of developmental disability, while neonatal glucocorticoids increase the risk (O’shea &amp; Doyle, 2001); maternal, but not fetal, administration of steroids reduce growth (Newnham et al, 1999). In this presentation, we offer speculations about potential future developments in perinatal and neonatal care in order to begin planning preventive intervention. Much of the work that needs to be done involves concepts such as signal detection, characterization of danger, and intervention design. Extreme caution needs to be exerted when working on these issues, because inflammation might (in part) be beneficial. Therefore, anti-inflammatory strategies are likely to come from the armamentarium of double-edged swords. According to Greek mythology, Hydra was eventually killed only because Iolaus helped his uncle to chop off the immortal ninth head. Unfortunately, because Hercules had not managed to do it all by himself, the success was not counted towards his ten labors. Still, we believe that it will take exactly this kind of teamwork to eventually reduce the dangers brought to perinatal Wonderland by inflammation.Hyperoxic Resuscitation Increases Oxidative Stress and Changes in Gene ExpressionR Solberg1, J Andresen1, S Tunheim2, G I A Borge3, M Bjorås4, B H Munkeby1, O D Saugstad11Department of Pediatric Research, University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway 2Centre for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 3Norwegian Food Institute, As, Norway 4Centre for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience, University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, NorwayBackground and AimsResuscitation at birth with pure oxygen is associated with long term detrimental effects. We tested if there is a dose-response correlation between oxygen level and subsequent changes in antioxidant capacity and gene expression.MethodsPiglets (12–36h) underwent hypoxia until BE-20mmol/l or blood pressure &lt;15mmHg, and were then resuscitated for 15 min with 21%, 40%, 60% and 100% oxygen (n=12, n=10, n=10, n=10, baseline n=10) and thereafter observed for 1h. To study gene-expression we used GeneChip® Porcine Genome Array. The Microarrays were performed through isolation of RNA from snap frozen lung tissue. DNA repair activities counteracting the effect of base lesions on DNA, including oxidative damages, were monitored in cellfree protein-extracts.Chemokine mRNA Levels in Preterm Neonates with InflammationA Mouchtouri1, E Levi1, E Petrakou1, G Liosis2, M Xanthou1, S Fotopoulos11Neonatal Immunology Laboratory, B’ Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, “Aghia Sophia” Children’s Hospital, Athens, Greece, 2Neonatal Unit, “Elena Venizelou” Perinatal Centre, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsInflammation due to perinatal infection and asphyxia may cause damage to various tissues and very often to the immature brain of the fetus and the newborn. Previously we have shown that the neonatal immune system has the ability to produce increased chemokine protein levels in the serum during the inflammatory response caused by perinatal infection and asphyxia. The aim of our present study was to investigate mRNA levels of the proinflammatory chemokines IL-8 and MCP-1 in infected and asphyxiated neonates.MethodsForty-two premature neonates were studied; 11 with perinatal infection (PI), 16 with perinatal asphyxia (PA) and 15, without PA and PI, were used as controls. IL-8 and MCP-1 mRNA levels were investigated in whole blood and in PHA-activated lymphocytes using semi-quantitative PCR and real time PCR, respectively.Effects of Hyperoxia and Nitric Oxide on Endogenous Nitric Oxide Production in Polymorphonuclear LeukocytesT Hoehn1, A Gratopp2, K Raehse3, P Koehne31Neonatology and Pediatric Intensive Care, Department of General Pediatrics, University Hospital of Duesseldorf, Germany, 2Department of General Pediatrics, Charité Virchow Hospital, Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany, 3Department of Neonatology, Charité Virchow Hospital, Humboldt University, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsExposure towards hyperoxia and nitric oxide (NO) occur frequently during the treatment of neonatal hypoxic pulmonary failure. To analyse the response of neonatal polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) to hyperoxia and NO in vitro.MethodsNeonatal cord blood was exposed to 100% oxygen, NO 20ppm plus 100% oxygen, and NO 20ppm for 30 minutes. Flow cytometry was used to quantify production of nitric oxide by measurement of the intracellular dye DAF-2 DA.Is Chorioamnionitis Associated with Adverse Neonatal Outcome Independent of Its Effect on Preterm Birth?J V Been1, R F Kornelisse2, I Rours2, F Jonkers3, A J Schneider4, R R de Krijger5, L J Zimmermann11Department of Neonatology, Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Paediatrics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 3Department of Internal Medicine, Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The Netherlands 4Department of Obstetrics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 5Department of Pathology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsSeveral retrospective studies have shown chorioamnionitis to be associated with adverse neonatal outcome. However, findings have been contradictory and despite the fact that chorioamnionitis is an important cause of preterm delivery, few studies have adjusted their data for gestational age. Our aim was to compare short-term outcome parameters between patients with and without chorioamnionitis in a large prospective study.MethodsOver a two-year period all infants born in the Erasmus MC at ≤32 weeks gestation were prospectively included in this study. Relevant clinical data and placental histopathology were obtained from each infant. Outcome parameters were compared between infants with histological chorioamnionitis (HC) and those without (non-HC).Bile Acids in Broncho-Alveolar Lavage Fluid of Near-Term Neonates with Severe RDSE Zecca1, S Baroni2, D De Luca1, M Marras1, G Vento1, C Romagnoli11NICU, Division of Neonatology, Catholic University of The Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy, 2Institute of Biochemistry, Catholic University of The Sacred Heart, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is associated with an increased risk of RDS in near term neonates. [1] The diagnosis of bile acid pneumonia has been proposed on the basis of a causative role of bile acids (BA) [2]. Because hyaline membranes have been demonstrated in rabbits after tracheal instillation of BA [3] we hypothesized that abnormally high BA levels in ICP could reverse the reaction of phospholipase-A2 in the alveoli, leading to a lack of surfactant. Finding detectable BA in the lung of affected infants could strongly support this hypothesis.MethodsWe measured BA levels in broncho-alveolar lavage (BALF) of 4 neonates affected by BA pneumonia and in 7 control infants, matched for gestational age, who required mechanical ventilation for reasons different from lung diseases. BA were analyzed, as previously published, [4] in the first day of life. Maternal and neonatal plasma BA levels were also recorded.Lung Healing in Ards: Role of Ion ChannelsU H ThomeDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Ulm, GermanyBackground and AimsThe prenatal lung works as an exocrine gland and secretes fluid, which contributes to amniotic fluid and facilitates lung growth. After birth, fluid secretion has to cease as any excess fluid in the alveolar space will hamper gas exchange. Furthermore, excess fluid must be absorbed out of the alveolar space (alveolar fluid clearance). This is one of the most important processes in the transition to extrauterine life, and continuously thereafter. Expression of fluid by the birth canal is of minor importance. Cell physiologic and animal studies have elucidated the transport mechanisms and carrier proteins involved. Sodium ions are taken up by alveolar type II cells, previously known as the producers of surfactant, through epithelial sodium channels located in the apical membrane, and are actively extruded into the interstitial space by Na, KATPases in the basolateral membrane. Water follows passively the resulting osmotic forces. The fluid is removed from the interstitial space by blood capillaries and lymph vessels.MethodsIn respiratory distress syndrome, impaired epithelial transport and increased epithelial leakage result in increased alveolar fluid content, leading to impaired gas exchange and surfactant inactivation. Clinical studies have shown that the survival of patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome is dependent on the activity of their alveolar fluid clearance. Likewise, the severity of respiratory distress in premature infants is linked to the activity of epithelial sodium transport mechanisms.Surfactant in Pediatric ARDSL GortnerDepartment of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Homburg, GermanyBackground and AimsSecondary surfactant deficiency and increased pulmonary vasculare are the mainstays of pediatric ARDS. This disorder still is characterized by a substantial mortality and se-vere long-term sequelae. It was thus the aim, to assess the efficacy of surfactant treat-ment in pediatric ARDS after having established its efficacy in neonates with RDS.MethodsTwo controlled clinical trials have been conducted, investigating natural surfactant preparations in pediatric ARDS (1, 2), a number of studies described its effects in case-series, however, without enrolling controls.Cerebral Oxygenation (ScO2), Fractional Tissue Oxygen Extraction (FTOE) and Brain Activity in Preterm Infants with RDS: The Effect of CPAP Versus SIMV and HFOVP M Lemmers1, M Toet1, L J van Schelven2, F van Bel11Department of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Biomedical Engineering, Wilhelmina Children’s Hospital, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn the etiology of damage to the immature brain, RDS-induced disturbances in cerebral oxygenation, hemodynamics and lack of cerebral autoregulation play an important role. To examine the effect of the type of ventilatory support (CPAP, SIMV, HFOV) on cerebral oxygenation, brain perfusion and activity, arterial O2 saturation (SaO2), NIRS-determined cerebral O2-supply (ScO2) and O2-extraction (FTOE: (SaO2-ScO2/SaO2)), blood pressure (MABP) and amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) were monitored during the first 72 hours of life.MethodsFrom 36 preterms (GA &lt;32 wks) with surfactant-dependent RDS 10, 14 and 12 were treated with CPAP with InSurE procedure (Intubation, Surfactant, Ectubation), synchronized intermittend mandatory ventilation (SIMV) or high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) respectively. From each patient an average of a 60 min reliable monitoring period was used every 6 hours (from birth up to day 3) for SaO2, ScO2, FTOE, MABP and aEEG. Correlation coefficients between MABP and ScO2 and between MABP and FTOE were determined every 15 min to detect possible lack of autoregulation.The Effect of Furosemide on Alveolar Epithelial Cell ProliferationB Ackermann1,2, A W Flemmer1,21Department of Neonatology, Children’s Hospital, Center of Perinatology, LM-University Munich, Germany, 2Center of Pediatrich Research, LM-University Munich, GermanyBackground and AimsFurosemide, a potent inhibitor of Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC), has been used repetitively for neonates with pulmonary disease. In airway smooth muscle cells it was suggested, that Furosemide inhibits cell proliferation. Yet the effect of Furosemide on alveolar epithelial cell proliferation has not been studied.MethodsNKCC expression and distribution in alveolar epithelial cells (A549 cells) were assessed by immunoblotting and -staining. To test the effect of Furosemide on cell proliferation, alveolar epithelial cells (A549-cells) were cultured with Furosemide, at 0–1200 μM. At 96 hours proliferation was determined by cell count related to seeded cells. Cell DNA-content was studied in permeabilized cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using propidium iodide. Proliferating cells were defined as high-DNA-cells (double DNA content, G2 / mitotic), whereas low DNAcells were assumed to be in G1-phase.Lucinactant (Surfaxin®) Reduces Reintubation Rates with Improved Outcomes vs Other Surfactants — Results of two Randomized, Controlled TrialsF R Moya1, S Sinha2, J Gadzinowski3, C Guardia4, J Mazela4, G Liu41Department of Neonatology, Coastal AHEC, Wilmington, NC, USA, 2Department of Paediatrics, James Cook University Hospital, Middlesbrough, UK 3Department of Neonatology, Poznan University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland, 4Discovery Laboratories, Inc., Warrington, PA, USABackground and AimsMany infants who are extubated after initial surfactant administration require reintubation. Repeated or prolonged reintubation may place them at higher risk of adverse outcomes. We examined extubation and reintubation rates and their impact on key clinical outcomes in infants treated with lucinactant vs colfosceril and beractant from the SELECT trial (Moya, et al. Pediatrics. 2005;115:1018) and vs poractant from the STAR trial (Sinha, et al. Pediatrics. 2005;115:1030).MethodsThe rates of initial extubation, subsequent reintubation, and death or BPD were compared using logistic regression adjusted for birth weight stratum and center.How Small Is Small Enough? Determination of the Optimal Aerosol Particle Size for Inhalation Therapy in Preterm Infants in VitroS Minocchieri1, M A Bachmann1, J Burren1, R Kaeser3, J H Wildhaber2, M Nelle11Division of Neonatology, University Children’s Hospital, Bern, Switzerland, 2Division of Respiratory Medicine, University Children’s Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland, 3Division of Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care, Children’s Hospital, Luzern, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsAs inhaled therapy in preterm infants with IRDS (Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome) or CLD (Chronic Lung Disease) is difficult, the current therapy consists of Surfactant instilled through a tracheal tube or systemic steroids applied orally or intravenously. Current commercially available inhalation devices are not suitable for this age group. New mesh devices able to produce very small particles may allow age specific aerosol therapy and may be applicable even in preterm infants. This in vitro study assesses the particle size of nebulised aerosols and the distribution in the upper airways and estimates a predicted lung dose for preterm infants.MethodsBudesonide was nebulised through a standard e-Flow device (Pari GmbH, Starnberg, Germany) with two different perforated vibrating membranes (3.5µm and 2.5µm pore diameter) attached to an upper airway model of a 32 weeks gestational age preterm infant by a face mask followed by an NG (New Generation) impactor. Particle size distribution as well as lung dose were expressed as a percentage of the total dose and assessed using an HPLC-method.The Effect of Fetal Tracheal Occlusion on Lung Tissue Mechanics in a Rabbit Model for Diaphragmatic HerniaA W Flemmer1, J C Jani2,4, K Hajek1, F Bergmann3, O J Münsterer3, J Deprest2,41Department of Neonatology, Children’s Hospital Center of Perinatology Grosshadern, LM-University, Munich, Germany, 2Center for Surgical Technologies, Faculty of Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, Belgium, 3Department of Pediatric Surgery, LM University, Munich, Germany, 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Faculty of Medicine, Katholieke Universiteit, Leuven, BelgiumBackground and AimsDiaphragmatic hernia (DH) is associated with high mortality and morbidity. Fetal tracheal occlusion (FETO) has been suggested to accelerate lung growth and development in DH. We evaluated the effect of FETO on lung growth and postnatal lung tissue mechanics.MethodsLeft sided DH was surgically created in fetal rabbits at 23 days of gestation (term 31 days). 5 days later, FETO was performed and compared to non-FETO and sham operated animals. At term, fetuses were delivered by cesarean section. Lung to body weight ratio (LBWR), total lung capacity (TLC), dynamic compliance (Crs) and resistance (Rrs) were measured. In addition we measured lung input impedance by forced oscillation technique (FOT) and lung tissue elastance (HL), tissue resistance (GL), hysteresivity eta (GL/HL) and small airway resistance (Raw) were calculated from impedance data.Education in the Neonatal and Paediatric Intensive CareO FrauenfelderThe NetherlandsAbstract not available at the time of printing.Evaluation of an Insulin Protocol to Treat Hyperglycaemia in the PICUM M van de Polder, S B Brand, J J Verhoeven, K F M JoostenDepartment of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn critically ill children hyperglycaemia (&gt;8 mmol/L) is associated with an increased mortality but it is not known if insulin therapy will improve outcome. Aim of the study was to evaluate a hyperglycaemic treatment protocol trying to lower blood glucose &lt; 8 mmol/L within 12 hours after start of insulin treatment in critically ill children admitted to the PICU.MethodsRetrospective evaluation of the incidence and treatment of hyperglycaemia of all children admitted to the PICU in relation to the glucose intake. Results: In a 4 months period in 80 non-diabetic children blood glucose control was done within 24 hours after admission to the PICU. In 33/80 of the children blood glucose was initially &gt;8 mmol/L (mean 10,5 mmol/L). The glucose intake in only 5 children was according to the protocol (in 6 too high and in 22 too low). Excluded for treatment were 20 children because a second blood glucose was normalised (13x) and various other reasons (7x). The mean interval between the first and second blood glucose control was 120 min. Eight children were treated according the protocol. Mean duration of treatment was 55 hours (range 8–128 hr). In 7 of the 8 children within 12 hours (mean 10,5 hr) blood glucose was &lt;8 mmol/L. No hypoglycaemia occurred.A Research Program to Examine Evidence-Based Thermoregulation Practices in Preterm NewbornsM Schindler1, F Loersch1, S Dahlmann1, C Herzner1, I Berlet1, T Schaible1, P Heep2, L Lynam21Neonatal Intensive Care, Klinikum Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany, 2GE Maternal Infant Care Clinical Research Department, Laurel, MD, USABackground and AimsThermoregulation is a critical component of neonatal care. Yet many of the practices surrounding thermoregulation have not been re-tested despite the marked changes in viability has over the last 4 decades. With this foundation, one should realize that approximately 50% of global NICUs practice babycontrol philosophies of thermoregulation while the rest practice an air-control philosophy. Is the evidence base all that is should or could be?MethodsThirty preterm infants &lt; 1500g were randomized to either Giraffe baby control mode or Giraffe air control mode. The Giraffe was set-up and pre-warmed according to manufacturer’s guidelines in closed bed/incubator/manual mode. The initial thermal goal was to maintain central skin temperature at 36.5 degrees C in both groups and rectal temperature within a range of 36.8 to 37.3 degrees C. Added humidity was controlled at 60–80%. Physiological variables were measured each minute over the period of data collection.The Development of A Programme to Increase Staff Awareness of Their Roles and Responsibilities in Risk ManagementI M Thruston, L Singharam Chettair, J EnterkinPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Evelina Childrens’ Hospital, Guys’ and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UKBackground and AimsPatients deserve and expect safe care and the identification and prevention of adverse incidents has become an important part of Clinical Governance. Errors are usually complex and caused or exacerbated by many interacting causes. People make mistakes and poor systems increase the likelihood of error. Reporting and monitoring of adverse incidents helps facilitate learning and allow the direction of future preventative strategies.MethodsA strategy developed and introduced by the PICU Education and Management teams, to reduce adverse incidents, is a programme to increase staffs’ awareness of their roles and responsibilities in risk management. The programme includes presentations from the National Patient Safety Agency and the Trust Clinical Risk Team, feedback of local adverse incident follow up and analysis, group work and presentation of their work. Group work may involve a snapshot audit of prescription errors, for example, from which the group will then identify a project they will undertake over several months. Their projects will include findings and proposed action plans and they will present their work to the rest of the PICU team by way of oral and poster presentations.The Neosafe Project: Lessons From A Specialty-Based Incident Reporting SystemC Snijders1, A Molendijk1, R A van Lingen1, W P F Fetter2, T W van der Schaaf31Department of Neonatology, Isala Clinics, Zwolle, The Netherlands, 2Department of Neonatology, Free University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 3Department of Technology Management, University of Technology, Eindhoven, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsTo examine the occurrence and severity of incidents in neonatal intensive care units (NICU’s) in The Netherlands; and to identify underlying system factors of incidents related to medication, mechanical ventilation and vascular catheters.MethodsStudy design: Prospective multicenter study. In July 2005, voluntary, non-anonymous, non-punitive incident reporting was introduced in eight level III NICU’s and one paediatric surgical intensive care. An incident was defined as any unintended event which (could have) reduced the safety margin for the patient. Multidisciplinary committees analysed incidents pertaining to medication, intravascular catheters and mechanical ventilation for underlying root causes, using the PRISMA methodology (κ statistics of 0.68 for interrater reliability). We describe results of the first six months of reporting.Nutritional Supplementation During Pregnancy and LactationR BergmannDepartment of Pediatrics, Charité Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, GermanyThe nutritional status of pregnant and lactating women has implications not only for their own health, but also for that of their infants. The consequences of insufficient or excessive intake of macro- and micro-nutrients influence the outcome of pregnancy, and may also have long-term effects on the health of the child and the future adult. An optimal supply of all important vitamins and minerals is thus essential for pregnant women. Their requirements with respect to a number of vitamins and minerals are considerably higher than those of women who are not pregnant. As these additional requirements cannot always be satisfied by a normal diet — even in societies with an abundance of food — micronutrient deficiencies occur (hidden hunger), and since detailed individualised nutritional supply levels cannot always be verified, dietary supplements seem advisable for all pregnant women. These supplements may even contain ‘functional foods’; foodstuffs whose function goes beyond simply covering nutritional requirements, and which are beneficial to the health of the mother and her infant. The presentation will address the nutrients of special relevance for the pregnant woman and the fetus, and also their importance as supplements during pregnancy.Absorbing or Metabolizing? The Role of the Neonatal Gut with Regard to the DietJ B van GoudoeverDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Sophia Children’s Hospital, Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThe portal-drained viscera (stomach, intestine, pancreas and spleen) have a much higher rate of both energy expenditure and protein synthesis than can be estimated on the basis of their weight. A high utilization rate of dietary nutrients by the portal-drained viscera might result in a low systemic availability, which determines whole-body growth.MethodsFrom studies in our multiple catheterisized piglet model we conclude that more than half of the dietary protein intake is utilized within the portal-drained viscera and that amino acids are a major fuel source for the visceral organs.Feeding the Extremely Low Birth Weight InfantR J CookeDivision of Neonatology, University of Tennessee Center for Health Sciences, Memphis, TN, USANutrition plays a critical role during growth and development; the greater the growth rate the more critical the role, and none more so than that between 24 weeks of gestation and 2–3 months postnatal age, a time when even short periods of malnutrition has long term effects on growth and development. Studies show that under-nutrition and growth retardation are universal in preterm infants; the more immature the infant the greater the degree of under-nutrition and growth retardation. Whether this is entirely preventable or not is unclear. What is clear is that there are ‘critical periods’ in a preterm infant’s life during which the extent of under-nutrition and, therefore, growth retardation might be minimized, thus improving outcome in these high-risk infants.Making of the Brain: Genetic and Epigenetic Regulations. From Molecular Biology to ConsciousnessJ-P ChangeuxInstitut Pasteur, Paris, FranceIn the course of human evolution, the complexity of brain connectivity increasesd dramatically, while that of the genome did not change significantly. Several genetic mechanisms may plausible account for this paradoxical non-linear relationship such as the spatiotemporal and combinatorial action of developmental genes ie homeotic genes, microcephaly genes and/or several others. Alternatively, the state of activity (evoked/spontaneous) of the developing brain, during foetal life and in the newborn, may contribute to the development of brain organisation via ‘epigenetic’ mechanisms such as the selective stabilisation/elimination of developing synapses. Still, such processes are expected to be limited by a ‘genetic envelope’ which may include genes like those responsible for dyslexia, autism or fragile-X mental retardation. The mechanism of epigenesis by selective stabilisation of synapses was investigated using molecular biology techniques with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), the best known neurotransmitter-gated ion channel. Studies with mice deleted for defined subunits of the nAChR revealed a contribution of the spontaneous activity of the retina to the development of the adult visual pathways and maps. Moreover, the analysis of the transcriptional regulation of nAChR genes by electrical activity/neurotrophic factors during motor endplate morphogenesis established causal links between membrane electrical activity and nAChR genes promoters through transcription factors and second messenger pathways. In the brain, an efficient in vivo method involving the selective reexpression of defined genes by stereotaxic injections of lentiviral vectors is used to investigate the plasticity of adult brain circuits in cognitive learning. The importance of epigenetic regulation of synapse development (and its pathologies) in early learning processes, in cognitive and/or conscious functions and in cultural evolution, is discussed in the case of the development of the newborn infant and its pathologies such as autism, ADHD, sudden infant death disease.

Experimental models have improved our understanding of neuropathology and support a glutamate hypothesis of hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage. Substantial evidence indicates that antagonists of ion channel-linked glutamate receptors can reduce damage. In focal ischaemia, this is true for both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists and for non-NMDA (kainate/AMPA) antagonists. In such models, the magnitude of infarct reduction is typically in the order of 25 to 30%. Moving away from the direct effect of the receptor, there are either upstream or downstream sites for drug action. For example, upstream, glibenclamide (acting at the ATP sensitive potassium channel) prolongs the period over which hypoxia can be tolerated. Alternatively, downstream, dantrolene (acting at the endoplasmic reticulum to limit NMDA-initiated, calcium-mediated, calcium release from the ER pool) limits the induction of apoptosis.MethodsTo date, many pharmacological approaches, or combination of approaches, have been applied to animal models, with beneficial effects, which promise efficacy in patients. The NMDA receptor story, although teaching us much about pathophysiology, is an example where basic science has failed to deliver a significant clinical outcome. However, when it comes to extending experimental studies to clinical research trials there are some key questions.Pain: Not Only the BrainP G JorensDepartment of (Paediatrics) Critical Care Medicine, Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital of Antwerp, Edegem, BelgiumBackground and AimsAddressing pain, an inevitable phenomenon from birth until death, in infants and children is an important task for health care workers. Although some progress has been made, many children do not receive adequate attention to their pain.MethodsCurrent literature highlights a significant deficiency in our ability to assess pain, to understand the physiopathology and the pharmacokinetics and dynamics of analgesic drugs in this population A review of the topic and the current literature is given.The Assessment of Pain in Pre- or Nonverbal ChildrenL S FranckProfessor and Chair of Children’s Nursing Research, Centre for Nursing and Allied Health Professions Research, Institute of Child Health and Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, UKDespite over 30 years of research regarding measurement of pain in infants and children, there is no consensus regarding the optimal measures for research or to guide clinical management. At last count, there were over 40 published assessment scales for measuring pain in infants and children in the hospital setting. While it has been generally recognized that pain is a complex multidimensional experience, attention in pediatric pain measurement studies has remained largely focused on pain intensity, to the exclusion of measuring the meaning of the pain and its affective and behavioral consequences. There are numerous tools for assessment of acute pain in infants, but few have been shown to be valid for assessment of persistent pain or postoperative pain in critically children. More worrying, there remains minimal integration of pain measurement with pain treatment. Pain intensity scores have been successfully used to demonstrate the efficacy of analgesics in clinical trials. However, none of the published assessment scales provide evidence for implementing one treatment versus another for any given pain score. Possibly as a consequence of that lack of evidence, there is low compliance with pain assessment documentation in many units that have implemented standardized scales. If the measurement of pain does not lead to a treatment decision, and the effectiveness of that decision is not demonstrated by a meaningful change in the scale, what is the utility of the measure? Recent research suggests that specific behavioral and physiological indicators are valid and reliable proxy measures for pain in non-verbal children. The best indicators may vary based on age, severity of illness, degree of neurological impairment, context and type of observer (healthcare professional or parent. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in discriminating pain-related signs of distress from other etiologies. Recommendations for pain assessment in preverbal children will be suggested based on current evidence.Non-Pharmacological Pain Management in the Infant and ChildI HarthPICU, Children’s Hospital Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, GermanyBackground and AimsCritically ill children and infants might experience a stay on a PICU with a lot of stressors which may cause pain, discomfort and suffering. Providing comfort to these patients is a core duty of the nursing profession. Optimal pain management is based on a holistic approach which includes the set up of a proper pain diagnosis according to the child’s individual needs and its developmental level and it considers both pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions.Advances in Paediatric Emergency CareP BibanNeonatal and Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Major City Hospital, Verona, ItalyAbstract not available at the time of printing.Assessing the Level of Consciousness in Children: A Plea for the Glasgow Coma Motor SubscoreP Van de Voorde1, D Lutman2, M Peters31Paediatric ICU, University Hospital Gent, Belgium, 2CATS, Children’s Acute Transport Service, London, UK, 3Paediatric ICU, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, London, UKBackground and AimsThe Glasgow Coma Scale is not always easy to score and its reliability has been questioned. We hypothesised that the Motor subscore would be at least as effective in predicting outcome from coma in children.MethodsCATS provides emergency secondary transport of critically ill children (UK). During a 9-month period we studied all patients with altered consciousness, not caused by drugs, chronic disease, convulsions or cardio-respiratory failure. For each case we collected the GCS at referral or pre-intubation. Outcome was evaluated upon discharge using a three level ordinal scale (adapted from Fiser DH, J. Ped. 1992; 121:68–74).Value of Repeat CT Scanning for Investigation of Intractable Intracranial Hypertension in Traumatic Brain InjuryL E Loh, Q MokPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsPatients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) frequently require urgent repeat CT scans to determine if there is a surgically treatable cause for their intractable intracranial hypertension. This involves transfer of the ventilated patient from the intensive care unit to the scanning suite, with its antecedent risks. The aim of the study was to determine how frequently these CT scans showed abnormalities where surgery could have improved intracranial hypertension refractory to medical intervention, and if there were clinical parameters that could predict this.MethodsThis was a retrospective study of patients admitted to our tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with TBI requiring intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring. Patient notes, computerised observation charts and CT scans were reviewed. Scans were reported independently by neuroradiologists not involved in the patients’ clinical care.The Influence of Pre-cardiopulmonary Cerebral Resuscitation Factors on Survival Rate in ChildrenG van Berlaer, V Van Gorp, S Hachimi-IdrissiDepartment of Pediatric Critical Care, Academical Hospital, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, BelgiumBackground and AimsThe outcome of children after resuscitation for cardiopulmonary arrest is poor. Our aim is to describe a large pediatric population who developed a pre-hospital cardiopulmonary arrest (PCPA) and to outline the influence of the pre-cardiopulmonary cerebral resuscitation (CPCR) factors on survival rate. An evaluation is made of the influence of applied CPCR guidelines on these children’s outcome.MethodsFrom 1991 till 2005, clinical records of all patients younger than 16 years with PCPA were reviewed. All data were prospectively registered using a uniform standard registry, and adjusted to the Utstein style report. The studied pre-CPCR factors were restricted to age, site and cause of PCPA, bystander CPCR, time to intubation and to administration of drugs, initial cardiac rhythm and respiratory pattern on arrival of the mobile intensive care unit team.Transport of Newborns with Acute Lung Failure on ECMOF Loersch, S T Hien, M Kratz, S Demirakca, C H v. Buch, S T Loff, T H SchaibleNICU, University Childrens Hospital, Mannheim, GermanyBackground and AimsAlthough ventilation and postpartal management of sick newborns has been optimized, ECMO remains a therapeutic option in the neonatal intensive care of acute lung failure. The ECMO-center Mannheim has performed about 281 ECMO cases since 1987, and currently performs about 25 ECMOs per year. 50 infants per year are evaluated for the option of ECMO therapy. Half of them are born at the center and the others are transported to the ECMO center. Some children are too ill for conventional transport, in which case transport using mobile ECMO is necessary.Infants Transferred for Consideration of Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS): Predictors for ECLS RequirementL Mills1, S Rodger1, M Liddell2, J Simpson2, C Davis2, C Skeoch1, L Jackson11West of Scotland Neonatal Transport Service, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK, 2Extra Corporeal Life Support Service, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UKBackground and AimsECLS is an established therapy for neonates with a high-risk of death from respiratory failure and is available in 4 UK centres. No standardised criteria for initiating ECLS transfer exist although the oxygenation index (OI) has been used historically. To review factors influencing the decision to commence ECLS for infants transferred to Glasgow as potential candidates for ECLS.MethodsA retrospective case note review incorporating the West of Scotland Neonatal Transport Database. Factors influencing ECLS requirement were identified using bi-variate correlation. Binary logistic regression was used to identify independent determinants of ECLS requirement.

Most of these diseases manifest during (early) childhood and affect the nervous system more often than any other organ system. Early diagnosis is important because treatment, if available, may prevent acute metabolic attacks and mental retardation, epilepsy, severe brain damage, or death; and is also a prerequisite for optimal genetic counselling. The ideal classification of metabolic encephalopathies should be based on cause and pathogenesis. In a recent paper (Ref.: A. Simons, F. Eyskens et al. European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2006) we reported on the intelligence scores and the psychiatric pathology of distinct groups of children with metabolic diseases. Based on this study I would divide the neurometabolic disorders roughly in different subgroups: the “intoxication group1” (including PKU, galactosemia, organic acidurias and urea cycle disorders), the “substrate and enzymatic disorders of energy metabolism group” (including glycogenoses, neoglucogenesis and fatty acid oxidation disorders that have hypoglycaemia in common), the “mitochondrial respiratory chain defects group”, the “storage disorders group” and the”deficiency disorders group”. This rough classification based on pathophysiologic processes provides insight in the different mechanisms giving rise to metabolic encephalopathies.MethodsThe study population of the referred paper consisted of 53 children between 0 and 18 years of age. Diagnostic assessment included a semi-structured interview, self-report questionnaires and a standard intelligence test. Case reports of different metabolic diseases not included in the paper will be discussed: Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia, Canavan’s Disease, peroxisomal disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, Smith-Lemly-Opitz syndrome, Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis, CDG syndrome, L-serine biosynthesis defects, disorders of creatine metabolism, folate receptor antibodies, pyridoxine dependency, and neurotransmitter defects. Besides functional disturbances, developmental structural brain defects, neuronal and glial cell loss, demyelination / leucodystrophy and stroke or stroke-like injury to the brain are common in metabolic diseases. NMR imaging of the brain can reveal specific abnormalities, e.g. Leigh syndrome and Canavan’s disease, as well as aspecific abnormalities, e.g. corpus callosum agenesia/hypoplasia and neuronal migratory disturbances. Special extraneural abnormalities should be looked for: dysmorphic features, cardiac involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, skin disturbances,…Effect of Fetal Growth Restriction on Body Composition and Hormonal Status at Birth in Infants of Small And Appropriate-For-Gestational Age Birth WeightR Verkauskiene1, J Beltrand1, O Claris2, D Chevenne3, O Sibony4, P Gaucherand5, C Lévy-Marchal11INSERM U690, Hôital Robert Debré, Paris, France 2Department of Neonatology, Hôital Eduard Heriot, Lyon, France, 3Department of Biochemistry, Hôital Robert Debré, Paris, France, 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hôital Robert Debré, Paris, France 5Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hôital Eduard Heriot, Lyon, FranceBackground and AimsIntrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) has been related to several health risks, generally identified in small-for-gestational age (SGA) individuals. We aimed to evaluate the impact of IUGR on body composition and hormonal status in newborns of small and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) birthweight.Methods4 monthly ultrasound examinations were performed in 145 women at risk of IUGR. Intrauterine growth slope (IUGS) was calculated as fetal weight percentiles change and IUGR defined as its reduction by more than 20 percentiles. SGA was defined as birthweight below the 10th percentile. Newborns were stratified into 4 groups: SGA-IUGR (n=27), ‘constitutional’ SGA (SGA-C, n=21), AGA-IUGR (n=42) and ‘constitutional’ AGA (AGA-C, n=55). Cord insulin and IGF-I concentrations were determined. DEXA scan was performed at postnatal day 3.Maternal Insulin Sensitivity in Mid-pregnancy and Fetal GrowthR Verkauskiene1, J Beltrand1, O Claris2, D Chevenne3, O Sibony4, P Gaucherand5, C Lévy-Marchal11INSERM U690, Hôital Robert Debré, Paris, France 2Department of Neonatology, Hôital Eduard Heriot, Lyon, France, 3Department of Biochemistry, Hôital Robert Debré, Paris, France, 4Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hôital Robert Debré, Paris, France 5Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Hôital Eduard Heriot, Lyon, FranceBackground and AimsThe pathway linking intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes is still not clear. We hypothesised that maternal insulin sensitivity could be related to fetal growth pattern.MethodsFetal growth was estimated by four monthly ultrasound examinations from 22 to 36 gestational weeks (GW) in 145 women with normal glucose tolerance. IUGR was defined as a reduction in estimated fetal weight by more than 20 percentiles. Small or appropriate-for-gestational age (SGA/AGA) size was defined as birthweight below/superior the 10th percentile, respectively. At birth, infants were stratified into 4 groups: SGA-IUGR (n=27), ‘constitutional’ SGA (SGA-C, n=21), AGA-IUGR (n=42) and ‘constitutional’ AGA (AGA-C, n=55). Maternal fasting insulin and glycaemia were determined at 22–24 GW. IGF-I and insulin were measured in cord blood. DEXA scan in newborns was performed at postnatal day 3.Placental Ghrelin Release in the Dual in Vitro Perfusion ModelK Linnemann1, C Anders1, K May1, C Müller1, R Trollmann2, J Dösch2, W Straube3, C Fusch11Department of Neonatology and Pediatric Intensive Care, University of Greifswald, Germany, 2Department of Pediatrics, University of Erlangen, Germany, 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Greifswald, GermanyBackground and AimsGhrelin stimulates GH release and appetite, modulates carbohydrate metabolism and insulin secretion and ultimately influences energy balance and fat storage in the human body. The human placenta expresses ghrelin at the mRNA level. It remains unclear if the placenta releases ghrelin, a possibly important growth factor for fetal growth into the fetal or maternal circulation. Aim: Investigation of placental ghrelin release into the fetal or maternal circulation.Methods14 placentas at term; dual in vitro placenta perfusion for 6h for determination of ghrelin-, hCG- and leptin- release; and glucose consumption, lactate production, creatinine transfer (controls for normal placental function). Ghrelin mRNA was measured by quantitative PCR.Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthetase Polymorphisms as a Risk Factor for Necrotizing Enterocolitis in Premature InfantsR M J Moonen1, M E Rubio1, N Y P Souren2, A D C Paulussen2, E Villamor11Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Maastricht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Population Genetics, University of Maastricht, Maastricht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsPlasma L-arginine concentrations were found to be lower in preterm infants who developed necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Term infants who were homozygous (CC) for a C-to-A nucleotide transversion (T1405N) in the gene-encoding carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase I (CPSI) had lower L-arginine concentrations than infants with the AA genotype (Pearson et al., N Engl J Med 2001; 344:1832–8). The present study tests the hypothesis that this functional polymorphism in CPSI would be related to NEC in preterm infants.MethodsGenotypes of the CPSI variants were determined in 16 preterm infants with NEC (Bell stage II or greater, gestational age ≤ 30 wk), 29 preterm infants without NEC (gestational age ≤ 30 wk) and 25 healthy term infants.Leptin and Adiponectin Plasma Levels in Intrauterine Growth Restricted (IUGR) and Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA) Fetuses, Neonates and Their MothersM Kyriakakou1, A Malamitsi-Puchner1, H Militsi2, T Boutsikou1, D Hassiakos1, A Margeli2, I Papassotiriou2, G Mastorakos1, C Kanaka-Gantenbein31Second Dept of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Athens University Medical School, 2Dept of Clinical Biochemistry, “Aghia Sophia” Children’s Hospital, Athens, Greece, 3First Dept of Pediatrics, Athens University Medical School, GreeceBackground and AimsLeptin regulates energy balance and exerts an insulin sensitizing effect, while adiponectin increases insulin action in muscle and liver and exerts anti-atherogenic effects. This study investigated the release of these two adipocytokines in the blood of mothers (MP), and their single IUGR or AGA fetuses (UC) and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4) postnatally.MethodsPlasma levels of adipocytokines were measured by radioimmunoassays (LINCO Research, USA) in 20 IUGR and 20 AGA mother-infant sets.Serum Osteoprotegerin and Rankl Concentrations in the Perinatal Period: The Impact of Intrauterine Growth RestrictionD Briana1, A Malamitsi-Puchner1, D Gourgiotis2, M Boutsikou1, L Kontara1, A Marmarinos2, S Baka1, T Boutsikou1, D Hassiakos11Neonatal Division, 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Athens University, Greece, 2Research Laboratories, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Athens University, GreeceBackground and AimsRANKL (receptor activator of NF-κB ligand) belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family and is crucial for osteoclast formation. Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a member of the TNF receptor superfamily inhibits osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption. This study aimed to investigate RANKL and OPG in full term intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR-below the 10th customized centile) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses (UC) and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4) postpartum, as well as in their mothers (MS) before delivery.MethodsRANKL and OPG were measured by enzyme immunoassays in the serum of 20 IUGR and 20 AGA mother-infant sets.Adrenal Stress Response in Preterm Infants of More 6han 30 Weeks Gestational Age Determined by Urinary Excretion Rates of Glucocorticoids MetabolitesM Heckmann1, M F Hartmann1, B Grofer1, R H Boedeker2, S A Wudy11Department of General Pediatrics and Neonatology, Center of Child and Adolescent Medicine, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, Germany, 2Institute of Medical Statistics, Justus Liebig University, Giessen, GermanyBackground and AimsThe aim was to investigate urinary excretion rates of glucocorticoid metabolites (GM) in well and ill preterm infants (PI) &gt; 30 wks.MethodsIllness severity was measured by the score for neonatal acute physiology (SNAP). GM were profiled by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 24-h urinary samples.

The overall compliance with hand hygiene is considered to be poor in different studies and difficult to enhance. A multifaceted campaign showed to be the best way to improve the behavior towards hand hygiene. We evaluated the effectiveness of an education program on compliance with hand hygiene in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).MethodsThe study was performed on the NICU (level IV) of Erasmus MC — Sophia Children’s Hospital. The education program (intervention) was based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, the observed practice prior to the intervention and the Theory of Planned Behavior (attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control). An interrupted time series study was performed by guided observations of hygienic behavior of health care workers. The mean dry time after disinfection and the amount of used hand alcohol were measured. Two pre-intervention observations took place in the period January 2005 – May 2005 and the first post-intervention observations took place in the period December 2005 – March 2006.Epidemiology of Invasive Fungal Infection in a PicuR Chhabra, P Maheshwari, M Nolan, S Nadel, D P InwaldPICU, St Mary’s Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsTo determine the incidence and risk factors for invasive fungal infection in our Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).MethodsCase records of patients admitted from August 2002 to August 2005 were reviewed. Data collected included underlying medical condition, site of infection, associated bacterial and viral infections, antimicrobial and antifungal treatment and mortality.Predicting Severe Bacterial Infection in Infants and Children with Fever Without a SourceB Andreola, S Bressan, S Callegaro, M Soligo, T Zangardi, L Da DaltDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Padova, ItalyBackground and AimsFever without a source (FWS) is a common reason for children to visit the Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) and it remains a challenge for the clinician to early detect severe bacterial infections (SBI). Our aims were to assess the incidence of SBI in an unselected population of children &lt; 36 months attending our PED and to compare the performance of different biological markers in detecting these infections.MethodsOver a 12 months period all children aged 7 days — 36 months admitted for FWS were prospectively included. Patients underwent diagnostic tests according to the guidelines in use. Clinical and laboratory parameters — C-Reactive Protein (CRP), White Blood Cell (WBC) count, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) — were collected and compared in relationship to microbiological results. Specificity, sensitivity, multilevel likelihood ratios and ROC curve analysis were calculated.Oropharyngeal Colonization By Gram Negative Pathogens And Oral Care Of Critically Ill ChildrenM L G Pedreira1, L T S Santos1, D M Kusahara1, M A S Peterlini1, A C C Pignatari2, A M O Machado31Department of Nursing, Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil, 2Infectious and Parasitary Disease, Federal University of São Paulo, Brazil, 3Microbiology Laboratory, Federal University of São Paulo, BrazilBackground and AimsMore than 60% of VAP episodes are related to aerobic gram negative bacteria, predominantly Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. The pathogenesis of VAP can be related to bacteria translocation from oropharynx to tracheobronchial tree. The aim of the study was to describe characteristics of gram negative pathogens colonization of children’s oropharyngeal secretion, through different oral care methods.MethodsProspective randomized controlled study realized in a University Hospital PICU in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The study was approved by the ethics research committee. The sample was composed of 56 children, 29 (51.8%) in Control Group-CG (nonpharmacological intervention) and 27 (48.2%) in Experimental Group-EG (0.12% chlorhexidine). Microbiological cultures of oropharyngeal were obtained 24, 48 and 96 hours after admission and analyzed according to bacterial identification data and antimicrobial resistance.Prevalence of Allergic Rhinitis in Population of School-Age ChildrenL D Jorjoliani1, N M Adamia2, N S Manjavidze2, Z A Charkviani2, I K Babilashvili21Dept of Allergology and Clinical Immunology, Institute of Pediatrics, 2Dept of Pediatrics, Tbilisi State Medical University, Tbilisi, GeorgiaBackground and AimsPurpose of the work was to study prevalence of allergic rhinitis and clinical-allergic peculiarities of allergic rhinitis together with bronchial asthma in population of school-age children in Tbilisi.MethodsThe researches were conducted based on questioning of random and representative groups of school-age children, by the cross-section method of epidemiologic research. At the first stage of research work, there were questioned 3000 children from 6 to 17; at the second stage clinical-allergological researches were conducted with 256 randomly selected children with the signs of rhinitis.Occurrence of Withdrawal Symptoms in Critically ILL Children after Long-term Administration of Sedatives and/or AnalgesicsE Ista1, M van Dijk2, D Tibboel2, M de Hoog11Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsVentilated, critically ill children commonly receive sedative and analgesic drugs to ease their mental burden, anxiety and pain, induced by frightening or painful interventions and environmental factors in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Intravenous opioids (such as morphine and fentanyl) and benzodiazepines (such as midazolam) are the most used drugs for this purpose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid tapering off after long-term administration may lead to problems of tolerance, physiological or psychological dependence and withdrawal symptoms. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of withdrawal symptoms and the correlation between total doses of benzodiazepine or opioids and withdrawal symptoms.MethodsThis prospective study was performed in children admitted to the PICU of the Erasmus MC — Sophia Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. Patients were included if midazolam and/or opioids were administrated for more than 5 days. Withdrawal symptoms were assessed using the Sophia Benzodiazepine &amp; Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SBOWS), which includes all withdrawal symptoms described in the pediatric literature. Withdrawal symptoms were observed by the caregiving nurse.How Reliable do we Assess Pain in the Long Run?J Kats, H de Graaf, M van DijkPediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Erasmus MC-Sophia’s Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn 1999 our Pediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit implemented the COMFORT behavior scale in daily practice combined with a treatment algorithm. All nurses were trained in pain assessment and each had to perform ten assessments with a trained nurse to determine interrater reliability using the linearly weighted Cohen’s Kappa. Since than pain assessment became standard of care with. In 2004 and 2005 14787 combined COMFORT behavior and Visual Analogue Scale pain scores were assessed in 612 patients. Although from the outside this seemed satisfactory we questioned the (interrater) reliability of scoring by the nurses. This study aimed to determine current interrater reliability.MethodsNurses assessed COMFORT behavior and a Numeric Rating for pain and distress at bedside. Linearly weighted Cohen’s Kappa was calculated and compared with the previous one in eight nurses. In addition the Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for COMFORT total score and NRS pain and distress was calculated.Analgesic Effect of TV Watching during VenipunctureC V Bellieni, G Morgese, G Buonocore, S PerroneDepartment of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproduction Medicine, University of Siena, ItalyBackground and AimsWe know the importance of parents’ collaboration in helping children to cope with pain by their presence and distraction. We recently successfully used this approach in neonatal analgesia. We also know the capturing power of television on children. The difference between these two approaches is that the former is active and involves affectivity, though fear may be transmitted to the child, whereas the latter is passive. Our aim was to assess the analgesic effect of active and passive distraction (parent and television) during venipuncture.MethodsWe studied 69 children aged 7–12 years undergoing venipuncture. The children were randomly divided into three groups: a control group (C) without any distraction procedure, a group TV in which passive distraction was used, using a TV cartoon, and a group M in which mothers performed active distraction. Both mothers and children scored pain after the procedure.Bis-Guided Sedation Versus Standard Practice in the Paediatric Intensive Care UnitA S Ramelet1,2, A W Duncan3, L Flynn31Nursing Research, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, Australia, 2School of Nursing and Midwifery, Curtin University of Technology, Perth, Australia, 3Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, AustraliaBackground and AimsThe Bispectral index (BIS) is a processed EEG parameter that indicates the hypnotic effects of anaesthetic and sedative agents on the brain. BIS may be useful in achieving optimal level of sedation and preventing oversedation in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patient. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical utility of the Bispectral index (BIS) monitoring in titrating sedative agents when compared with Standard Practice (SP) and to determine the correlation of the BIS and the level of sedation, using the Modified Motor Activity Assessment Scale (MMAAS).MethodsThis single blind randomised controlled study was conducted in the paediatric intensive care unit of a tertiary referral hospital in Western Australia. Following parental consent, ventilated children requiring sedation were randomly assigned to the BIS-guided sedation group or the control group (standard practice).Sleep Disturbances in Children Hospitalized in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU)R Shehadeh1, S Anson2, G Bar-Joseph1, M Halbertal1, R Beck1, S Suraya1, G Pillar11Rambam Medical Center and Technion Institute of Technology, Haifa, Israel, 2Ben-Gurion University of The Negev, Beer Sheva, IsraelBackground and AimsSleep is of great importance to hospitalized patients. Sleep facilitates recovery. PICU’s are characterized by intense activity day and night; the work of the nursing staff involves noise and requires light, which may result in sleep disturbances. The purpose of this study was to evaluate sleep disturbances in the PICU. MethodsSleep patterns of 30 children were monitored by Actigraphy and Manual sound level meter from 7pm till 7am the next morning. Factors may interrupt sleep were monitored. Results: Thirty children (19M/11F) were observed. All were fully conscious, not treated by any hypnotics or sedatives and no history of sleep disorders. Their mean age was 6±4 years. Average total sleep time was 4±2 hours, with a sleep efficiency of 40±21%. A significant negative correlation existed between sleep efficiency and the nursing staff activity level (r= −0.53, p&lt;0.05), total general activities (r= −0.51, p&lt;0.05), light above the patient (r= −0.73, p&lt;0.001), the instrumentation level (r= −0.56, p&lt;0.001) and the average noise level (r= −0.74, p&lt;0.001). Similarly, total sleep time correlated negatively with these factors (r= −0.49, −0.39, −0.48 and −0.62, p&lt;0.05 for all. Hallucinatory Experiences Reported by Children Following an Intensive Care AdmissionG A Colville1, H Tighe2, C M Pierce21Paediatric Psychology Service, St George’s Hospital 2PICU, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsOur aim was to establish, by direct interview, the extent and nature of children’s hallucinations following a paediatric intensive care (PIC) admission. We hypothesized that the association between delusional memories and posttraumatic stress reported in adult intensive care survivors would also apply to children.MethodsThe setting was a 20 bed general PIC unit in a tertiary referral Children’s Hospital. Children (n=102), aged 7 – 17y, were interviewed 3 months after discharge using the ICU Memory Tool (Jones et al 2000) and the CRIES PTSD scale (Perrin et al 2005).Therapy of Persistent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infants — Why, When and How?A H G Von Der WenseDepartment of Neonatology and Paediatric Intensive Care, Altonaer Kinderkrankenhaus, Hamburg, GermanyBackground and AimsPatency of the ductus arteriosus (PDA) is one of the most frequent problems complicating the clinical course of very low and especially extreme low birth weight infants (VLBW, ELBW). Thus a large number of preventive, prophylactic or therapeutic strategies have been developed over the last 30 years to minimize the incidence of PDA and its potentially harmful consequences. Recent clinical trials and metaanalyses will be discussed concerning efficacy in closure of PDA as well as side effects of pharmacological treatment and long-term outcome variables.MethodsLiterature Review and Prospective Cohort Study in the Hamburg Ibuprofen Trial.Ibuprofen Treatment of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infant, Experience from StockholmS JohanssonDepartment of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockhom, SwedenBackground and AimsIbuprofen treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was introduced at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden in 2001. During the years 2001 to 2004 clinical data was prospectively collected on all infant treated with ibuprofen, to assess renal function and clinical outcome.Methods83 infants (mean gestational age 27 weeks, standard deviation 2 weeks) with echocardiographic PDA-diagnosis received 98 courses of ibuprofen (10+5+5 mg/kg). Renal function and water balance were measured by urinary output and s-creatinine, s-urea and s-sodium. Short term closure was assessed by echocardiography 18–24 hours after completed ibuprofen course. Surgical closure rate was assessed at discharge. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was defined as need of supplementary oxygen at 36 postconceptional age.Ibuprofen, Bilirubin and Albumin: The Importance of a BalanceB Van OvermeireNeonatology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Antwerp University Hospital, BelgiumIbuprofen at a dosing scheme of 10-5-5 mg/kg at 24 hour intervals is increasingly used as an alternative to indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. Because ibuprofen is highly bound to albumin it may interfere with bilirubin-albumin binding and increase the free fraction of bilirubin, augmenting the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity.A large interindividual variation in ibuprofen pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated in newborns. One hour after the first dose, ibuprofen plasma levels are reported to vary from 31 to 280 mg/L. Ibuprofen is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 complex and more specifically by the CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 subfamily. Maturation of CYP2C increases fast after birth, reaching 30% of adult activity by one month of age. Ibuprofen clearance is highly variable among individual neonates and increases with advancing postnatal age. Ibuprofen serum half-lives decreased from 43 hours at age 3 days to 27 hours at age 5 days. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics may also be influenced by the presence of a ductal shunt. The volume of distribution changed more pronounced in infants with a closing ductus.Ibuprofen is 95% bound to albumin and may interfere with bilirubin-albumin binding, thereby increasing the free fraction of bilirubin and induce a higher risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. High ibuprofen serum levels have been shown to have comparable displacing effects on free bilirubin as sulfizoxazole, a drug that has caused bilirubin encephalopathy in neonatal infants. Free bilirubin is superior to total bilirubin concentration in predicting the risk for bilirubin toxicity. The risk of inducing kernicterus depends on the concentration of ibuprofen, the binding constants of albumin for ibuprofen and bilirubin, and the bilirubin load at the moment when ibuprofen is administered. Albumin-ibuprofen binding is variable between neonates and probably also changes in time. On the first day after birth the biliubin pool is usually low, but increases steadily in the first week of life. In many neonatal intensive care units patent ductus arteriosus is preferentially treated when first signs of left to right ductal shunt develop, typically at the moment when the bilirubin pool is increased.Several methods for the measurement of free bilirubin, or indirectly by the assessment of albumin binding, were developed. Recently an improved peroxidase assay has been developed with minimal serum dilution and two enzyme concentrations, yielding more accurate results.In order to better understand the interactions between ibuprofen, albumin and bilirubin, the concentration of these molecules were analysed in plasma simultaneously with free bilirubin levels, before and after the administration of successive doses of ibuprofen in neonates of varying gestational and postnatal age with patent ductus arteriosus. The infants were followed-up after discharge and were screened for possible hearing deficits. No significant changes of free bilirubin concentrations were observed after the administration of ibuprofen. There was no correlation between these changes and the increase of ibuprofen levels. Free bilirubin increased inversely proportional to birth weight.No clinical signs of bilirubin neurotoxicity could be detected in surviving infants.First results seem to demonstrate that the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy is not increased after treatment with ibuprofen at a dosing scheme of 10-5-5 mg/kg, with peak levels below 60 mg/L and total bilirubin concentrations below 10mg/dL. However, when higher doses are applied in sick infants, the risk of kernicterus may markedly increase.Clinical and Immunological Effects of the Long-Term Dietary Supplementation with a Probiotic Fermented Milk in Pre-School Children Allergic to InhalantsF Salvini1, L Morelli2, A Ruscitto1, G Radaelli1, D Cattivelli2, C Agostoni1, M Giovannini11Department of Paediatrics, University of Milan, San Paolo Hospital, Milan, Italy, 2Microbiology Institute, Universitá Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, ItalBackground and AimsProbiotics may have immunomodulatory functions, exerting beneficial effects in allergic disease. We investigated whether prolonged daily consumption of Lactobacillus casei DN- 114 001 fermented milk improve clinical and immunological condition of children aged 3–6 years allergic to inhalants.MethodsIn a randomised-controlled multicentric trial patients were randomly assigned to receive for one year 100 ml per day of L. casei DN-114 001 fermented milk (109 cells/ml), or no probiotics (controls). Clinical evaluations occurred every 3 months. Faecal flora composition was assessed every 6 months (30 treated, 15 controls). Outcome measures were allergy-related signs incidence, infections incidence/severity, IgE-G-A serological levels (baseline vs 12 months).21 Months Old Infants are Leaner if their Mothers Received Low Dose DHA Supplements during Pregnancy and LactationR L Bergmann1, R Richter1, K E Bergmann1, J W Dudenhausen1, F Haschke21Charité University Hospitals, Berlin, Germany, 2Nestlé Nutrition Institute, Vevey, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsThe supply of LC-PUFAs to the foetus and infant is associated with growth. Our aim was to study the growth of children whose mothers had received a vitamin-mineral-supplement during pregnancy and lactation with additional docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) compared to those without DHA-supplement.MethodsAt 22 weeks of gestation 144 mothers were enrolled to a randomised controlled double blind clinical trial on the effects of a daily intake of a vitamin-mineral supplement up to 37 weeks and voluntarily up to 3 months of lactation. 0.2 g DHA was added to one supplement (DHA-group). Of the 116 term newborns, measured at ages 1 and 3 months, finally 69 children (no significant selection bias) were followed up to 21 months. For statistical analysis of their growth (length, weight, BMI, head circumference) linear mixed models were used.Growth of Infants Born from HIV Positive Mothers Fed with Acidified Starter Formula Containing Bifidobacterium LactisP A Cooper1, M Mokhachane1, K D Bolton1, P Steenhout2, C Hager31Department of Paediatrics, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa, 2Nestle Nutrition, Nestec Ltd., Vevey, Switzerland, 3Nestle Research Center, Nestec Ltd., Lausanne, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsThe choice of formula for infants born to HIV positive mothers in developing countries who choose not to breast feed must be made with the aim of ensuring the least risk of infection and optimal growth. We investigated the effects of acidification and addition of probiotics in two separate but similar studies. MethodsFull term healthy infants born to HIV positive mothers who had decided not to breast feed were randomized within a week of birth to either a standard starter formula, an acidified starter formula or an acidified formula containing probiotics (Bifido-bacterium lactis 2 × 107 cfu/g). The studies were double blind and anthropometric measurements were analyzed up to age 4 months. Effect of Dietary Supplementation with LC-Pufa, an Oligosaccharide Mix and L. Paracasei CNCM I-2116 on Growth of Neonatal Stress RatsC L Garcia Rodenas1, M Moser2, G Bergonzelli11Dept of Nutrition and Health, 2Dept of Analytical Bioscience, Nestle Research Center, Lausanne, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsCatch-up growth is essential in preterm infants to ensure adequate development. However, high rates of catch-up growth in early life may increase the risk of obesity later on. We had previously established that a blend of ingredients increased growth recovery after neonatal stress in rats. We aimed to: 1) Identify the ingredient(s) responsible for this effect, and 2) Determine whether the nutritional intervention affected body composition.MethodsRat pups were exposed to intermittent maternal deprivation from postnatal days 2 to 14. After precocious weaning, pups were fed from day 15 till day 35 with either a control diet or a similar diet adapted to contain either LC-PUFA, inulin + galactooligosaccharides, L. paracasei CNCM I-2116 or a blend containing all ingredients. Animals from the nonstressed control group were weaned at day 21 and fed with the control diet until day 35.Growth of Infants Fed a Starter Formula Containing Bifidobacterium Longum BL999 and a Mixture of PrebioticsG Puccio1, C Cajozzo1, P Steenhout2, F Rochat2, M C Fichot2, F Meli11Neonatologia, Istituto di Ostetricia e Ginecologia Dell’Università di Palermo, Italy, 2Nestlé Nutrition, Nestec Ltd., Vevey, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsThe aim was to evaluate the effects on growth, tolerance and effects on morbidity of a new starter formula containing a probiotic (B longum BL999) and prebiotics.Methods138 healthy newborns were enrolled and randomized in a prospective double blind study and follow-up to 4 months of age. 69 newborns received the experimental formula containing a probiotic (Bifidobacterium longum ATCC BAA-999, — 2×107 cfu/g) and 4 g/L of a mixture of prebiotics (10% short chain FOS, 90% GOS). The other 69 received a commercially available formula (Nané). Both formulas contained LC-Pufas.Normocaloric Enriched Formula after Term Does not Affect Growth and Body Composition in Preterm InfantsE M Amesz1, A Schaafsma2, H N Lafeber11Departments of Pediatrics and Neonatology, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Research and Development, Friesland Foods, Leeuwarden, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsProtein and mineral enriched post discharge formula probably improves growth of preterm infants. Differences in growth predominantly seem to develop in the first weeks after discharge. Until what age this formula is beneficial and whether the body composition is influenced is unclear. Growth and body composition of preterm infants fed enriched formula until term or 6 months corrected age (CA) are compared.MethodsAt term, preterm infants (bw ≤ 1500 gram and/or ga ≤ 32 weeks) were randomized to a post discharge formula (n=30, PDF) or a term formula (n=26, TF). A control group of 12 infants was exclusively breast fed until at least 3 months CA (BM). Until term, all infants received preterm formula or fortified breast milk. Anthropometry was performed at 0, 3 and 6 months CA. Body composition was measured by DXA at 0 and 6 months CA.Genes And RdsM HallmanDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, FinlandBackground and AimsRespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a multifactorial developmental disease caused by lung immaturity and presenting as high-permeability lung edema (“hyaline membrane disease”). It is characterized by a transient deficiency of alveolar surfactant during the first week of life and a secondary lung injury. During the first few days of life, the alveolar surfactant pool size increases in size, reaching the controls within the first week.MethodsHere we describe the approach how to define the genetic contribution to disease and discuss the polymorphisms some genes that associate with respiratory disease. The candidate genes studied thus far have been chosen on the basis of phenotype respiratory failure in lack-of-function mutations involving genes encoding surfactant proteins (SP) (SP-B, SP-C), on the basis of the regulatory role in the surfactant metabolism and in the host defense (SP-A), and on the basis of the established relationship to another generalized lung disease (G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility, GPR154 alias GPRA).Genes And ArdsJ-D ChicheFranceAbstract not available at the time of printing.Placental Adenoviral Genome PCR Detection and Placental Histology in Preterm and Term DeliveriesE A Tsekoura1, A Konstantinidou2, D Kafetzis1, N Spanakis3, S Papadopoulou3, D Yfanti3, N Nikolaidis4, A Tsakris3, A Antsaklis51Department of Paediatrics, Medical School, University of Athens, Greece, 2Department of Pathology, Medical School, University of Athens, Greece, 3Department of Microbiology, Medical School, University of Athens, Athens, Greece, 4NICU Department, Papageorgiou Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece, 51st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, ‘Alexandra’ Maternity Hospital, Medical School University of Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsIntrauterine infection is an important cause of spontaneous preterm birth. However, evidence based etiology of viral infection is still lacking. This study aims to test the hypothesis that detection of adenovirus in placenta tissue is associated with preterm birth and to determine the placental histopathological findings.MethodsPlacentas were collected from 193 deliveries, 71 premature deliveries and 122 at term. Detection of adenovirus genome was tested by PCR assay. Placental histology and immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibody CD45 were evaluated for signs of inflammatory reaction in the positive for adenovirus samples.Impaired Cellular Immunity May Explain Higher Incidence And Severity Of Respiratory Tract Infections In Children With Down SyndromeC J M Broers, R J B J Gemke, S G M Lamers, M E Weijerman, A M van FurthDepartment of Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsChildren with Down syndrome have an increased susceptibility to infections, probably due to an altered cellular and humoral immune response. In this study the frequency of infections and hospitalization of children with Down syndrome was compared to healthy sibs and related to differences in their cellular immunity.MethodsParents of 62 children with Down syndrome and 57 of their healthy sibs were interviewed about the frequency of infections and hospitalizations due to infection. Also T-cell characteristics were analysed in both groups.Neonatal Respiratory Distress: Changes over 30 Years in a Geographically Defined PopulationM Roth-Kleiner1, J Ersch2, P Baeckert3, H U Bucher21Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois, Lausanne, Switzerland, 2Clinic of Neonatology, University Hospital of Zurich, Switzerland, 3Spital Bethanien, Zurich, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsTo evaluate trends of neonatal respiratory distress (RD) regarding incidence, treatment and mortality in a geographically defined population over 30 years.MethodsA questionnaire was sent to all primary, secondary and tertiary neonatal units in Switzerland every ten years between 1974 and 2004 asking for the number of hospitalized patients with RD and hyaline membrane disease (HMD), their treatment and mortality. RD was defined as the presence of two of the following symptoms for more than 15 minutes: tachypnoe (&gt;60/min), nasal flaring, retractions, central cyanosis in room air and expiratory grunting.A Two Centre Genetic Association Study in Picu Children with and without SirsK M Illing1, V J Pappachan1, M L Allen3, M J Rose-Zerill2, R Agbeko3, H Rutkowska1, K Cathie1, T G Coulson1, P Wilson1, J W Holloway2, M J Peters31Peadiatric Intensive Care Unit, Southampton General Hospital, Southampton, UK, 2Infection, Inflammation and Repair Division, University of Southampton, Southampton, UK, 3Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, UKBackground and AimsThe incidence of SIRS may have a genetic predisposition. Functionally significant polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding Macrophage Inhibitory Factor (MIF: −173) the RAGE receptor (AGER 374A) the TLR4 receptor (+896A) were studied in children admitted to 2 PICUs after informed consent and LREC approval.. All of these SNPs down regulate the host’s ability to mount an inflammatory response and should be more prevalent in children without SIRS.MethodsA total of 225 children from 2 centres were recruited. Phenotype/genotype relationships were analysed (225 children) using Pearson χ2 statistics. Phenotype was defined by the presence or absence of SIRS as well as SOFA, PELOD and PIM scores. Genotyping was performed using Taqman™ PCR.New Evidences of Genotype-Phenotype Correlations in Metachromatic LeukodystrophyA Biffi1,2, M Cesani1, U Del Carro3, F Fumagalli2,3, C Baldoli4, S Gerevini4, M Falautano5, S Canale5, G Comi2,3, M G Roncarolo1,2, M Sessa1,31San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy, Pediatric Clinical Research Unit (HSR-TIGET PCRU), San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, 2Vita Salute University, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, 3Neurology Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, 4Neuroradiology Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, 5Neuropsychology Unit, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, ItalyBackground and AimsMetachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) is a rare and fatal demyelinating lysosomal storage disorder, due to the inherited deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Currently no valid therapeutic options are available for affected patients. Previously described correlations between clinical presentation and either residual enzymatic activity or common mutations resulted respectively poorly informative or helpful in predicting patient’s prognosis only in a minority of MLD patients harboring common mutations.MethodsWe analyzed the complete ARSA gene in 23 MLD patients that we followed with periodical clinical and instrumental evaluations.Privacy And Confidentiality In The Care Of ChildrenM WeindlingLiverpool Womens Hospital, Liverpool, UKAbstract not available at the time of printing.The Declaration of HelsinkiF P CrawleyGood Clinical Practice Alliance — Europe and Member, Ethics Working Group, Confederation of European Specialists in Paediatrics, Kessel-Lo, BelgiumThe Declaration of Helsinki (1964–2004) from the World Medical Association provides the cornerstone for ethics in biomedical research. This document has become the focal point for debate regarding the ethical acceptability of the conditions for medical research. Helsinki has played a determining role in the development of international and national guidelines and regulations in research. In the area of paediatric research, Helsinki has posed new questions and challenges, and it has both reflected and pushed the development of US, European, and international considerations regarding the development of health interventions for children. Within Europe, and CESP in particular, the Declaration of Helsinki has played a pivotal role in reflections on, and the promotion of, ethical research in children. The presentation will show the impact of the Declaration of Helsinki and the international discussion on ethics in biomedical research on paediatric research in Europe.Cross Agency Working and Information SharingT BerneyPrudhoe Hospital, Prudhoe, Northumberland, UKMedical confidentiality, a contract that is at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship, is complicated by the inclusion of other parties: A. On the child’s part, this is an inevitable element for, as a minor, his/her interests are represented by the parent. As the child moves through adolescence, their right to privacy requires the exclusion of the parent from the confidential relationship, a process that is complicated by anything that impairs the child’s autonomy (notably intellectual disability). Events such as abuse by the parents or parental psychiatric disturbance, mean that their can be so great a divergence between parental interests and the child’s. If the child does not have the competence to be a full partner in the confidential relationship, the doctor may find that this is then with a proxy outside the family. B. On the doctor’s part, good medical care increasingly requires a team approach by an ill-defined and variable group that is multidisciplinary and multiagency. The boundaries of these teams often are so diffuse and extensive as to be incomprehensible to a child and family. They extend to include not just the people the patient actually sees treating them but also laboratory and pharmacy staff and, linked I a more indirect fashion,. people such as the student and the administrator. The team may include people employed by other agencies — notably teacher and social worker — the discipline not necessarily being a guide to the employer. The difficulty is not only that different agencies have different concepts and thresholds of confidentiality but also that they have different reasons for their involvement; they have their own agendas. A concrete indicator of confidentiality is the circulation list for clinical letters for it indicates the boundary of confidentiality for that particular matter. Especially where it includes the patient (a practice recently introduced in England) for the practice defines the extent to which the patient has the authority to control the distribution of personal information. The letter also defines their status in relation to their parents — are they addressed to the patient or to the parents — as well as that of other professionals involved in their care. Certain issues regularly present the paediatrician with their own difficulties such as the pregnant minor who does not want their family to know, and the family in conflict (short of clear-cut child abuse) who do not want other agencies to be brought in. Child abuse brings its own particular problems where the paediatrician can find disclosure that is in his patient’s best interests (to prevent further injury to the child) shifting to disclosure that is in the public interest (to prevent injury to other children). Although the determinant of the degree of disclosure is governed by the ‘need to know,’ partial disclosure is not simple and, once the process has started, it can be very unclear as to who has what responsibility for continued confidentiality.Privacy and Confidentiality in Children’s HealthcareP ThorntonPear Tree Surgery, Kingsbury, Warwickshire, UKIt would be difficult to name a democracy in the Western World that pays less respect to confidential medical information than the United Kingdom.” It would be easy to dismiss such criticism if it hadn’t come from such an authoritive source. Dr John Havard was speaking in 1989. He was then the secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), a barrister as well as being qualified in medicine. In 2006, day in day out large numbers of patients divulge highly sensitive information to doctors and the information does not seem to leak out into the public domain. From the perspective of the doctor in clinical practice it is easy to assume that is no great problem with medical confidentiality. So was Havard wrong? Do patients with hold important information from clinicians? What has happened to standards, custom and practice in the interim? Does current practice meet the requirements of the Data Protection and Human Rights Acts? How will the migration to electronic records improve or diminish privacy for patients? At its Annual Representative Meeting in June, the BMA changed its policy. They now demand that patients should give explicit consent before information is transferred on to the national database — an “opt-in”. Connecting for Health are recommending that information be transferred to the national spine having simply informed patients by leaflet of the database proposals. They regard it as sufficient to give patients the facility to “opt-out”. But the “opt out” they are offering is simply the use of software safeguards to block the sharing of information via the database. It remains their intention that “People should not be offered the choice to opt out of recording their healthcare data on National Care Records service.” And this is against a the background of connecting for health documents which confirm that the software safeguards on offer — metaphorically dubbed “sealed envelopes” — are not yet written and tested, will not be available in time for the initial proposed uploads of summary information from GP systems, will never work in respect of scanned images of correspondence and can be over ridden, contrary to the wishes of the patient. Conflated with all of this we have the proposed national Identity register and the two children’s registers by which information about children and their parents will be required to be shared.Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: Impact of Prevenar in North AmericaJ D KellnerAlberta, CanadaThe 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, Prevenar) was licensed and recommended for routine use in all infants and high-risk children in the USA in 2000 and in Canada in 2001. Prevenar has been very effective in both countries. Data from post-licensure studies will be presented that show Prevenar has been highly effective to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease in vaccine recipients. Data will also be presented to show the large indirect effect (herd immunity) in unimmunized children and adults. Overall, more than 2 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease are prevented indirectly for every case prevented directly. Another benefit of Prevenar has been a reduction in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant pneumococcal infections. The impact of replacement disease with nonvaccine serotypes has been small.Rotavirus Infections-The Virus and Its Disease, What are We Talking about?K JohansenDepartment of Virology, Immunology and Vaccinology Swedish Institute for Infectious Disease Control, SwedenRotavirus infections are the leading cause of severe dehydrating gastroenteritis, responsible for ∼600,000 deaths per year worldwide in children less than 5 years of age. Almost all children in developed and developing countries acquire their first episode of rotavirus-induced infection before their fifth birthday. Although &gt;80% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur in children in developing countries significant morbidity and occasional deaths occur in developed countries. Examination of rotavirus-induced annual hospitalisation incidence from several industrialized countries demonstrated a median rate of 445 per 100 000 children. The spectrum of symptoms that rotaviruses induce ranges from mild, watery diarrhoea of limited duration to fever, profuse diarrhoea and frequent vomiting that may result in severe dehydration leading to electrolyte imbalance and possibly death. It is difficult to predict which child will develop severe disease and complications to rotavirus-induced infections in industrialized countries are poorly quantified. Rotavirus is a well-known cause of community-acquired diarrhoea but it is less well recognized as a major cause of nosocomial infection in children although it is found consistently to be one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired diarrhoea. Two proteins of the outer capsid (VP4 and VP7) induce neutralizing antibodies and are used for genotyping, G-typing (the glycoprotein VP7) and Ptyping (the protease cleaving protein VP4). Due to the segmented nature of the rotavirus genome (consisting of 11 segments of dsRNA) rotaviruses can reassort during infection with multiple virus strains. Rotaviruses have been detected in many species of wild and domestic animals. Theoretically ∼110 reassortments are possible but it has been shown repeatedly in studies from different parts of the world that G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9 contribute to &gt;95% of all rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. It will be difficult to eradicate rotaviruses this is why a reasonable goal for rotavirus vaccination is to eliminate severe disease and hospitalization and decrease the total number of rotavirus-induced infections.Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis: Time for Vaccination!F Gimenez-SanchezAdvisory Committee of Vaccines, Spanish Association of Pediatrics, Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Torrecardenas Hospital, Almeria, SpainThe availability of rotavirus vaccination to reduce Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis (PRG) burden in Europe has stimulated efforts to characterize the real burden of rotavirus. It is estimated that PRG results in relatively few deaths per year in Europe, however, nearly every child in Europe is infected with rotavirus by age 5 years and the majority will have gastroenteritis, resulting in about 2.8 million cases cared at home, 700,000 outpatient visits and 87,000 hospitalisations. A prospective, observational study (REVEAL) conducted in seven study areas (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK) between October 2004 to September 2005 confirmed the high burden of rotavirus infections in Europe: 95% of PRG cases were in children above 6 months of age with more than 50% of hospitalisations and emergency department visits due to PRGE. The mean duration of hospitalisation varied between 2.5 to 5 days with at least one parent who had to miss work in 66% of families with a hospitalised child. In addition to causing morbidity and mortality in children, Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis creates a major economic burden on health care systems and families in Europe. Recent study (REVEAL) found that five globally common rotaviruses serotypes (G1,G2,G3,G4 &amp; G9) represent more than 98.5% of the circulating rotavirus strains in Europe. Almost two decades ago, studies demonstrated that rotaviruses serotypes (G1,G2,G3,G4) were predominant with an emerging novel rotavirus type: G9. To effectively reduce Paediatric Rotavirus Burden, a rotavirus vaccine should have demonstrated its efficacy against those five predominant rotavirus serotypes. Despite the significant morbidity and costs associated with Rotavirus in Europe, there is always a need to raise awareness of the rotavirus disease among European physicians and policy-makers in order to help the decision-making process about recommendation and use of rotavirus vaccination in each country. In industrialised countries, if widely used, rotavirus vaccination could substantially reduce the number and associated costs of child hospitalisations and clinical visits for acute diarrhoea as well as office visits and burden on the family.Rotateq®: Ensure Successful VaccinationP HeatonMerck Research Laboratories, USAThe pentavalent human-bovine (WC3) reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq® — Merck &amp; Co., Inc.) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency earlier this year, with registration and/or filing in multiple countries. The vaccine, which is provided in a ready-to-use liquid formulation, was demonstrated to be generally well tolerated and efficacious in Phase III studies conducted in 11 countries worldwide, preventing 98% of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis and reducing rotavirus-related hospitalizations and emergency visits by 95%. Reductions in rotavirus-related health care contacts were comparable across geographic regions and across different serotypes including G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8]-containing G9 strains. The vaccine did not show evidence of an increase in intussusception and was well tolerated with respect to other adverse experiences of special clinical interest for rotavirus vaccines, including fever, vomiting, and diarrhea. This presentation will provide an update of the clinical safety and efficacy data from the Phase III studies.Home Oxygen Delivery and TreatmentH F Ayyash1, H I Alfaneck2, A Herrick31Department of Paediatrics, Doncaster Royal Infirmary, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, United Kingdom, 2PCT Health Care, Chesterfield, North Derbyshire, United Kingdom, 3CNDRH, North Derbyshire, United KingdomBackground and AimsAs the structure and financing of health and pharmaceutical care changes, families provide increasingly complex home oxygen treatment for their chronically ill children who are oxygen dependent.MethodsWe describe the clinical care of a child who was born prematurely and developed severe respiratory distress syndrome requiring ventilation in special care baby unit.Neurotoxicity of Hyperoxia in Cortical Neuronal CultureM Toennessen, M Berns, B Gerstner, M ObladenDepartment of Neonatology, Charité Virchow Hospital, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsA growing body of evidence indicates that hyperoxia affects apoptotic processes especially in unmature neuronal cells of premature infants. In the developing rat brain and in cell culture hyperoxia has been identified to cause neurodegeneration. We therefore examined the effects of hyperoxia in cultured rat neuronal cells at different maturation stages.MethodsPrimary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from Wistar rat embryos at 18 days gestation and exposed to hyperoxia (80%) for 48 h at different maturation stages (division 7 for immature neuronal culture, and division 14 for mature neuronal culture). Control cells were kept in normoxia. Cell viability was assessed by the methyltetrazolium method (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH). Cells showed morphologic changes consistent with apoptosis. Involvement of caspases was shown by assessment of caspase-3-like-activity, and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was shown by CM-H2DCF-DA-assay.The Cannabinoid Agonist WIN 55,212-2 Reduces Brain Damage after Experimental Hypoxia-Ischemia in Newborn RatsJ Martínez-Orgado1, D Fernández-López3, R Pazos2, R Tolón2, M A Moro3, J Romero2, I Lizasoain31Area Pediatria-Neonatología, Fundación Hospital Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain, 2Laboratorio de Apoyo a la Investigación, Fundación Hospital Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain, 3Departamento de Farmacología, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsTo assess the neuroprotective effect of the cannabinoid WIN55212 after experimental hypoxia-ischemia (HI) in newborn rats.MethodsLeft common carotid artery was ligated and sectioned in anesthetized 7-day-old Wistar rats, which later inhaled 8% O2 for 120 minutes. Then, single doses of vehicle (0.5% DMSO; n=10), WIN55212 (0.1 mg/kg; n=13), WIN + the CB1 antagonist SR141716A (3mg/kg; n=6) or WIN + the CB2 antagonist SR144528 (2 mg/kg; n=6) were administered. Control group had sham surgery without hypoxia or treatment. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (T2WI, DWI, ADC maps) was performed at 24h, 72h and 7 days after HI (Biospec 47/40, 7 Tesla). Then, rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde and brains removed for Nissl staining and GFAP inmmunofluorescence.Neurotoxicity of Bilirubin and Ibuprofen in Cortical Neuronal CultureM Berns, M Toennessen, P Koehne, M ObladenDepartment of Neonatology, Charité, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsPreterm infants are on risk for bilirubin associated brain damage. In cell cultures bilirubin causes neuronal apoptosis and necrosis. Ibuprofen is used for closing the ductus arteriosus which usually occurs at an age when hyperbilirubinemia is on its maximum. Ibuprofen interferes with bilirubin-albumin-binding. We therefore examined the effects of bilirubin in combination with ibuprofen in rat neuronal cultures.MethodsPrimary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from Wistar rat embryos at 18 days gestation and exposed to ibuprofen (7.5–1000 µg/ml) alone or in combination with bilirubin (1–10 µM) for 48 h. Control cells were kept in normoxia. Cell viability was assessed by the methyltetrazolium method (MTT) and lactate dehydrogenase release (LDH). DNA-fragments as marker of apoptosis was measured by elisa.Resveratrol, a Red Wine Constituent, Offers Neuroprotection Following Neonatal Hypoxia-Ischemia in RatsF Karalis1, E Spandou1, C Simeonidou1, I Papadopoulou1, V Soubasi2, O Guiba-Tziampiri11Dept of Physiology, 2Dept of Neonatology, Faculty of Medicine, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, GreeceBackground and AimsPrevious studies have shown that resveratrol, a polyphenolic compound found in grapes and wine, has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in experimental models of ischemia-reperfusion injuries. Aim of this study was to investigate whether resveratrol: a) has neuroprotective effect on hypoxia-ischemia (HI) induced brain damage in neonatal rats and b) exerts its action through inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).MethodsAt postnatal day 7 rats were separated into 3 groups: A (control) sham operated, B (HI) ligated and exposed to hypoxia for 1h and C (R-HI) post-treated with resveratrol (90mg/kg in 2 equal doses). At P10, based on the gross morphologic appearance of the infarction, brains were grouped in 4 categories (normal, mild, moderate and severe). Histological analysis was performed at the level of dorsal hippocampus according to a semiquantitative 5-point scale. iNOS expression was estimated using immunohistochemistry.Preservation of the Blood-Brain-Barrier by Magnesium Sulfate Treatment after Perinatal Asphyxia in Fetal LambsF Goñi de Cerio1, A Alvarez1, F J Alvarez2, N Martínez1, A Caballero3, M C Rey-Santano2, V E Mielgo2, A Valls I Soler2,4, E Hilario11Dept of Cell Biology and Histology, School of Medicine, University of Basque Country, 2Research Unit on Pediatrics, Cruces Hospital, Basque Country 3Dept of Neuroscience, 4Dept of Pediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Basque Country, SpainBackground and AimsThe astroglial protein S100 is a marker of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) leakage and an early indicator of brain damage. To evaluate the neuroprotective efficacy of MgSO4 treatment in a hypoxic-ischemic event (HI) using protein S100 as brain damaged tissue-marker in preterm lambs.Methods20 fetal lambs (133 days) were randomly assigned to: One control group (sacrificed 3 hour after delivery) and three hypoxic-ischemic groups (one immediately sacrificed and two others receiving or not 400 mg/kg of MgSO4 during 20 minutes and sacrificed 3 hours after HI event). Injury was induced by partial occlusion of umbilical cord during 60 minutes. Brains were fixed, divided in different regions, disgregated and immunolabelled for protein S100. Samples were analyzed by flow citometry and positive cells were evaluated. One-factor ANOVA was performed (p&lt;0.05).Cerebral Injury in a Full-Term Newborn with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE): What’s the Best Instrumental Tool?S Soffritti1, G Ancora1, F Sandri1, L Marvulli1, L Nardi2, N Bisacchi2, B Mostacci3, R Lodi3, B Barbiroli3, G Faldella11Institute of Neonatology, Department of Gynecological, Obstetrical and Pediatric Sciences, Bologna, Italy, 2Psicology, Department of Gynecological, Obstetrical and Pediatric Sciences, Bologna, Italy, 3Department of Clinical Medicine and Applied Biotechnology, Bologna, ItalyBackground and AimsDefining outcome in HIE is important, especially in Sarnat grade II, for counselling parents and early therapeutic intervention.MethodsCase report: Female, outborn, GA 41 weeks, spontaneous delivery, AS 2-3-5, umbilical artery pH 7.1, BE −16 mmol/L, meconium stained amniotic fluid, intubated and ventilated at birth. Referred to our NICU at 2 hrs of life for asphyxia and meconium inhalation. Sarnat 2 HIE was diagnosed on admission. At 12 hrs of life, clinical seizures appeared, amplitude-EEG showed a discontinuous normal voltage pattern that recovered to normal (CNV) at 20 hrs with epileptic activity until 25 hrs. At 4 days, after crises of apnoea and bradycardia, a-EEG showed a CNV pattern with recurrent seizures. Traditional EEG showed left temporal regions spikes. At 6 days 1H-MRS detected a reduction of NAA/Cr and an increase of lactate and lipids in the left frontal-parietal white matter; a reduction of ADC was observed in the same areas. First day cranial ultrasound showed parasagittal hyperechogenicity no longer visible after 2 wks. 1H-MRS and DWI at 6 months were normal.Effects of Erythropoietin on Cerebral Blood Circulation Measured by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy in Preterm NeonatesM Wolf1, K Egli1, T Karen2, R Barbaro1, A S Bauschatz1, H U Bucher11Clinic of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, 2Department of Neonatology University Childrens Hospital Tuebingen, GermanyBackground and AimsIn a randomized controlled trial erythropoietin (epo) was given to preterm infants to study potential neuroprotective effects. Within this framework the aim was to assess, whether the relatively high dose of epo affects the cerebral blood circulation.MethodsSixteen newborn infants with 28.8±2.2 weeks gestational age and 1167±382g birthweight were enrolled and received either 3000U/kg epo (epo-group, N=10) or placebo (placebo-group, N=6) i.v. A near infrared spectroscopy sensor (Hamamatsu™ NIRO-300) was placed on the head of each infant. The differences between the baseline before the injection and the first (period A) and second 10min (period B) and the following 30 min (period C) after injection were calculated for tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and hemoglobin index (THI) and compared between the two groups.Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), Cerebral Blood Flow and Hemodynamic Changes in Hypoxic PigletsB Loureiro1, M C Rey-Santano2, V E Mielgo2, E Gastiasoro2, A Valls-I-Soler1, F J Alvarez21Department of Pediatrics, Cruces Hospital, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, Spain, 2Research Unit, Cruces Hospital, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, SpainBackground and AimsNIRS is a successful technique to measure cerebral oxygenation, but its use is limited to cortical zones. So, the combination with experimental procedures, like transient time flow or microspheres injection, is a better approach to determine regional or total cerebral perfusion. To compare cortical oxygenation measured by NIRS and transient time flow of hypoxic piglets induced by 8% FiO2.Methods6 piglets with 5–9 postnatal days were used (86/609 EC). Animals were tracheostomised and IPPV was established. Lung mechanics (VT, Raw, CL, din) were determined. Femoral artery catheter was placed to obtain blood samples, to measure cardiac output (CO), heart rate (HR) and mean arterial pressure (MAP). A transient time flow probe was placed around carotid artery to measure cerebral blood flow (CF). Cerebral oxygenation was determined by NIRS. Hypoxia was induced by reduction of FiO2 at 8% during 20 min. Data represented by mean ± SD. One-factor ANOVA was performed (p&lt;0.05).Performance of a Seizure Detection Algorithm for Neonates on Two-channel EEG DatasetM A Navakatikyan1, C G Spooner2, C Menache Starobinski3, J M Zempel4, T E Inder51Department of Research, BrainZ Instruments Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand, 2Department of Neurology, Starship Children’s Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand 3Department of Pediatric Neurology, Children’s Hospital, Geneva, Switzerland, 4Pediatric Epilepsy Center, St Louis Children’s Hospital, St. Louis, MO, USA, 5Department of Pediatrics, St Louis Children’s Hospital, St. Louis, MO, USABackground and AimsAn on-line neonatal seizure detection algorithm (Navakatikyan et al) based on wave-sequence analysis previously compared favourably against the Gotman et al (1997) algorithm (Sensa software 5.4) on a dataset of conventional multi-channel EEG. However, devices with a limited number of channels are important for long-term monitoring and ICU. Aim of the study was to evaluate the Navakatikyan algorithm on a two-channel EEG dataset.MethodsThe Navakatikyan algorithm was assessed on 56 one-hour two-channel EEG files (BRM2 Brain Monitor, BrainZ Instruments Ltd, New Zealand). The records were independently marked for seizures by four pediatric neurologists. Performance of the Navakatikyan algorithm was compared to the performance of the Gotman algorithm against each of the four specialists. Performance of the specialists was also compared against each other. Conservative and liberal assessments of algorithm performance were used, based on detected seizure duration.Cerebral Function Monitoring with Amplitude Integrated EEG in Neonatal ECMOD Blanco Bravo, P Chimenti Camacho, S Zeballos Sarrato, B Bernardo Atienza, S Villar, I Marsinyach, B Arias Novas, S Caballero, M Sanchez Luna, V Perez-SheriffDepartment of Pediatrics, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañon, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsDuring the last few years it is possible to use continuous EEG to monitor brain function. ECMO represent a high risk procedure where monitoring cerebral function could be critical to help clinical decisions. Compare Cerebral Function Monitoring (CFM) with classical two channel EEG and biespectral index (BIS) in newborns during ECMO support.MethodsProspective observational study with CMF using the Olympic CMF 6000 and continuous EEG with CSA and BIS. The quality and characteristic of the traces and diagnostic support were analyzed.The Effect of Inhibition of Neuronal Synthetase of Nitric Oxide on Neuronal Apoptosis, in an Experimental Model of Seizures, During DevelopmentI Papadopoulou1, E Spandou1, C Simeonidou1, F Karalis1, I Liangouris1, N Grigoriadis3, G Karkavelas2, O Guiba-Tziambiri11Department of Physiology, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, 2Department of Pathology, Medical School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece, 3Laboratory of Experimental Neurology and Neuroimmunology, Department of Neurology B, AHEPA Hospital, Thessaloniki, GreeceBackground and AimsNitric oxide is involved in the pathophysiology of seizures in a multifunctional way. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of nNOS inhibition on seizures-induced neurodegeneration, by examining the expression of BAX, an apoptosis marker.MethodsWistar rats (10–11-d-old) were divided into 4 groups: A, B, C and D (control). Groups A, B and C were subjected to hypoxic conditions. At P21–P22, rats of groups B and C were administered with kainic acid (KA 10mg/kg i.p) and group C was pre-treated with 7NI (50mg/kg i.p). The BAX and nNOS expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in the rat hippocampus at 4,24,48 and 72 hours after KA administration and prolonged seizures.Il1Beta Promoter Polymorphisms — Association with Cerebral PalsyH Kapitanovic Vidak1, S Kapitanovic21Special Hospital for Children with Neurodevelopmental and Motor Difficulties, Zagreb, Croatia, 2Division of Molecular Medicine, Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, CroatiaBackground and AimsCerebral palsy (CP) is a nonprogressive motor disorder caused by white matter damage in the developing brain. It is often accompanied with neurocognitive and sensory disabilities. The cause and pathogenesis of CP is multifactorial and continues to be poorly understood. Chorioamnionitis, clinically silent or manifest, has been reported to be a risk factor for CP both in term and preterm infants. IL1beta gene was mapped to chromosome 2q14 and a few polymorphisms associated with altered IL1beta production have been described. Increased IL1beta levels have been found in peripheral blood in septic neonates and can be associated with the development of cerebral palsy. The aim of our study was to estimate allelic frequency for two promoter SNPs in IL1beta gene, -31 and -511 in the children with CP.MethodsDNAs obtained from peripheral blood of 27 CP patients and 162 unrelated healthy volunteers were genotyped for the IL1beta -31 and -511 SNP using real-time PCR TaqMan® SNP genotyping assays.Cranial Ultrasonography (US) and Prediction of Outcome in Term Newborns with Hypoxic Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)G Ancora1, S Soffritti1, F Sandri1, E Mazzoni1, N Bisacchi2, L Nardi2, B Benassi1, G Faldella11Institute of Neonatology, Department of Gynecological, Obstetrical and Pediatric Sciences, Bologna, Italy, 2Psicology, Department of Gynecological, Obstetrical and Pediatric Sciences, Bologna, ItalyBackground and AimsStudies about prognostic value of cerebral US have consisted of small numbers of patients and have showed contrasting results. US is a safe and greatly used bedside examination and it is useful to continue to report data about its prognostic value.Methods26 newborns affected by HIE (Sarnat grading) were studied by US in the first 72 hrs of life. Pathological US were defined having diffuse hyperecogenicity and slit ventricles, isolated parasagittal hyperecogenicity, talamic and basal ganglia hyperecogenicity. At 12-18 months of life a motor evaluation and a psychomotor assessment (Griffith test) were performed by an expert psychiatrist and psychologist. Visual and hearing function were evaluated during the first year of life. Motor outcome was classified as normal, transient hypertonia and cerebral palsy.In Vivo Quantification of Sod Activation in Newborn MiceH H Odland1, G Dohlen1, E Thaulow2, O D Saugstad11Department of Pediatric Research, National Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 2Department of Pediatric Cardiology, National Hospital, Oslo, NorwayBackground and AimsSuperoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) plays an important role in oxygen radical brain homeostasis. Neonatal transgenic mice overexpressing SOD-1 are more susceptible to hypoxic injury than adult transgenic mice. The activity of SOD-1 is higher in full term infants than in preterm infants. SOD-1 activity in newborn transgenic mice was assessed for 10 days.Methods6 heterozygote litters with a total of 33 light producing transgenic reporter mice (CD-1-Tg(Sod1-luc)Xen), containing a 15.5kb mouse superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD-1) gene promoter, were imaged using the Xenogen imaging system. This includes a CCD camera to detect luminescence in luciferin injected mice. SOD-1 Activity (luminescence expressed as photons) was observed primarily in the brain, liver and skin.Effect of Changes in end Expiratory Pressure on Brain and Upper Body Flow in Ventilated NewbornsK A de Waal1, N Evans1, D A Osborn1, M Kluckow21Department of Neonatal Medicine, Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, 2Department of Neonatology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Sydney, NSW, AustraliaBackground and AimsApplying positive pressure ventilation to premature infants may diminish cerebral blood flow and cardiac output. Low brain and upper body flow (superior vena cava flow, SVC) is a risk factor for cerebral ischaemia and intraventricular haemorrhage in preterm infants, with previous research showing mean airway pressure as a significant determinant of SVC flow. It is not known whether this is a direct effect of positive pressure ventilation or a reflection of severity of lung disease. We investigated the effect of increasing PEEP on systemic blood flow at different gestations and with increasing postnatal age.MethodsVentilated newborns were measured before and 10 minutes after increasing PEEP from 5 to 8 cmH2O. Simultaneous echocardiographic and respiratory function measurements were collected between 3 and 9 hours of age, then daily if still ventilated.Apo B Gene Polymorphisms in Czech Patients with Atherosclerosis and Childhood ObesityI J Mazura1,2, H Svobodova2, P Sedlak1,2, P Blaha2, J Zvarova11Institute of Computer Science AS CR, Prague, Czech Republic, 2Department of Anthropology and Human Genetics, The Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czech RepublicBackground and AimsAtherosclerosis and childhood obesity are the most frequent disorders in Czech population. Influence of the genetic factors on atherosclerosis and obesity is known. We analyzed relationship between anthropometric, biochemical values and genetic polymorphisms in apolipoprotein B gene.MethodsWe collected and tested from January 1999 to December 2004, 51 patients with artherosclerosis and 99 patients with childhood obesity. In both groups we analyzed by basic molecular genetic techniques (blood sample DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction, restriction fragment length polymorphisms method and electrophoresis) two promotor Apo B gene polymorphisms.Oxygen Saturation in Neonates. Comparison of Three Different Pulse Oximeters with Arterial MeasurementsM M Indrebø1, K Liestol2, L I Brundvand1, R Lindemann11Department of Paediatrics, Ulleval University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 2Institute of Informatics, University of Oslo, NorwayBackground and AimsThere are several brands of pulse oximeters, but accuracy and reliability differ and there is lack of validation in neonates. We wanted to compare the accuracy of three pulse oximeters compared with arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), and time consumption to a stable value.MethodsThe measurements were performed on neonates who needed an arterial line. SaO2 was measured from blood sample taken from an umbilical artery catheter and analysed with a RadiometerABL735. The pulse oximeters used were NellcorOxiMaxN-550. MasimoSETRadical™. MiniCorrOximeterBCI3402. 42 measurements were performed on 21 patients, GA 23.4–41.3 weeks, age 1–25 days. On each infant, two different random monitors were used, on two different feet. The time until a stable SpO2 was registered, and a SaO2 was measured.Cardiac Tumors in ChildhoodB Varan1, K Tokel1, I I Cetin1, U A Orun1, S Mercan2, S Aslamaci21Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Baskent University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, Turkey2Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Baskent University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, TurkeyBackground and AimsCardiac tumors are rare in infants and children but are a serious cause of morbidity and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics of our patients with cardiac tumor.Methods13 patients with cardiac tumor diagnosed between 1994 and 2005 were evaluated retrospectively. There was a clear male predominance, M : F = 12:1. Three patients also had congenital heart disease (1 ASD, 1 VSD, and 1 VSD and pulmonary stenosis).False Tendons as a Anatomic Substrate for Idiopathic Ventricular TachycardiaM I Kelmendi, R H BejiqiDepartment of Cardiology, University Children’s Hospital, Prishtina, Serbia and MontenegroBackground and AimsLeft ventricular false tendons (FT) are fibrous or fibromuscular bands that stretch across the left ventricle from the septum to the free wall. They are the most frequent cause of innocent murmur in childhood and can be seen in up to 50% of children examined with 2D echo. Numerous reports indicate the incidence of the coexistence of left ventricular false tendons and premature ventricular contractions. The aim of this study is to determine the incidence of false tendons in children with heart murmur and to stress the link between false tendons and idiopathic ventricular tachicardia in some of those cases.Methods2015 children with heart murmur are examined at University Children’s Hospital Echo lab, using Doppler echo with it’s modalities.Quality of Life in Children with Heart ArrhythmiasG V Dubova, N V Nagorna, Y V BordyugovaDepartment of Post-Diploma Education, Donetsk State Medical University, Donetsk, UkraineBackground and AimsThe heart arrhythmias (HA) make influence not only a physical condition of the child, but also on psychology of his behaviour, emotional reactions, his place in a social life that is why the effective help to this patients is impossible without the evaluation of quality of life (Qol). To study the Qol in children with HA.Methods97 children (53 girls and 44 boys) at the age 6–18 years old with different HA were examined. All children completed the own special questionnaire ‘Assessment of the quality of life in children with heart arrhythmias’ (UA, Pat. 12262, A61B10/02, №200509883).Cholesterol Screening in an at Risk Paediatric PopulationM J O’Grady1, A M Brown2, M B O’Neill11Department of Paediatrics, Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar, Ireland, 2Department of Cardiac Rehabilitation, Mayo General Hospital, Castlebar, IrelandBackground and AimsElevation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a recognised risk factor for premature atherosclerosis and such elevations have their antecedents in the paediatric population. This study evaluated the frequency of elevated LDL cholesterol in children and adolescents in whom one parent had a history of premature ischaemic heart disease.MethodsThe Cardiac Rehabilitation database at Mayo General Hospital was searched between 2001 – 2005 to determine individuals with a history of premature (&lt; 55 years) ischaemic heart disease (IHD). Parents were subsequently surveyed to determine the number of children. Inclusion criteria were children and adolescents 8 – 18 years having one parent with premature IHD. Patients had a fasting lipid profile and results were classified as acceptable, borderline/high or high in accordance with American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines. Those with high levels were screened for secondary causes of hyperlipidaemia. Normative data inclusive of height and weight were obtained and parental risk factor profiles were ascertained.The Intracellular Pathogens Infections in Children with Heart ArrhythmiasO V Pshenychna1, N V Nagorna1, Y I Yulysh21Chair of Pediatrics, Department of Post-Diploma Education, Donetsk State Medical University, Donetsk, Ukraine, 2Chair of Propedevtic Pediatrics, Donetsk State Medical University, Donetsk, UkraineBackground and AimsProblem of heart arrhythmias during the last decennial event is one of the most actual in children’s cardiology. In last years appears all more given in favour of participations of intracellular infectious agents in genesis and rates of progressing number of cardiovascular diseases. Purpose: To study the presence of row the intracellular pathogens infections beside the children with heart arrhythmias.Methods52 children (20 boys and 32 girls) at the age from 6 month to 16 years with different heart arrhythmias were examined. All children the serological diagnostics of specific antibody of class IgG to row of infectious agents (herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, chlamydia pneumoniae) was conducted; the DNA of this infectious agents defined a method of polymerase chain reactions.Ventricular Arrhythmias — Diagnosis and TreatmentK Kuzevska-Maneva, R Kacarska, B Gjurkova, S Krstevska, V MicevskaDepartment of Cardiology, University Children’s Hospital, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsVentricular arrhythmias (VA) in children are less common than supraventricular and they are occurring more frequently after repairing of congenital heart disease, especially of complex CHD.

The majority of patients have conotruncal anomalies within DiGeorge syndrome, velocardiofacial syndrome and conotruncal anomaly face syndrome. Microdeletion of chromosomal region 22q11 is recognised by fluorescence in situ hybridization technique. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency of the 22q11 deletion in children with conotruncal cardiac defects.MethodsThere were evaluated fifty children diagnosed with conotruncal anomalies who were admitted to the Department of Cardiology in the Third Pediatric Clinic, Cluj-Napoca. Nine of them presented additional extracardiac clinical features. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was performed to detect 22q11 deletion.Pulmonary Hypertension in a Patient with 11Q Deletion DisorderL J A Corel1, Y van Bever2, M Witsenburg3, D Tibboel11Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 3Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children’s Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThe 11q deletion disorder (Jacobsen syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder with variable phenotype (Grossfeld, P.D. et al. Am J Med Genet A. 2004 Aug 15;129(1):51–61). Cardiac anomalies has been described: mainly ventricular septal defect (VSD) or left sided obstructive lesions. So far pulmonary hypertension (PHT) has never been reported in patients with Jacobsen syndrome.MethodsObservational study (case report).The Morphological Structure of Heart in Children with Congenital Heart-Diseases in Combination with a Intracellular InfectionN V Nagorna, K V VinogradovDepartment of Post-Diploma Education, Donetsk State Medical University, Donetsk, UkraineBackground and AimsTo study the morphological structure of heart of children with congenital heart-diseases (CHD), associated with a intracellular infection.Methods15 children (8 girls, 7 boys) from 5 month to 14 years with the different types of CHD (atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, coarctation of the aorta, patent ductus arteriosus, diseases of Fallot) were inspected. Specific IgG to herpes simplex virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, chlamydia pneumoniae, toxoplasma gondii were determined by the method of enzyme immunoassay. A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to those exciters in the serum and intraoperative bioptates of the tissues of heart was conducted. The morphological study of intraoperative bioptates of the tissues of heart was conducted by a light microscopy.A Review of the Use of Prophylactic Indomethacin and a Comparison with Other StrategiesS Harigopal1, D Anand2, M Kubwalo1, M Tan2, J Turley1, K Poole1, N Subhedar11Neonatal Unit, Liverpool Women’s Hospital, UK, 2University of Liverpool, UKBackground and AimsProphylactic indomethacin (pIND) is effective in reducing symptomatic PDA (sPDA) requiring medical or surgical closure. Our aim was (1) to determine whether the short term effects of pIND were replicable in our population and (2) to compare the likely effectiveness of 3 different strategies for preventing or treating sPDA.MethodsWe reviewed case notes of babies with a birth weight of &lt;1250g treated with pIND. Information was collected on the incidence of sPDA requiring a further course of indomethacin and/or ductal ligation and these rates were compared with previously reported rates of sPDA. Three strategies of preventing or treating sPDA in babies &lt; 1250g were modelled using these data: (1) prophylaxis; (2) symptomatic treatment and (3) ‘selective’ prophylaxis of extremely preterm babies.Left Ventricular Myxoma: An Unusual Localization Caused Cardiac ArrestS V Yildirim1, R Turkoz2, B E Guc3, O Gulcan2, K Tokel11Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Baskent University, Adana Teaching and Medical Research Center, Adana, Turkey, 2Department of Cardiovascular Surgery, Baskent University, Adana Teaching and Medical Research Center, Adana, Turkey, 3Department of Pediatrics, Baskent University, Adana Teaching and Medical Research Center, Adana, TurkeyBackground and AimsPrimary cardiac tumors are rare, and myxomas constitute about 50% of primary cardiac tumors in patients of all ages. Myxomas are mostly localized in the left atrium (75%), and generally friable, pedinculated, gelatinous benign tumors often presents with cardiac obstruction and emboli. Here, we report a case of myxoma localized in left ventricular free wall caused syncope and cardiac arrest in a child.MethodsAn 11 years-old girl admitted to our hospital cause of syncope, cardiac arrest, and following consciousnesses. We learned that she was previously healthy; after the beden eğitimi lesson she had chest pain and in the hospital she suddenly felt down with cardiac arrest. After the cardiopulmonary resuscitation she transported to our hospital while she was intubated. We evaluated the patient, and echocardiography showed an intracardiac pedinculated tumor localized in the left ventricle free wall below the papillary muscle. The tumor was totally resected by transmitral approach; it was pathologically a simple myxoma. The child was discharged after 5 days surgery without complication.The Role of Echocardiography on Evaluation of the Severity of Mitral RegurgitationM I Kelmendi, R H BejiqiDepartment of Cardiology, University Children’s Hospital, Prishtina, KosovaBackground and AimsEchocardiography with Doppler has recently emerged as the method of choice for the non-invasive detection and evaluation of the severity and etiology of valvular regurgitation. There are many, qualitative and quantitative echocardiographic parameters that can provide assessment of valvular regurgitation.MethodsA retrospective study of children with rheumatic mitral regurgitation, examined at University Children’s Hospital, Prishtina. Following recommendations of the American Society of Echocardiography, six qualitative and quantitative parameters are used for assessing mitral valve regurgitation: regurgitant jet area, vena contracta, PISA, pulmonary artery pressure, pulmonary venous flow pattern and left atrium size.Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Very Low Birthweight InfantsM Vera1, A Riverola1, J Moreno1, F Prada2, J Bartrons2, X Mayol3, X Krauel11Neonatal Unit, Agrupació Sanitaria Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain, 2Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Agrupació Sanitaria Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain 3Department of Paediatric Cardiac Surgery, Agrupació Sanitaria Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, SpainBackground and AimsPatent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is a frequent complication in the clinical course of Very Low Birthweight Infants (VLBW). Our aim was to evaluate PDA in preterm infants in our Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.MethodsRetrospective review from data base of inborn preterm infants (&lt;33 weeks) admitted from 01/01/95 to 31/12/05. Diagnosis of PDA: 1) Birth weight (BW) &gt; 1000 gr., with clinical signs, confirmed by echocardiography, 2) BW &lt; 1000 gr., all had echocardiography for diagnosis in the first 48–72 hours of life.

More recently studies have emphasised the search for barriers to adequate nutrition. The objectives are to assess the nutritional status upon admission to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), to evaluate the prescribed and received calories during PICU stay and to identify factors confounding the actual intake.MethodsDuring the 4-month-study-period patients with an expected PICU stay of ≥ 72 hours were prospectively included. On admission anthropometric measurements were performed. Daily calories prescribed and actually delivered were recorded and compared to estimated energy requirements (EER). The reasons for decreasing the nutritional support were registered in parallel.Daily Oral Supplementation With L. Paracasei Cncm I-2116 Leads to A Down — Modulation of Milk Protein Hypersensitivity in MiceS Pecquet, S Chibani-Chennoufi, F Rochat, A MercenierDepartment of Nutrition and Health, Nestlé Research Center, Lausanne, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsCow’s milk allergy is one of the leading causes of food allergy in children. Sensitisation to milk proteins occurs early in life, leading to atopic symptoms. Some clinical studies showed that probiotic treatment of “at risk” infants might prevent them from allergic symptoms, in particular from atopic dermatitis. Here, we use a milk hypersensitivity mouse model to evaluate beneficial effect of the probiotic L. paracasei CNCM I-2116 on the onset of atopic symptoms.MethodsC3H/HeJ mice were sensitised 4 times with whey proteins associated with cholera toxin, once a week. All trial long, mice were receiving either L. paracasei CNCM I-2116 (5.108cfu/mL) or maltodextrine (matrix control) in drinking water. One week after last sensitisation, mice were orally challenged with b-lactoglobulin and symptoms (scratching, puffiness and activity loss) were followed for 45 min. At sacrifice, blood and faeces were collected for seric IgE, IgG1, MMCP1, histamine and faecal IgA. Faecal probiotic were recurrently counted during trial.Preterm Infants: Body Composition Assessment During the First Three Months of Corrected AgeP Roggero, P Piemontese, M L Giannì A Orsi, O Amato, V Puricelli, S Montella, F MoscaNICU, Clinica Mangiagalli (IRCCS), University of Milan, ItalyBackground and AimsBody composition (BC) assessment in premature infants is important for nutritional support as protein intake influences body fat retention. To examine postnatal changes in BC in preterm compared to full term infants.MethodsBC (%fat) was assessed using a new air displacement system (PEA POD, LMI Concord, CA) in 19 Caucasian PT (mean GA 31 wks ± 2,4; mean BW 1332 g ± 370) and in 52 Caucasian FT exclusively breast fed. In PT fat mass was evaluated at term adjusted age, 1,2 and 3 months of corrected age and in FT within 72 hours of life, at 1,2 and 3 months. The protein/100Kcal intake in PT up to term adjusted age: 3.1–2.7 g. Thereafter PT were fed standard formula.Markers of Insulin Resistance Syndrome in Obese Children and AdolescentsE Papadopoulou, E Giahnakis, M Avanidi, N M Fitrolaki, H Maniadaki, M KalmantiDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Crete, Heraklion, Crete, GreeceBackground and AimsThe prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MS) or insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) is high among obese children and adolescents, and increases with worsening obesity. All or some of the following characterizes the IRS: obesity, impaired glucose metabolism, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. The use of hematological and non-hematological markers to screen for IRS in this population remains a necessity.MethodsWe reviewed data from 76 obese children, including 33 females (43.4%) and 43 males (56.6%), with a mean age of 10.3 years (range 3–16), who were followed in our Childhood Obesity Clinic. BMI (kg/m2, waist circumference (WC, in cm), fasting glucose (fG, in mg/dL), fasting insulin (fI, in μU/mL), HOMA-IR index [Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance =fI×fG/22.5], systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), fasting triglycerides (fT, in mg/dL), and atheromatic index (AI=total cholesterol/HDL) were measured in every patient. Descriptive statistics and difference of means of variables (independent samples T test) were used. Correlations were considered as significant at the 0.01 or 0.05 levels (2-tailed).The Effect of Chronic Fetal Undernutrition and Hypoxemia on the Fetal Response to Acute HypoxiaT Mulder, E Villamor, Z Gura, C E Blanco,Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Maastricht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn most species fetal glucocorticoid activity increases late in gestation and is closely associated with maturational processes, essential for postnatal survival. However, fetal exposure to excess glucocorticoids is one mechanism suggested to contribute to adult cardiovascular disease. Objective: To describe the effect of chronic under nutrition and hypoxia on fetal glucocorticoid levels in an mother independent animal model.MethodsThree groups of fertilised eggs of White Leghorn chicken were incubated: 1) Chronic hypoxia group: incubation in a hypoxic (15% O2) environment 2) Malnutrition group: incubation after removal of 10% of the egg’s albumin in a normoxemic environment 3) Control group: incubation in a normoxemic environment without albumin removal. Plasma corticosterone was measured in blood samples from the chorio-allantoic artery. In each group 10 chick embryos were measured at day 10, 12, 14, 16 and 18 of incubation (complete incubation time 21 days).Oxidative Stress Markers in Reflex Tears of Children with Insulin Dependent Diabetes MellitusM I Eliopoulou1, N M Nikolakopoulou1, B E Spiliotis1, A M Exarchou2, C D Georgakopoulos2, F Lamari3, V S Gartaganis4, N K Karamanos41Pediatric Endocrine Unit, Department of Pediatrics, University of Patras, Greece, 2Department of Ophthalmology, University of Patras, Greece 3Department of Pharmacy, University of Patras, Greece, 4Laboratory of Biochemistry Department of Chemistry, University of Patras, GreeceBackground and AimsTo develop a novel method for the simultaneous determination of uric acid (a low-molecular weight antioxidant) and of malondialdehyde (MDA, indicator of lipid peroxidation) in reflex tears of healthy and children with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) by high performance capillary electrophoresis.MethodsTear samples were collected with pre-weighted strip filter papers, extracted with a low pH phosphate buffer containing EDTA and were stored at — 70°C in the presence of 2,6-di-tetrabutyl-4-methylphenol (BHT). Tears’ proteins were removed after centrifugation through centricon-3 membranes. Recovery values for all analytes were over 90%. Analyte separation is achieved in a 25 mM borate buffer, pH 10.0, containing 100 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) at the temperature of 25 oC and 20 kV (normal polarity). Reproducibility tests measuring both migration times and peak areas gave low relative standard deviation values. Calibration graphs were linear and the detection limits, defined as a signal to noise ratio of 3:1, were are 0.50, and 1.25 micromol for uric acid and MDA, respectively.Pulmonary Stretch Receptor Activity Related to the Energy Storage of Normal and Surfactant-Depleted Lungs During Spontaneous BreathingR Sindelar, G Sedin, A JonzonDepartment of Women’s and Children’s Health, University Children’s Hospital, Uppsala, SwedenBackground and AimsVagal input from slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs) is important for establishing regular breathing, normal surfactant function and normal pulmonary gas exchange at birth with the least work of breathing and without overextending the lung. Our aim was to study the response of PSRs to changes in energy storage of the lungs under conditions encountered in newborn infants.MethodsSingle units of PSRs were recorded in seven anaesthetised, spontaneously breathing young cats, before and after lung lavage and then after surfactant instillation. PSRs were classified as high threshold (HT) and low threshold (LT) receptors. Instantaneous impulse frequency (fimp) of PSRs was related to transpulmonary pressure (Ptp), tidal volume (VT), and inspiratory time. The PSR fimp was normalised (fN) to the energy storage of the lung during inspiration (sigmadeltaP*V).Prevention of Atopic Dermatitis in Mice by Oral Supplementation with Lactobacillus Rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724A Tanaka1, J Benyacoub2, S Pecquet2, S Blum2, A Mercenier2, H Matsuda11Laboratory of Veterinary Molecular Pathology and Therapeutics, Division of Animal Life Science, Institute of Symbiotic Science and Technology, Tokyo, Japan2 Department of Nutrition and Health, Nestle Research Center, Nestec Ltd., Lausanne, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsEpidemiological studies have pointed to a role of the intestinal microbiota in atopic diseases in infants. Increasing evidences suggest that intake of some probiotic bacteria reduces risk of atopic dermatitis (AD) in children. The NC/Nga mouse model of AD has an environmental etiology, which probably includes microbial stimuli. Thus representing an appropriate model for testing potential efficacy of dietary interventions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus CGMCC1.3724 on the development of AD in NC/Nga mice and document the potential underlying mechanism.MethodsPregnant NC/Nga mice received either sterile drinking water or water containing probiotics one week before delivery and this treatment was maintained until weaning. Weaning pups (n=10 per group) received water containing or not probiotics. Pups were transferred and kept into non-air controlled environment until 12 weeks of age. Clinical skin severity scores, scratching behavior, plasma concentrations of total IgE, and IFN-g and IL-10 mRNA expression levels in dorsal skin biopsies were examined in the two groups of pups.nonC Bakoula1, A Veltsista1, G Kavadias1, A Fretzayas2, A Prezerakou3, P Nicolaidou21First Department of Paediatrics, Aghia Sofia Children’s Hospital, 2Third Department of Paediatrics, Attikon University General Hospital, 3Second Department of Paediatrics, P. &amp; A. Kyriakou Children’s Hospital, University of Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsTo monitor the rates of exclusive breast feeding in Greek maternities and four weeks after discharge, and to determine whether or not supplementation in the hospital may alter to exclusive breastfeeding once discharged.MethodsWe questioned 4310 Greek mothers from seven representative hospitals on the fourth day in maternity and postpartum. Odds ratios were calculated to estimate the effects of health system, sociodemographic, psychosocial and environmental factors on the initiation of exclusive breast feeding and on the possible change from partial and formula feeding in the hospital to exclusive breast feeding at home, one month after discharge.Early Nutrition is Associated with Growth and Pulmonary Function at 1 Year in Premature Infants with Bronchopulmonary DysplasiaK Husseini1, S Isambert1, C Huon1, M Mokhtari1, M Chaussain2, C Dupont1,3, A Lapillonne1,31Department of Neonatology, Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital, Paris, France, 2Department of Respiratory Physiology, Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital, Paris, France, 3Rene Descartes Paris 5 University, Paris, FranceBackground and AimsThe aim of the study is to determine if nutrition during the first month of life is significantly associated with growth and/or pulmonary function at 1 year of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).MethodsGrowth and pulmonary function at 1 year were prospectively assessed for 27 preterm infants (mean GA ± SD = 27.6±1.9wks; birth weight = 851±174g) with BPD (i.e., O2 requirement for more than 28 days). Growth z-scores were calculated by using the EuroGrowth Project growth curves. Functional residual capacity (FRC) was assessed (n=27) with the nitrogen washout method and the partial forced expiratory flow (Vmax FRC) (n=23) with the jacket method. Total energy and protein intakes during the first 5 weeks of life were determined from the medical chart.The Influence of Different Ventilatory Modes on Calorimetry Using A New Compact Modular Metabolic Monitor in Critically Ill ChildrenG Briassoulis, E Mihailoudi, E Vasilaki, A M SpanakiPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Heraklion, Crete, GreeceBackground and AimsTo assess the influence of different ventilatory modes on VCO2, VO2, and respiratory quotient (RQ) using a new compact modular metabolic monitor (M-COVX) and its impact on measured resting energy expenditure (MEE).MethodsThe REE was measured at three different modes of ventilation (PRVC, SIMV, BIVENT) and compared to equations commonly used to predict resting energy expenditure (REE) in mechanically ventilated children.Maternal and Perinatal Factors affecting Breast Feeding Initiation in Crete, GreeceF Ladomenou1, A G Kafatos2, E Galanakis11Department of Paediatrics, University of Crete, Greece, 2Department of Social Medicine, University of Crete, GreeceBackground and AimsUnderstanding the factors that promote or prevent from breast feeding initiation in a given society may substantially contribute to better breastfeeding rates. The aim of this study was to assess breast feeding rates in Crete, Greece and to identify maternal and perinatal factors influencing the maternal decision to breastfeed or not breastfeed.MethodsA prospective cohort study using both a questionnaire and follow-up telephone interviews. Setting: Public and private maternity wards of Heraklion, Crete, Greece. A sample of 1,049 mothers in early parturition was interviewed during their stay in the maternity ward.

Leptin is implicated in appetite control, temperature upregulation and energy expenditure. Our study’s aim was to determine the impact of feeding on leptin secretion in a population of preterm neonates.MethodsLeptin study was a prospective one, enrolling 87 preterms born at the hospital. Ethics Committee Approval and parental informed consent were obtained. Eligible neonates were all preterms (&lt;37 weeks of gestation, according to Dubowitz criteria). All neonates were fed within 4–6 hours after birth the same volume according to weight and day. For example on day 1 they received 30 ml/kg with an increment of 30 ml/kg/per day till maximum 250 ml/kg/per day. Neonates were fed the same formula and breast fed infants were excluded as well as those with respiratory distress, birth injury, vomiting, diarrhea, necrotising enterocolitis. Blood sampling during the first 6 hours of life and repeated sampling on day 26 of feeding for serial leptin measurements.Antioxidant and Peroxide Content of Milk from Mothers who Delivered at Term and Preterm Newborn InfantsD Turoli, M Condo’, R Zanini, R Bellu’NICU, Ospedale ‘Manzoni’, Lecco, ItalyBackground and AimsEvidence indicates that source of oxidants can be a challenge to the immature antioxidant defenses of the newborn infant and that human milk contains many antioxidant considered to prevent diseases mediated by oxygen free radicals in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. In previous studies we investigated human and formula milk antioxidant and peroxide load. In the present study we investigated antioxidant and peroxide load of preterm vs term human milk.MethodsWe measured with spectrophotometric methods the lipid peroxides (LPOx), conjugated diene (CD) and T-BARS (pro-oxidants) and the total antioxidant activity (TAA) content of 26 milk samples, 10 from mothers who delivered at term newborns and 16 from mothers who delivered preterm (24–32 weeks gestational age) newborns. Mean values and standard deviations were calculated and analyzed by Student’s t-test.Comparison of Axillary, Abdominal and Skin Shin Temperature as Well as Spectroscopic Capillary Reactivity (CR) Measurements for Early Detection of Sepsis in Extremely Low Birth Weight Infants (ELBW)J R Fernandez Alvarez1, F E Lawson1, P Amess1, H Jungmann2, H Rabe11Trevor Mann Baby Unit, Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, East Sussex, UK, 2Institute for Cancer Research, University of Bochum, Nordrhein-Westfalen, GermanyBackground and AimsMicrocirculation is impaired in sepsis. The non-invasive spectroscopic device Mediscan-2000 detects changes in CR earlier than clinical capillary refill time in sepsis. It measures total haemoglobin in capillaries using a probe with a short pathlength. In term newborns measurement of central/peripheral temperature gradient helps recognising sepsis. The axilla is useful for core temperature monitoring in afebrile neonates. Aim was to assess the value of axillary and central/peripheral temperature measurements in ELBW newborns in comparison to CR measured by Mediscan-2000 in sepsis.MethodsAxillary, abdominal skin and shin temperatures were recorded when bloods taken for sepsis. Within 2h spectroscopic measurement of CR was performed at the forearm using a defined pressure stimulation. Time between end of pressure stimulation and resulting peak of CR was calculated. Infants served as their own controls without sepsis. Results are given as median.Do Prenatal Growth and Illness Influence Postnatal Undernutrition?I Dorronsoro Martin1, M Saenz de Pipaon Marcos1, J Perez Rodriguez1, R Madero Jarabo2, M Biarge Martinez1, J Quero Jimenez11Department of Neonatology, La Paz Hospital, Madrid, Spain, 2Department of Research, La Paz Hospital, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsDescribe postnatal growth of preterm very low birth weight infants (VLBWI). Evaluate the impact of prenatal growth, maturity, acute and chronic illness in postnatal growth.MethodsRetrospective analysis of VLBWI with gestational age (GA) under 33 weeks born at a single institution between 2002 and 2005. Growth was evaluated at birth, 28 days of postnatal life and 36 weeks of postconceptional age. Acute illness was defined as the need of mechanical ventilation for more than three days (MV), high frequency ventilation (HFV) or late sepsis. Chronic illness was defined as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Prenatal growth was evaluated by Z score at birth. We defined small for gestational age (SGA) as birth weight (BW) under 10 percentil (Alexander curves). Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS.The Effect of Body Mass Index on Thyroid Function in Adolescent GirlsM H Eftekhari1, F Shidfar21Dept of Nutrition, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, School of Health, 2Dept of Nutrition, Iran University of Medical Sciences, School of Health, Tehran, IranBackground and AimsLittle is known about thyroid function in obese adolescents.

Antithrombin (AT) is the most important natural inhibitor of the coagulation cascade. While inherited deficiency of AT is rare in the general population, acquired deficiency is frequently observed in patients with liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, and after major surgery, particularly cardiac surgery. The study determines whether increased AT loss is present in newborn and children with chylothorax after cardiac surgery.MethodsThe plasma and pleural effusion samples of children with chylothorax and with non-chylous pleural effusion were assayed for AT activity. Chylous samples were collected on day 2 to 4 postoperatively when chylothorax diagnosis was confirmed.Way of Delivery as well as Mode of Feeding Seem to Influence the Fecal Level of Calprotectin in NeonatesS J Moltu1, M Eggesboe2, B Kvenshagen3, M K Fagerhol1, J Rugtveit11Ullevål University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, 2Institute of Public Health, Oslo, Norway, 3Central Hospital Østfold, Fredrikstad, NorwayBackground and AimsTo study the fecal level of calprotectin in relation to mode of delivery and feeding, both factors reported to influence type of bacterial gut colonization and thus potentially also the granulocyte reponse.MethodsWe measured fecal calprotectin values in spot samples of faeces from 244 infants at age 4, 10, 30 and 120 days. Wilcoxon signed rank test and Mann-Whitney U Test were used for comparisons.Sustained, Functional and Mature CD8+ T Cell Populations after Viral Infection in InfancyH Komatsu1, A Inui2, T Sogo2, T Fujisawa31Department of Paediatrics, Sakura Hospital, Toho University, Sakura, Chiba, Japan, 2Department of Paediatrics, Yokohama Sakae Kyosai Hospital, Yokohama, Kanagawa, Japan, 3Department of Paediatrics, Atami Hospital, International University of Health and Welfare, Atami, Shizuoka, JapanBackground and AimsCellular immunity plays a crucial role in the cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and substantial populations of CMV-specific T cells accumulate throughout life. However, although CMV infection occurs during childhood, little is know about the quality of T cell responses in pediatric populations.MethodsWe screened a large Japanese population (1036 individuals) and analysed the CD8+ T cell responses to CMV, comparing these to responses in children, young and elderly adults. The frequencies, phenotype and function CD8+ T cells for two immunodominant epitopes from pp65 were measured cross-sectionally.Anti-Annexin V Antibodies in Women with Spontaneous Abortions and Premature BirthsK Malickova1,2, R Svancarova1, K Masova1, I Janatkova11Laboratory of Clinical Immunology and Allergology, Institute of Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Diagnostics, General Faculty Hospital and 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, 2Institute of Immunology and Microbiology, General Faculty Hospital and 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech RepublicBackground and AimsAnnexin V is a phospholipid-binding glycoprotein with anticoagulant activity. It is expressed by trophoblast cells and its preferential binding substrate is phosphatidylserine. As the gamete is fertilized, the trophoblast expresses phosphatidylserine for binding to the endometrial surface. In the normal embryo, annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine as a protective anticoagulant mechanism. In women with recurrent fetal losses, placental annexin V is decreased. We have conducted a study on the prevalence of serum anti-annexin V antibodies in relation to pregnancy failures in women with and without the history of fetal losses and/or premature births.MethodsWe have screened serum samples of 13 women (29.7 +/− 2.3 years of age) with no antecedent of thromboembolic or autoimmune diseases but manifest recurrent pregnancy losses and/or premature births; 14 serum samples of women (33.7 +/− 4.2 years) with sterility but without history of fetal losses; and serum samples of 14 women (38.4 +/− 7.3 years) with SLE and no coincidental history of reproductive failure. IgG and IgM anti-annexin V, anti-cardiolipin, anti-phosphatidylserine and anti-ethanolamine antibodies were determined in all serum samples, with no awareness of the outcome of pregnancies.Treatment of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma with BFM Protocols in Hungary — Experience of Fifteen YearsJ Müller, Z Jakab, M Csóka, H Erlaky, T Constantin, A Ponyi, G T Kovács2nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Budapest, HungaryBackground and AimsIn the last 15 years Hungarian children with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) were treated according to the Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster (BFM) German protocols. Aim of the present study was to summarize our experience with these protocols, to assess the survival rates and to compare the Hungarian data with the international results.MethodsBetween 1990 and 2004 230 children, diagnosed with NHL were treated according to BFM protocols in Hungary.

Until now, postnatal diagnosis was made by the detection of specific antibodies, nevertheless transplacentally acquired maternal IgG can interfere at this level and neonatal IgM or IgA production can be largely variable. Furthermore, current diagnostic methods are not sufficiently sensitive and frequently fail to establish the diagnosis before one year of age: tests for IgM and IgA antibodies identify up to 75% infected babies. The aim of our study was to evaluate the specific cellular immunity to T. gondii antigens in newborns with different immunological assays, in order to provide an accurate diagnosis of congenital infection as early as possible.MethodsWe tested IFN-g production, T lymphocyte proliferation and the expression of activation antigens CD25 and HLA-DR on T lymphocyte membrane on infected and non infected neonates at different ages.Usefulness of Tuberculin Skin Test for Diagnosis of Latent Tuberculosis Infection Among School Aged Internationally Adopted ChildrenO Gkika, G Z Zantopoulos, N Manakou, S Liosi, P Anastasopoulou, A Giannisi, Z PatronaDepartment of Paediatrics, General Hospital of Korinthos, Korinthos, GreeceBackground and AimsTuberculosis remains a leading cause of death from any single infectious disease accounting for over a quarter of all avoidable deaths. Children with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) represent the future reservoir from which adult cases will arise. This study aims to describe the incidence and to investigate the usefulness of tuberculin skin test (TST) for diagnosis of LTBI among internationally adopted children of our area.MethodsTST reaction size was recorded for 100 school aged internationally adopted children ranging in age from 6 to 14 years old. Two groups of children were identified: First group (A) consisted of 54 children that were born in Greece and weren’t BCG immunized and the second group (B) included 46 children who were born in a TB endemic country, had at least one foreign parent and were BCG immunized at birth.Levels of Anticapsular Antibodies Before and After the Administration of Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine in Greek ChildrenA A Gatsouli1, E V Liatsis2, F A Haliotis1, M N Tzanoudaki2, S A Avlonitis1, M G Kanariou21Second Department of Pediatric Clinics, Aghia Sophia Children’s Hospital, Athens, Greece, 2Departments of Immunology and Histocompatibility, Aghia Sophia Children’s Hospital, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsThe recent wide application of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7-PCV) has contributed in the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease. And in certain countries is recommended for all children under 2 years of age. The schedule for 7-PCV is 4 doses if started under 7 months of age but older children need less doses. This study is designed to evaluate the quantitative response of the antibody against Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, before and after the administration of 7-PCV in children 1–4 years old and the correlation of the results with age and dose regimen.MethodsBlood was drawn from 22 Greek children before and 3–4 weeks after the administration of 7-PCV. The children were classified in two age groups: A:6 children 12–23 months and B:16 children 2–4 years old. Group A received two 7-PCV doses, while Group B received one dose of the vaccine. Pneumococcal anticapsular antibodies (anti-PCP) were measured in serum by an enzyme immunoassay (ELISA). Antibody response to 7-PCV was estimated using an antibody increase factor (IF) which was calculated as follows: IF=anti-PCPafter7-PCV/anti-PCPbefore 7-PCV.Changes of Immunity Parameters Caused By Congenital or Early Postnatal Cytomegalovirus InfectionJ Dort1, V Gutova2, E Dortova1, M Svecova31Department of Neonatology, Charles University Hospital, Plzen, Czech Republic, 2Institution of Immunology and Allergy, Charles University Hospital, Plzen, Czech Republic, 3Institution of Microbiology, Charles University Hospital, Plzen, Czech RepublicBackground and AimsCMV is the most frequent cause of congenital infections. Prematurity itself brings immunodeficiency due to immaturity of immune system that can facilitate infection process. Moreover, CMV infection can further compromise the immune system of premature infants. To assess changes of humoral and cellular immunity parameters in infants with congenital and early postnatal cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. To use the results as a tool for better timing of vaccination in premature infants.MethodsAssessment of humoral and cellular immunity parameters — IgG, IgA, IgM levels, T and B lymphocytes, NK cells, T lymphocytes subpopulations, T lymphocytes transformation after mitogen stimulation — in a group of infants with congenital or early acquired postnatal CMV infection at 1 year of corrected age. Results are compared with age specific normal values. The intensity of urine CMV shedding served as marker of the CMV infection activity. The examination was made from treatment reasons in the sake of patients, not for study reasons.Protection of Immunodeficient Children from Haemophilus Influenzae InfectionsK S Mironska, S Peova, K Stavric, L Kareva Department of Immunology, Clinic for Children’s Diseases, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsHaemophilus Influenzae is one of the most important bacterial agents of upper respiratory tract infections, and one of the main causes of severe invasive bacterial disease in children under 6 years of age. With introduction of conjugated polisaharide Hib vaccine, protection from this serious agent is achieved. The aim was to protect our immunodeficient patients or patients with suspected immunodeficiency suffering of frequent upper respiratory tract infections caused with Haemophilus Influenzae type b with Hib vaccine, because regular immunization against this agent in our country is not introduced yet.MethodsOn the Department of Immunology at the Clinic for Children’s Disease in Skopje, 67 patients, aged from 1 to 5 years, were immunized with conjugated Hib vaccines. They were followed up during the next 24 hours, and then, every 3 months in the next two years.Toxic Shock Syndrome Versus Kawasaki DiseaseC Goni-Orayen1, M Herranz-Aguirre1, A Perez-Martinez2, J Rodriguez-Ozcoidi1, G Duran-Urdaniz3, A J Cabria-Fernandez31Pediatric Service, 2Pediatric Surgery Service, Virgen del Camino Hospital, Pamplona, 3Pediatric Service, Garcia Orcoyen Hospital, Estella, Navarra, SpainBackground and AimsDiagnosis of toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is based on clinical criteria. It has similarities with diseases that are mediated by toxins, both from the clinical and the immunological points of view. Proinflammatory cytokines play a role in the pathogenics, similar to what occurs in Kawasaki’s disease (KD), which is also diagnosed clinically.MethodsA four-year-old girl with high fever, vomiting, abdominalgia, and headache for 48 hours, was referred to our hospital. She presented conjunctival hyperemia without secretion, very hyperemic oral mucosa, dry cracking lips and palmoplantar erythema. On admission temperature was 39 C, heart rate 145 bpm, and blood pressure 95/60 mmHg. She had not urinated since the night before admission.Infections ‘factors of Provocation for Small Blood Vessels Endothelial Injury’ M. KawasakiZ Rajcanovska, B Filipova, K Bakieva- Bojcevska, Z Trpkovski, V TrpkovskaZdravstven Dom Negotino, Faculty of Medicine, Skopje, Negotino, MacedoniaBackground and AimsThe endothelium of blood vessels has important role in forming of immunological response, its modulation and regulation. The immunological response has manifestation of vasculitis, purpura, etc. Our aim is to present ‘the path’ of our patient to the final diagnosis and all differential diagnostic problems.MethodsOur patient was 11 months male baby, extremely upset, with high temperature and enlarged-swollen neck noduli lymphatici. He has been ambulatory treated with antibiotics for seven days without any results. The second day after hospitalization exanthema rash showed up all over the body. The treatment with anti allergic therapy showed no results, too. Punction of the neck noduli lymphatici was realized without any suppuration — it eliminated neck’s phlegmona. The consultation with ORL specialist and infectiologist from Clinical center- Skopje didn’t give final diagnosis. The baby was transported to the Clinic of Pediatrics in Skopje in difficult condition. Several diagnoses have lead us to diagnosis of M.

Injury often involves periventricular white matter tracts, which are essential for speech and language functions. The study aimed to carry out a comprehensive assessment of speech, language and literacy abilities in preterm children aged 10–16 years with perinatal brain injury, and investigate associations with structural and functional imaging findings.MethodsA cross sectional study of a cohort of children born &lt;33 weeks gestation treated at a single tertiary neonatal unit. Children with unilateral or bilateral lesions on neonatal cranial ultrasound were eligible for inclusion in the study. Outcome was assessed using standardised tests of auditory processing (SCAN-A), speech (VMPAC, GFTA) and language functions including tests of grammar (TROG-2), expressive and receptive language (CELF-3 UK, EOWPVT, ROWPVT), and phonological (CTOPP) and literacy (WORD) abilities. Neuroimaging included conventional structural MRI (T1, T2 weighted sequences) for visual assessment of lesions, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) for assessment of white matter integrity, and functional MRI (fMRI) to determine language lateralisation and reorganisation.Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Extremely Low Gestational Age Infants. A Population Based Study from StockholmB Skiöld1, J Bengtsson2, S Horsch1, B Hallberg3, Z Nagy2, B Nordell2, A Nordell2, M Mosskin4, H Lagercrantz1, M Blennow3, U Ådén11Institution Women and Child Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Department of Medical Physics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 3Institution CLINTEC, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden, 4Department of Neuroradiology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsThe aim of this study was to investigate white matter (WM) abnormalities in a cohort of extremely low gestational age infants (ELGA &lt;27+0w) born in Stockholm 2004–2006.Methods61 infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, Philips Intera 1.5T) at term-equivalent age and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI, 6 diffusion directions) data of high quality was acquired in 32 infants with mean gestational age (GA) 25+3w (23+5–26+6). Four regions of interest were chosen: The genu and the splenium of corpus callosum, the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) and the total WM at the level of centrum semiovale. Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) and Fractional Anisotropy (FA) values were measured.Long-Term Effect of Zinc Supplementation on Growth and Mental Development of Preterm Infants At Four Years of AgeN M Díaz-Gómez2, E Doménech1, F Barroso1, C Cortabarría1, I Ayala11Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, University of La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain, 2Nursing School, University of La Laguna, Tenerife, SpainBackground and AimsPrevious studies have shown that zinc supplementation has a positive short-term influence on growth; however, the long-term effect of zinc on growth and mental development of preterm infants has not been well studied, and these were our aims.MethodsWe studied 40 preterm infants fed with a standard term-infant formula supplemented with zinc (SG, n=20, BW:1645+440 g; GA: 32.2+2.3 w) or without supplementation (CG, n= 20, BW: 1700+326 g.; GA: 32.1+2.0 w) from 36 weeks postconceptional age until 6 months corrected postnatal age (CA). At 9 and 12 months CA and at 4 years of age anthropometric variables and total body water (TBW) estimated by bioelectrical impedance (BI) were measured. Mental development (McCarthy scale) was evaluated at four years of age.Evidence of A Sensitive Period for Olfactory Learning by Human NewbornsO Romantshik1, R H Porter2, H Varendi11Department of Paediatrics, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, 2CNRS-INRA, UMR 6175, Nouzilly, FranceBackground and AimsThe olfactory system is functional at birth and learned responses to odours have been demonstrated during the first postnatal days. Labour contractions and vaginal delivery activate the locus coeruleus and result in a massive release of norepinephrine that rapidly declines during the first 1–2 hours after birth. Norepinephrine and locus coeruleus activity have been implicated in olfactory learning in rodent pups. We therefore hypothesized that a brief window of time immediately after delivery may be a particularly sensitive period for the development of olfactory learning by human neonates.MethodsVaginally delivered infants were exposed to an odorant for 30 min. Beginning 4–54 min. after birth (Early exposure) or 12-h post-partum (Late exposure). Several days later they were tested for their responses to the exposure odour versus an unfamiliar odour or an odourless control stimulus.Is Histological Chorioamnionitis A Neuroprotective Factor for ELBW?F Decobert, D Ciocca, V Champion, G Dassieu, C DananCentre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil, FranceBackground and AimsThe rapid evolution in the care of extremely premature babies requires evaluation of neurological outcome of infants treated. This study aims to evaluate known and possible risk factors of poor neurological outcome in a population of inborn ELBW &lt;28wk GA. Using an ongoing systematic study of placentas, we tried to evaluate the role of histological chorioamnionitis (CAM) as a risk factor for poor neurological outcome.MethodsRetrospective monocentric study. Neurological outcome was assessed at minimum age one year or later. A logistic regression model was used to analyse perinatal data, medical interventions and postnatal morbidity. Histological analysis of the placenta for CAM was available for 90% of the population.Quality of General Movements at Postnatal Day 1 in Preterm InfantsJ L M Bruggink, H J ter Horst, T Tameling, C V Hulzebos, A F BosDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsA reliable method to assess the presence of brain damage in infants is Prechtl’s method of the qualitative judgement of general movements (GMs). The quality of GMs in preterm infants at postnatal day 1 has not been investigated so far. Our aim was to determine the quality of GMs in preterm infants at postnatal day 1, and its relationship with perinatal variables.MethodsIn 27 preterm infants, video recordings of GMs were performed within 24h after birth and at weekly intervals. The quality of GMs was assessed as normal, abnormal or hypokinesia (H). Normal GMs are movements that involve the whole body in a complex sequence with variable intensity, force and speed. Abnormal GMs lack complexity and variability. H is defined as absence of GMs during at least 45 minutes recording.Behavioural Problems in Extremely Preterm InfantsP Kutz1, S Horsch2, C Roll11Department of Neonatology, Children’s Hospital Datteln, University Witten/Herdecke, Witten, Germany 2University Children’s Hospital, Essen, GermanyBackground and AimsBehavioural problems in extremely preterm infants had not been paid much attention to, although parents often focus on this issue. We aimed to examine the prevalence of behavioural problems in a cohort of extremely preterm infants.MethodsData from all liveborn infants (GA &lt;27 wk) born 2000 to 2002 at University Hospital Essen were recorded. Survivors had been followed-up by clinical examination and Bayley Scales II. Additionally, at 17 to 59 months corrected age, child behaviour was evaluated by Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL) filled out by the mothers.Outcome of Infants &lt; 27 Weeks Gestational AgeL Kühn1, P Kutz2, C Roll11University Children’s Hospital, Essen, Germany 2Department of Neonatology, Children’s Hospital Datteln, University of Witten/Herdecke, Witten, GermanyBackground and AimsFollow-up data show a constantly high rate of disability among extremely preterm infants. Therefore, it is important to assess short- and long-term outcome regularly to detect changes.MethodsData from liveborn infants (GA &lt;27 wk) born 01/2003 to 06/2004 were recorded. Children were assessed at 18 months (17–22) corrected age by clinical examination, Bayley Scales II, Child Behaviour Check List (CBCL), assessment of height, body weight, head circumference.Association Between IL-6 -174 Polymorphisms and Cystic Periventricular Leukomalacia in Preterm InfantsA Radinger1, B Resch1, C Mannhalter2, B Horvath2, A Binder1, W Zenz1, W Walcher3, B Pertl3, W D Mueller11Department of Paediatrics, Medical University Graz, Graz, Austria, 2Department of Laboratory Medicine, Medical University Vienna, Vienna, Austria 3Department of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Medical University Graz, Graz, AustriaBackground and AimsThe fetal inflammatory response syndrome plays a central role in the pathogenesis of white matter damage, i.e. cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) in the preterm infant. High levels of proinflammatory cytokines including interleukin-6 (IL-6) have been observed in autopsies of brains of these infants. Thus, an association between IL-6 -174 (G/G, G/C or C/C) polymorphism, affecting IL-6 transcription rate and plasma cytokine levels, and development of PVL might be hypothesized.MethodsThe study group (cases) compromised infants with diagnosis of cystic PVL out of a single centre cohort from 1988 to 2005 and their parents. The control group (controls) included healthy newborns born between April and June 2002. Analysis of IL-6 -174 polymorphisms was performed in cases and their parents from venous blood samples after parental informed consent and in controls from umbilical cord blood samples. Samples were stored at −200 Celsius. IL-6 genotyping was performed using a polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) technique. The study was approved by the local ethic committee.Prognostic Value of Cerebral Ultrasound Isolated Ventriculomegaly at Discharge in VLBW InfantsM Lopez1, J de la Cruz2, C R Pallas1, E Gomez1, C Gallego3, D Lora21Department of Neonatology, 2Clinic Epidemiology Unit, 3Deparment of Radiology, Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsParenchymal lesions and intraventricular haemorrhages in neonatal cerebral ultrasound (US) are known as the most informative neonatal prognostic findings. The prognostic value of US ventriculomegaly is less documented. To estimate developmental delay (DD) and cerebral palsy (CP) occurrence at two years in children with isolated ventriculomegaly at discharge vs. no abnormal US findings.MethodsCohort study of VLBW or &lt; 32 weeks infants born in a single center (1991–2002). Data were collected prospectively on US protocolised exams at 2, 7, 28 days and at discharge: for each type of lesion, the more severe was included. DD and motor development were assessed at two years as part of a standardised follow-up programme.Triplets’ Developmental Disadvantage — Is it all About Perinatal Morbidity?A M Graca1, C B Lima2, P Gomes3, F Torgal Garcia2, R Gouveia2, L J Da Silva11Neonatal Unit, Department of Pediatrics, 2Child Developmental Clinic, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de Santa Maria, 3Department of Preventive Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, PortugalBackground and AimsThe risks of triple pregnancies are related to perinatal morbidity, but several other factors can influence development. The aims of this study are: 1) To identify significant perinatal and postnatal variables on triplets’ development; 2) To compare development of triplets followed at the Developmental Clinic with those not followed and with age-matched controls.MethodsWe assessed retrospectively 15 sets of triplets born between 1998 and 2004. The triplets were divided in Group A (9 sets) followed at Developmental Clinic and Group B (6 sets), called for evaluation later. Medical records were reviewed for perinatal variables. Griffiths’ scale was used for developmental assessment. Both groups were compared with each other and with age-matched control groups. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 12, considering significant p&lt;0.05.Efficacy of Solkoseryl in Treatment of Newborns with Hypoxic-Ishemic EncephalopathyF S Shamsiev, B A BurovTashkent Medical Institute of Postgraduate Education, Tashkent, UzbekistanBackgroundand AimsHemorheological and metabolic disorders in hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy require the beginning of early correction of these disorders as soon as possible and explains the search of new methods of treatment for newborns with this pathology.MethodsTo evaluate efficacy of Solkoseryl in the complex therapy of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in newborns. Thirty newborns with hypoxic encephalopathy were studied. Solkoseryl was prescribed in dose 0.3–0.5 ml (4% solution) per kg/body mass in a day. The indications for prescription were marked hypoxic-ischemic disorders identified with use of neurosonography, computed tomography and dopplerography. Solkoseryl was prescribed during the period of ear rehabilitation of hypoxic-ischemic disorders. The course of treatment was 10–20 injections. If it was necessary the course of therapy repeated every 4–6 weeks. Therapy was performed in 30 preterm infants.Influence of Therapeutic Touch in The Development of Premature NewbornsF León Larios, R Domínguez Rosales, M J Garzón Real, M T Ruíz Pérez, A A Rosado Poveda, M I Peñaloza Gómez, E Gonzales CaroNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, Virgin Macarena University Hospital, Seville, SpainBackgroundand AimsTo analyse the effectiveness of therapeutic touch on weight, number of postnatal complications, hospital stay and parent satisfaction of premature newborns.MethodsA random, controlled, experimental study in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit in Virgin Macarena University Hospital of premature newborns who are randomly assigned to the control group and who fulfil the established protocol of the inclusion criteria for the following two years of study. To determine the sample size, weight gain is used as the main variable. We are considering approximately 80 subjects in the study (40 per group), to try to find a minimum relevant difference of 50gr, considering an alpha 0.025 as a significant level, and a unilateral character of the test hypothesis potency at 80%. Data collection is done in a specifically designed registry, where the measures of variable results are reflected: Weight, postnatal complications, hospital stay, parent satisfaction and control variables. Statistical descriptions for the experimental and control group will be calculated. In order to compare quantitative information between the groups, a Student T test for independent samples or non parametric test U of Mann-Whitney.Maximum Length Sequence Baer in Preterm Infants after Perinatal Hypoxia-IschaemiaZ D Jiang1,2, D B Brosi1, X M Shao2, A R Wilkinson11Department of Paediatrics, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK, 2Children’s Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, ChinaBackgroundand AimsOur understanding of the influence of perinatal hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) on the brainstem in preterm infants remains very limited. To further the understanding we examined functional status of the auditory brainstem following high-rate click stimulation in preterm infants.MethodsThe subjects were 35 preterm infants who had clinical signs of perinatal HI and a depression of Apgar score (≤ 6 at 5 min), with gestation 28–36 wks. The controls were 35 age-matched preterm infants with no perinatal problems. Brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) was studied using maximum length sequence at 37–42 wks postconceptional age.Neonatal Hypotonia: Prevalence, Survival and Diagnostic ProcedureG H J M Leyten1, LA Bok2, M J de Kleine21Deventer Hospital, Deventer, The Netherlands 2Maxima Medical Center, Veldhoven, The NetherlandsBackgroundand AimsThe differential diagnosis of neonatal hypotonia is extensive. This complicates the diagnostic process, also the absence of a practical quickscan diagnostic procedure delays the diagnostic process. Survival is uncertain. Our aim was to evaluate retrospectively the relative prevalence, causes and survival of neonatal hypotonia in newborns admitted to a level three NICU.MethodsA retrospective cohort study of neonates presenting with neonatal hypotonia from January 1990 to January 1994 and from December 1996 to December 1999. Patients were subdivided into practical categories of neonatal hypotonia and the mortality rate was determined. The diagnostic procedure was evaluated.Developmental Age Influences Pathophysiological Response to Experimental Diffuse Traumatic Brain InjuryR Vink1,2, T Chang2,3, A I Faden2, F A Ahmed2, M I Cruz2, B Stoica2, I Cernak21Discipline of Pathology, University of Adelaide, Adelaide SA, Australia, 2Department of Neuroscience, Georgetown University, Washington, DC, USA 3Departments of Pediatrics and Neurology, Children’s National Medical Center, George Washington University Medical School, Washington, DC, USABackgroundand AimsTraumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most frequent cause of mortality and disability in children between 0–14 years of age. Although diffuse TBI represents the most common type of pediatric head trauma, there are few available experimental models to address the developmentally dependent response to such injury. We utilized a new rat model of diffuse TBI to study the graded response to head injury as a function of developmental age.MethodsTBI was induced in 7-day old rats using the Cernak diffuse injury model. Edema formation was assessed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, bioenergetic state by magnetic resonance spectroscopy, blood brain barrier permeability by extravasation of Evans blue, functional outcome by motor and cognitive tests, and morphological changes by histology and immunohistochemistry.Congenital Malformations — Incidence and Distribution Among Organ SystemsM Kalajdzieva-Zip, J Guleva, B Mihajlovic, V Delovska, T Pensovska, S Jusufi, M JegeniDepartment of Neonatology, Special Hospital for Gynaecology and Obstetrics CAIR, Skopje, MacedoniaBackgroundand AimsCongenital malformations (CM) are defined as abnormal structure of the organism resulting from disrupted embryogenesis. Regarding different criteria and authors, the incidence of CM at newborns is between 2 – 7%. The aim of this paper was to determine the incidence of CM at liveborns delivered at SHGO Cair, Skopje, during the five years period (2000–2004). Also, the distribution among organ systems had been analysed.MethodsA retrospective analysis of 19097 liveborns delivered at SHGO Cair, during 2000–2004, has been performed. Database (Access 2000) from Neonatal Unit has been used. The incidence and percentage of CM among different systems have been determined.Neonatal and Maternal Circulating Visfatin Levels in Normal and Intrauterine Growth Restricted PregnanciesA Malamitsi-Puchner1, D Gourgiotis2, M Boutsikou1, S Baka1, D Briana1, L Kontara1, M Kyriakakou1, A Marmarinos2, D Hassiakos11Neonatal Division, 2nd Department Obstetrics and Gynecology, Athens University, Athens, Greece 2Research Laboratories, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Athens, GreeceBackgroundand AimsVisfatin is a recently discovered cytokine that is preferentially produced in visceral adipose tissue. Its role appears to be controversial; on one hand, it facilitates fat deposition and increases in states of insulin resistance; on the other hand, it has been documented to exert insulin-mimetic effects in various tissues. This study aimed to investigate visfatin levels in full-term intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR- below the 10th customized centile) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses (UC) and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4) postpartum, as well as in their mothers (MS) before delivery.MethodsBlood serum visfatin levels were measured in 20 IUGR and 20 AGA mother-infant sets by enzyme immunoassay.Automatic Identification of Clinically Significant Changes in The Vital Signs of NeonatesJ Quinn1, C K I Williams1, B Wefers2, N McIntosh21School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, 2School of Clinical Sciences and Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UKBackgroundand AimsAlarms in a neonatal intensive care unit are triggered by vital signs measurements crossing preset thresholds. This is a crude way of drawing attention to changes in the physiological state of an infant, having low specificity and being affected by artifactual measurements. We aimed to construct a statistical model which could be used to infer clinically significant physiological changepoints at the cotside.MethodsA factorial switching Kalman filter (FSKF) was used to model monitoring data. In previous work such a model has been used to identify monitoring artifacts. An extra factor (referred to as the ‘X-factor’) was added, accounting for observations not corresponding to either a baby’s baseline dynamics or to any known artifactual patterns. Given test data, the FSKF can then infer the probability that the X-factor was active at any point. Eight test periods of monitoring data, 1–3 hours in duration and containing different types of physiological change, were taken from 4 infants. Measurements consisted of heart rate, blood pressures, and SpO2 sampled at 1 Hz. An experienced clinician annotated the times that significant physiological changes occurred, which was used as a gold standard.Pulse Oximeter Use in Neonatal Resuscitations: A Video AnalysisG Bernstein, M R Rasmussen, D M Kaegi, P M Tillson, E E Stout, C Joseph, P R WozniakNICU, Sharp Mary Birch Hospital for Women, San Diego, CA, USABackgroundand AimsP.Ox display of HR and SpO2 is a useful guide during intubation attempts (Intub) and surfactant administration (Surf). Video-recording of resuscitations enables critical review and quality improvement.MethodsWe evaluated HR and SpO2 values during resuscitations of 33 infants &lt; 1250 gm; 28 were intubated for surfactant. We video-recorded P.Ox readings combined with the baby using a specially designed mobile video system.Neonatal Outcomes in Assisted Twin Pregnancies: Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) Versus in Vitro Fertilization (IVF)A A Zuppa, V D’Andrea, A Scorrano, F Cota, C RomagnoliDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Catholic University of Sacred Heart, Rome, ItalyBackgroundand AimsThe Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) have become a routine infertility treatment. International data suggest the high rates of multiple pregnancies, prematurity, low birth-weight, and neonatal morbility in ART conceived births. The aim of this study is to compare perinatal and neonatal outcomes in IVF twin pregnancies to those conceived by ICSI delivered at Gemelli Hospital.MethodsWe studied 29 assisted twin pregnancies: 12 ICSI and 17 IVF. All twins were evaluated for prenatal outcomes (maternal age, pregnancy complications and placentation) and neonatal outcomes (gestational age, birth-weight, small-for-gestational-age (SGA), birthweight discordance &gt;20%, depression at birth, major neonatal diseases, NICU admissions and neonatal mortality).The Influence of Incubator Humidity on Weight Gain of Premature InfantsO K Helder1, J B Van Goudoever1, P G M Mulder21Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, University Medical Center Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackgroundand AimsVery low birth weight infants need close control of their thermal environment in order to maintain their optimal temperature. Transepidermal water loss plays an important role in energy loss in case the humidity setting is inadequate. An optimal humidity protocol could lead to a reduction of time to regain birth weight. Aim of this study is to compare the effect of a mandatory and free chosen incubator humidity strategy to increase weight in preterm infants within the first two weeks of life.MethodsTwo groups of premature infants of 24–30 weeks gestational age and with a birth weight less than 1500 gram were studied in a prospective randomized controlled way. The Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis was used to compare days to regain birth weight.Shorter Hospital Stay for Moderately Preterm InfantsM Altman1, M Vanpée2, A Bendito2, M Norman11Clintec, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden 2Department for Women and Child Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, SwedenBackgroundand AimsTo determine length of hospital stay (LOS) for moderately preterm infants during the last twenty years and to identify factors affecting the number of bed-days.MethodsReview of LOS for all infants delivered between 30 to 34 gestational weeks during 1983, 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2002. Exclusion criteria: life threatening abnormalities, chromosomal anomalies and death during hospitalization.Interim Report of Outcomes from A Multi-National Internet-Based Postgraduate Education Programme in NeonatologyM A Hall1, M Cuttini2, G Greisen3, M Marlow4, A Schulze5, S L Smith1, P Truffert6, A Valls I Soler71Department of Neonatal Medicine, The Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton, UK, 2Unit of Epidemiology, Paediatric Hospital Bambino Gesù, Rome, Italy 3Department of Neonatology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, 4School of Human Development, University of Nottingham, Department of Child Health, Queen’s Medical Centre, Nottingham, UK 5Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Division of Neonatology, Klinikum Grosshadern, University of Munich, Munich, Germany, 6Department of Neonatal Medicine, Hospital Jeanne de Flandre, University Hospital, Lille, France, 7Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Hospital de Cruces, Basque Country University Medical School, Bilbao, SpainBackgroundand AimsThe provision of a comprehensive programme of postgraduate education for trainees in neonatology can be a challenge for individual centres. Reasons for this include the small numbers of trainees in any one hospital and time constraints. The Internet offers the potential for the development of educational programmes which are standardised, flexible and widely accessible, irrespective of time and place. We report initial data concerning a multi-national European Commission funded project designed to provide a collaborative educational programme covering topics defined in the European training syllabus.MethodsSix modules, incorporating a range of multimedia and case-based scenarios, have been developed for delivery within a “virtual learning environment”. Topics include: neurology, ethics, epidemiology, nutrition, respiration and early care of the very low birthweight baby. Cross-cultural collaborative learning is promoted by internet-based discussions which are facilitated by a team of online tutors. Recruitment of trainees was via e-mail contact with members from the European Society of Paediatric Research (ESPR).Identification of C-Kit-Positive Cells in The Human Umbilical VeinN Linke1, Z Novák2, M Krecsmarik1, É Fekete1, H Orvos3, A Pál3, M Bagyánszki11Department of Zoology and Cell Biology, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary, 2Department of Pediatrics, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary, 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of Szeged, Szeged, HungaryBackgroundand AimsSteady blood flow between the foetus and the placenta is crucial for normal prenatal development. Since with the exception of the foetal end the umbilical cord lacks innervation, we hypothesised the presence of specialized pacemaker cells in the wall of the umbilical vessels that might contribute to the coordinated function of smooth muscle cells. C-kit protein is considered to be a specific marker for pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal tract, known as interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and c-kitimmunoreactive pacemaker cells have recently been discovered in the rabbit portal vein.MethodsC-kit antibody was used on paraffin and on ultrathin sections of umbilical veins obtained from normal-term vaginal deliveries. C-kit-immunoreactivity was visualized by diaminobenzidine (DAB) and 5nm gold-conjugated antibody.The Concept of Chronic Pain in The Neonate, A Delphi SurveyC J L M Van GanzewinkelNICU, Máxima Medical Centre, Veldhoven, The NetherlandsBackgroundand AimsA literature review revealed that the concept of chronic pain in the newborn has hardly received attention in pain research. Conceptualisation is required to develop evidence based pain assessment methods and to validate medical and nursing interventions.MethodsA Delphi survey consisting of 3 rounds was conducted in an international and multidisciplinary panel of experts. The first round consisted of three open-ended questions and aimed at identifying the opinion of the experts on the definition, aetiology and diagnostic determinants of chronic pain. The two subsequent rounds aimed at reaching consensus on the opinions.How Good Is Neonatal Hip Examination?M Vandeleur1, J F Murphy1, V B Donoghue21Department of Neonatology, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, 2Department of Radiology, The Childrens University Hospital, Dublin, IrelandBackgroundand AimsNeonatal clinical examination for developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) remains controversial in relation to its sensitivity and specificity. This study evaluates the accuracy of neonatal hip examination in detection of truly dislocated hips.MethodsInfants born National Maternity Hospital January 2004– December 2005 included. Following clinical suspicion of dislocated/dislocatable hip by consultant paediatrician, hip ultrasound day 3 performed. Infants with dislocated hips with dysplasia on ultrasound, treated with Pavlik harness; infants with dysplasia or mild instability followed with 8 week ultrasound or referred to orthopaedics. 8 week hip ultrasound performed for all infants with stable hips on exam but who met following criteria: (1) 1st degree relative with DDH; (2) breech; (3) persistant ‘click’. All ultrasounds performed by same consultant paediatric radiologist (VBD).Serum Albumin as A Predictor of Mortality in Preterm InfantsI Morris, E J MolloyDepartment of Neonatology, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, IrelandBackgroundand AimsAlbumin has long been recognised as a predictor of patient outcome in adult medicine. However, its use as a prognostic tool remains less clear in paediatrics, particularly in neonates. We aimed to evaluate the use of serum albumin in neonates as a predictor of morbidity and mortality.MethodsAll neonates &lt;1500g delivered in a tertiary referral centre were included over a 1 year period. The relationship between earliest and lowest recorded serum albumin levels and mortality and morbidity (incidence of IVH, NEC, and length of hospital stay) was evaluated.Early Blood Lactate Concentration and Crib Score as Predictors of Mortality in Very Low Birth Weight BabiesL Phillips, C Dewhurst, A P Ganesan, H Isaac, R W Cooke, C W YoxallDepartment of Neonatology, Liverpool Women’s Hospital, Liverpool, UKBackgroundand AimsEarly identification of very low birth weight (VLBW) babies with a high risk of mortality may be beneficial. Blood lactate concentrations ([L]) have been shown to be associated with adverse outcomes in other critically ill patient groups. The aim of this study was to investigate the predictive value of [L] in VLBW babies and to compare this with CRIB score.MethodsAll babies admitted to the neonatal unit with a birth weight of less than 1501 grams during 2001–2004 were included. CRIB score, [L] in the first 12 hours and clinical outcome were obtained.Fetal Acid-Base Status at Birth and Early Neonatal Outcome after General and Neuraxial Anaesthesia in Women Undergoing Elective Caesarean Section at TermG Tonni1, C De Felice2, A Ventura11Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Guastalla Civil Hospital, AUSL Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy 2Department of Neonatology, Policlionic Hospitla ‘Le Scotte’, University of Siena, Siena, ItalyBackgroundand AimsA prospective study involving 900 uneventful, term, singleton pregnancies undergoing elective Caesarean section. The aim of the study was to evaluate if acid-base status at birth and early neonatal outcome were statistically different in women undergoing general vs spinal and epidural anesthesia.MethodsAcid-base assessment at birth was derived from blood samples obtained either from umbilical cord artery and vein. Neonatal outcome measurements considered were 1- and 5-min Apgar score ≤3, transfer to NICU, need for ventilation, neonatal seizures, hypotonia and coma, neonatal hypoglicemia and survival.End Tidal Carbon Monoxide (ETCO) Excretion in Infants Exposed to PhototherapyM Barak1,2, Y Littner1,2, S Dollberg1,2, F Mimouni1,21Department of Neonatology, Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Lis Maternity Hospital, 2Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv, IsraelBackgroundand AimsIt has been suggested that phototherapy might increase hemolysis, due to increase in heme oxygenase activity and/or oxidative injury to the red blood cells membrane. The objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that ETCO concentrations, an index of hemoglobin degradation, increase during phototherapy and decrease after its interruption in jaundiced neonates.MethodsETCOc concentration was measured using a CO breath analyzer, in 38 infants who developed hyperbilirubinemia requiring phototherapy. ETCOc measurements were performed before and at 12, 24 and 48 hours of phototherapy and again before phototherapy interruption and 12 hours afterward. Analyses were by repeated measures ANOVA.Apgar Scores and Early Neonatal BiochemistryC De Felice1, G Tonni2, A Del Vecchio3, G Latini3,41Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, 2Div. of Obstetrics and Gynecology Guastalla Civil Hospital, AUSL Reggio Emilia, 3Div. of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, 4Clinical Physiology Institute, Nat’l Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Lecce Section, ItalyBackgroundand AimsThe 10-point Apgar score has successfully been used to assess the conditions and prognosis of newborn infants since &gt;50 years. However, the relationship between Apgar scores and early neonatal biochemistry remains unclear.MethodsA total of 750 newborns (gestational age: 38.77 ± 2.25 wk; birth weight 3195 ± 610 g) were evaluated for Apgar scores at 1-min (APG-1) and 5-min (APG-5) of life. Biochemical data were assessed by micro-methods on capillary blood sampling 1 h after birth. Associations between APG-1 or APG-5 and biochemical variables were tested using Spearman’s coefficient of rank correlation (rho).The Skin Color Component of The Apgar Score: A Quantitative Spectrophotometric ApproachC De Felice1, A Barducci2,3, P Corrocher4, G Tonni5, G Latini6,7, R Casini81Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, 2Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara”, Nat’l Research Council of Italy, Florence, 3Dept of Information Engineering, University of Siena, 4IntexSystem, Prato, 5Div. of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Guastalla Hospital, Guastalla-Reggio Emilia, 6Div. of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, 7Clinical Physiology Inst., Nat’l Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Lecce Section, 8Te&amp;Co, Prato, ItalyBackgroundand AimsThe value of the subjective color component of Apgar score remains controversial. Our aim was to objectively evaluate skin color in the Apgar color classes: 0 (“blue” or pale) −1 (“pink” body with “blue” extremities)-2 (entire body “pink”).MethodsSkin color at 1, 5, and 10 min was rated in Caucasian term newborns (n=50) and simultaneously measured at 3 body sites (abdomen, hand, and foot) with a portable spectrophotometer unit (400–700 nm wavelengths range; standard D65 illuminant). “Pink” control newborns (n= 50; age: 4 h) were also measured. Spectral reflectance curves were analyzed and distances ( E) between colors for different body sites and color classes were calculated (Colormedica software package, IntexSystem).Candida Versus Bacterial Late-Onset Sepsis in Very Low Birth Weight Infants in Israel: A National SurveyI R Makhoul1, Y Bental2, M Weisbrod2, P Sujov1, A Lusky3, B Reichman31Department of Neonatology, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel, 2Department of NeOnatology, Laniado Hospital, Netanya, Israel, 3Women and Children’s Health Research Unit, Gertner Institute, Tel-Hashomer, IsraelBackgroundand AimsSepsis due to fungi accounts for 9–12% of late-onset sepsis (LOS) among very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this population-based study was to evaluate the perinatal and neonatal risk factors for fungal LOS, as compared to bacterial LOS, in VLBW infants.MethodsThis is a population-based observational study including all VLBW infants born in all 28 NICUs in Israel. From 1995 through 2002, the Israel National VLBW infant database gathered information on 11830 infants. The study population comprised 3054 infants with one or more events of LOS. Univariate analysis and logistic regression models were used to compare infants with fungal sepsis only (n=179) and those with bacterial sepsis only (n=2630), regarding various perinatal and neonatal risk factors.Maternal Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Neutralizing Antibodies and Congenital InfectionA Y Yamamoto1, N R Barbieri1, V M Wagatsuma1, G Duarte2, M M Mussi-Pinhata11Department of Pediatrics, 2Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Faculty of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, Hospital das Clínicas, Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, BrazilBackgroundand AimsCMV specific humoral immunity in pregnant women may play a role against viral reactivation and congenital infection. We compared CMV neutralizing (NTR) antibody titers between transmitter (T) and non-transmitter (NT) mothers.MethodsSerum samples were obtained in the first weeks of pregnancy (median= 13 weeks) and at delivery from 26 mothers of infants identified as congenitally infected by CMV (T) and 26 mothers of non-infected infants (NT). CMV- neutralizing activity was quantified by a microneutralization assay in the presence of guinea pig complement with the AD169 CMV strain. In a subset of (T) mothers the neutralization assay was also performed with the viral isolate from the respective infant.Can We Reduce Antibiotic Usage in The Tertiary Neonatal UnitE M Stuwe1, M Horan1, R Mittal1, H Ibrahim1, S Paulus1, T J Neal2, C W Yoxall11Neonatal Unit, Liverpool Womens Hospital, Liverpool, Merseyside, UK, 2Department of Medical Microbiology, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Liverpool, Merseyside, UKBackgroundand AimsReducing the use of antibiotics in non-infected individuals has been identified as a potential strategy to reduce the emergence of multiresistant pathogens in the hospital environment. In response to local research and audit findings we have altered our practice: Antibiotics are stopped after 36hours if cultures are negative and the baby is well. A direct computer link between the blood culture analyser and the unit allows 24 hour access to blood culture status. An audit was performed to measure the impact of these changes on the number of antibiotic doses administered on our unit.MethodsThe case notes of a random 5% sample of babies with blood cultures taken before and after the new policies were examined. Demographics, clinical outcomes and number of antibiotic doses received by each baby were recorded.Clinical Availability of Neonatal Blood Culture Results in Less Than 48 HoursE A M Roell-Schorer, E J d’Haens, A J de Beaufort, A J SprijDepartment Neonatology, Leiden University Medical Centre, Juliana’s Children’s Hospital, The Hague, The NetherlandsBackgroundand AimsNeonates at risk for sepsis receive empirical antimicrobial treatment for 72 hours, pending negative culture results. Benefits to minimise treatment duration are evident. The Bactec 9240 detects 100% positive blood cultures within 30 hours. Thus, can length of antibiotic therapy be shortened in these neonates? The aim of this study is to determine the time at which neonatal blood cultures can be considered negative.MethodsIn a one-year (2005) prospective study we collected 249 blood cultures from neonates admitted to our neonatal unit. Time to positivity (TTP) (the time between culture sampling and the moment the neonatologist received the results) was calculated. Incubation time was automatically registered.Immigration from Eastern Europe: Reappearance of Congenital Syphilis in The Italian PopulationE Tridapalli, M G Capretti, M Stella, G Brighi, F Vitali, G FaldellaDepartment of Preventive Paediatrics and Neonatology, St. Orsola-Malpighi General Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna, ItalyBackgroundand AimsTo evaluate the prevalence of syphilis in pregnancy and congenital syphilis (CS) in an Italian city, in relation to the increased immigration flow.MethodsA prospective surveillance study was carried out in Bologna, Italy, from November 2000 to July 2005. All pregnant women were screened for syphilis at delivery by enzymatic immunoassay. Positive samples were then analysed by T. pallidum haemoagglutination assay (TPHA), Western Blot (WB) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests. Infants born to seropositive mothers were enrolled in a prospective follow-up.Treatment of Neonates with Central Venous Catheter Related Coagualsenegative Staphylococcal Sepsis Using Continuous-Infusion Vancomycin TherapyA B Kapetanakis, S Bradley, K FarrerRegional Neonatal Unit, St George’s Hospital, London, UKBackgroundand AimsCoagulase negative staphylococci (CONS) are the most common cause of catheter related blood stream infection (CR-BSI) in neonates. Removal of the central venous catheters (CVC's) is often necessary. Attempts to treat using conventional vancomycin dosing without removal of the CVC's have limited success. Vancomycin exhibits time dependent activity. Continuous infusion (CI) of the drug improves serum concentrations and bactericidal activity.MethodsProspective data collection from infants treated for CR-BSITreatment was commenced using CI Vancomycin administered via the CVC. All received a loading dose (15mg/kg) followed by CI. The starting doses were 15mg/kg/day–30mg/kg/day depending on initial serum creatinine level. Blood cultures where obtained before and during the antibiotic treatment, CRP and serum creatinine were monitored. Vancomycin levels were obtained at 24–48 hour intervals and the dose adjusted accordingly. Target Vancomycin concentrations were15–25mcg/ml.Role of Routine Lumbar Punctures in Neonatal Sepsis — Are They Justified?R F Kornelisse1, C E P M Duijsters21Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, University Medical Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Máxima Medisch Centrum, Veldhoven, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsNeonatal meningitis has a high mortality and frequent neurological sequelae. The importance of a lumbar puncture (LP) as part of the diagnostic evaluation of neonates with suspected sepsis has been subject of debate. Neonatologists often defer the LP when evaluating the very low birth weight (VLBW) infant (&lt;1500 gram). We evaluated the utility of LP's done routinely as part of complete workup in neonatal sepsis.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted to evaluate LP's performed in VLBW infants admitted between January 1, 1997, and January 1, 2004 who survived for at least 3 days at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital. Excluded were patients with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus requiring treatment. Late-onset meningitis was defined by a CSF culture positive for bacteria or fungi.Transmission of Cytomegalovirus to Preterm Infants Through Breast MilkZ Horvath, E Polonkai, T Kovacs, N Katona, B Kovacs-Paszthy, J Kovacs, G BallaDepartment of Obstetrics, Division of Neonatology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, HungaryBackground and AimsBreastfeeding and breast milk has many known advantages, both to newborns and to mothers. However, breast milk can also be the source of infections transmitted from mothers to newborns, and CMV transmission is probably the most common one. Premature infants who acquire postnatal CMV infection may develop a sepsis-like syndrome characterized by respiratory distress, jaundice, hepato-splenomegaly, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphocytosis. The aim of our study was to estimate the significance of the postnatal CMV infection in preterm infants.MethodsIn order to estimate the rate of severe CMV infection the records of 413 preterm infants with birth weight under 1500 g were reviewed retrospectively. Own breast milk was universally administered from the first day of life.Impact of Maternal Chorioamnionitis on Outcomes in 28–32 Weeks Gestation InfantsS Bhargava, M KhashuBC Children's Hospital and University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, CanadaBackground and AimsHistological chorioamnionitis has been associated with preterm birth, major perinatal morbidity and neonatal death. We investigated whether clinical diagnosis of chorioamnionitis in a preterm cohort would impact on need for resuscitation, neonatal mortality and infant mortality.MethodsThis is a retrospective analysis of data from the BC Perinatal Database Registry and Perinatal Reporting Tool of the BC Reproductive Care Program. We compared need for resuscitation at delivery, neonatal and infant mortality among 28–32 weeks gestation infants born between 1st April 1999 and 31st March 2002, with and without a clinical diagnosis of maternal chorioamnionitis. Statistical analysis was performed with chi-square test. Resuscitation was defined as use of IPPV by mask or ETT, chest compression, or drugs for resuscitation.Effect of Maternal Steroid on Antimicrobial Peptides Activities in Amniotic FluidH Yoshio1, M Yamada2, M Yoshida2, A Takeuchi1, K Ogura1, S Endo1, M Kageyama1, Y Yokoi1, Y Yamauchi1, B Agerberth31Department of Neonatalogy, Okayama Medical Center, Okayama, Japan, 2Department of Virology, Okayama Medical School, Okayama, Japan, 3Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsAntimicrobial peptides are present in amniotic fluid and their activities increase with perinatal infection. Our aim is to examine whether the maternal steroid treatment affects the antimicrobial peptides activities in amniotic fluid.MethodsAmniotic fluids from eleven infants were examined. Five of all were with maternal steroid and six without steroid. The gestational ages and birth weights of the former and later groups were 30 ± 1.8w and 1063 ± 391g, 33 ± 2.5w and 1658 ± 625g, respectively. Maternal betamethazone (12mg) treatments were intramuscularly carried out twice before birth. The collected amniotic fluid was adjusted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). For enrichment of proteins/peptides these solutions were passed through OASIS columns at 4 C and eluted peptides/proteins were lyophilized. These samples were analyzed for antimicrobial activity against Bacillus megaterium (strain Bm11), using an inhibition zone assay. Lysozyme activity also was examined with Micrococcus luteus cell walls. LL-37 was measured with ELISA.Mother to Child Transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in Parma: a Retrospective StudyC Ruspaggiari1, P L Bacchini1, E Romanini1, I Dodi2, G C Izzi2, G Bevilacqua11Department of Gynaecology, Obstetrics and Neonatology, University Hospital, Parma, Italy 2Infective Disease Section of Pediatrics and Oncoematology, University Hospital, Parma, ItalyBackground and AimsWe carried out a retrospective study on the decreasing rate of vertically transmitted (mother to child) HIV infection, after following a specific protocol.MethodsSince the year 1997 the protocol consists in: administering Zidovudin (following the ACTG076 protocol) to both the pregnant woman and the newborn, programmed cesarean delivery at the 38^week of pregnancy and prohibiting breast feeding. A series of controls were carried out in all newborns from the moment of birth till the age of 12 months.Caspofungin Therapy of Very Low Birth Weight Infants with Persistent Invasive CandidiasisG Dimitriou1, S Tzifas1, A Mermiga1, I Giannakopoulos1, V Pavlou1, A Darzentas1, M Marangos2, M Christofidou3, S Mantagos11Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Paediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, Greece, 2Department of Infectious Diseases, School of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, Greece, 3Department of Microbiology, School of Medicine, University of Patras, Patras, GreeceBackground and AimsInvasive candidiasis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants in neonatal intensive care units. Occasionally, despite administration of amphotericin B invasive candidiasis is complicated by persistent fungemia. Caspofungin is a novel antifungal agent. The experience of caspofungin use is very limited in neonates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of caspofungin in VLBW (&lt;1500 gr) infants with persistent candidemia.MethodsRetrospective analysis of the blood cultures in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit of University of Patras was performed.Alternative Approach to the Infection Control in Maternity Nurseries: Application of Specific Bacteriophages for Prevention and Therapy of Bacterial Infections in NeonatesM Mshvildadze1,2, S Tsertsvadze1, M Tediashvili1,3, I Davitaia1,21Association of Neonatologists of Georgia, Tbilisi, Georgia, 2Chachava Research Institute for Perinatal Medicine, Obstetrics and Gynecology, Tbilisi, Georgia 3George Eliava Institute of Bacteriophage, Microbiology and Virology, Tbilisi, GeorgiaBackground and AimsNeonatal bacterial infections result in considerable morbidity and mortality. Antibiotics still remain major treatments. Occurrence of resistant bacterial strains increases every year. Bacteriophages and antibacterial substances of plant origin may be considered as alternative medicine. To examine the epidemiology of neonatal microflora and study sensitivity of separated strains on antibiotics, bacteriophages and Tea antibacterials.MethodsSpecimens were collected at Neonatology Departments of Maternity Hospitals in Tbilisi during 10 months. Smears were collected from Women's vagina before labor, from the neonates’ oral cavity and nose immediately after birth and within 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours. Processing of specimens was performed by standard bacteriological methods. In some cases identification was made by API-tests. Sensitivity of the isolated strains to antibiotics was studied by disc diffusion method and phage sensitivity — by spot test followed by titration using double layer method.Retinopathy of PrematurityC C Loureiro, L WincklerPediatric Service, Hospital de Santo André, Leiria, PortugalBackground and AimsRetinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a vasoproliferative retinopathy that might affect premature children and, in its most severe form, result in the detachment of the retina and blindness. Our aim was to characterize the children admitted in our intermediate care unit (UCEP) with criteria to be submitted to ROP screen, and the ophthalmologic evaluation and orientation they were submitted to.MethodsDescriptive retrospective study involving children born (in-born/out-born) with gestational age (GA) ≤30 week's and/or with BW≤1500g between July/1999–June/2005, admitted at UCEP. The results were obtained by means of consultation of the individual child hospital process.Predictors and Empiric Anti-Microbial Therapy of Late-Onset Sepsis in the Neonatal Intensive Care UnitT Smolkin1, I R Makhoul1, R Hanna-Elias1, I Kassis2, A Tamir3, P Sujov11Department of Neonatology, Meyer Children's Hospital, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel 2Pediatric Infectious Diseases Unit, Meyer Children's Hospital, Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel 3Department of Epidemiology, Rappaport Faculty of Medicine, Technion, Haifa, IsraelBackground and AimsWhenever late-onset sepsis (LOS) is suspected, empiric anti-microbial therapy (AMT) is initiated after sepsis work up. To evaluate the clinical, interventional and laboratory predictors of LOS, and the appropriateness of empiric AMT in neonatal LOS.MethodsMedical records of all neonates admitted to a tertiary NICU during a 1-year period were reviewed. Of 352 neonates, 84 developed 96 suspected septic events beyond 3 days of age. LOS definition: clinical signs of sepsis + positive blood and/or urine and/or CSF culture. Clinical and laboratory abnormalities at onset of sepsis, AMT instituted, and microbiological data were recorded.Survey of Analgesia and Anaesthesia for Retinopathy of PrematurityD Anand1, B Etuwewe1, D Clark2, C W Yoxall11Neonatal Unit, Liverpool Women's NHS Foundation Trust, 2Aintree Hospital NHS Trust, Liverpool, UKBackground and AimsIn UK, there are nationally agreed guidelines for screening for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), treatment thresholds and the maximum interval between the identification of threshold disease and treatment. There are no guidelines for analgaesia or anaesthesia for the baby during treatment and we are aware of differences in clinical practise across UK. The present survey was conducted across UK regional neonatal units (NNU) to evaluate the management of babies during ROP treatment and to assess associated problems.MethodsA questionnaire on anaesthesia for ROP treatment was sent to 21 regional NNU in UK.Role pf Insulin Growth Factor and Central Retinal Artery Doppler in the Retinopathy of PrematurityA Perez-Muñuzuri1, J R Fernandez-Lorenzo1, M I Martinez-Soto1, M J Blanco-Teijeiro2, J M Fraga-Bermudez11Servicio de Neonatologia, 2Servicio de Oftalmologia, Hospital Clinico Universitario, Santiago, SpainBackground and AimsThe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is the first cause of blindness in the infant population. Many factors have been legated to the pathogenesis of this illness.MethodsA prospective study with premature babies of less than 32 weeks and / or less than 1500 grs was designed. We have determined every week since the delivery till 39 weeks of corrected gestational age the seric levels of insulin growth factor type 1 (IGF1) and the echo-doppler of the central retinal artery. An ophthalmologic exam was made to check if ROP was present.Rop Screening Criteria Need to be Adapted to the Local Population — Romanian ExperienceT Ciomartan1, C Nascutzy2, I Vǎtavu2, D Stoenescu2, I Anca1, S Stoicescu3, M Ceauşu4, A Culcer5, G Sardescu61PICU, 2Dept of Ophthalmology, 3Neonatology Unit, Institute for Mother and Child Care ‘Polizu’, 4Neonatology Unit, Clinical Hospital “I.

However, few data on antioxidant ability have been noted. Our aims are to evaluate the effects of therapy and delivery modes to erythrocyte antioxyenzymes activity of preterm infants.MethodsProspective study was performed from June 2001 to May 2002. Preterm infants with gestational age 25 to 30 weeks were included in this study. Blood was taken from umbilical arterial line or radial artery within the first 24 hours. Erythrocytes were collected by centrifugation and washed with cold saline. Erythrocyte antioxyenzymes (SOD, catalase, cellular glutathione peroxidase) activity were measured by Bioxytech SOD-525, Catalase-520, and GPx-340 and corrected by the hemoglobin level. Antenatal steroid therapy, mode of delivery, cumulative oxygen administration, and patient's data were collected from chart review. Student t test and ANOVA were used to evaluate groups of data.Impact of Delivery Type in the Hydroperoxide Membrane Levels and Erythrocytary Catalase Activity in Prematures During the Early Neonatal PeriodF Contreras-Chova1, A Bonillo-Perales3, A Molina-Carballo1, J Ochoa-Herrera2, R Pérez-Iáñez1, E Narbona-López1, M González-Ripoll3, J Uberos-Fernández1, E De Araujo-Nepomuceno2, A Muñoz-Hoyos11Departamento Pediatría, Hospital Clínico San Cecilio, 2Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de los Alimentos, Granada, 3Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Torrecárdenas, Almería, SpainBackground and AimsTo analyze the repercussion that delivery type (spontaneous vaginal vs Cesarean section) could have on oxidative stress levels, quantified by hydroperoxide concentration in erythrocyte membranes, as well as in the antioxidant catalase activity in preterm newborns (PTN), in the first week of life.Methods84 PTN with gestational ages between 26–36 weeks, and birth weight between 630–2500 g. Samples were obtained from umbilical cord and at 3 h, 72 h and 7 days of life, measuring hydroperoxide membrane levels (H2O2, ng/ml), as well as the catalase erythrocyte activity. The preterms were subdivided in two groups: Group A, 27 neonates born by spontaneous vaginal delivery and Group B, 57 newborn delivered by Cesarean section. Statistical analysis: t Student test.Evolution of Membrane Erythrocyte Hydroperoxides Levels in Neonatal Period: Comparative Analysis Between Term and Preterm NewbornsF Contreras-Chova1, J Ochoa-Herrera2, R Pérez-Iáñez1, A Molina-Carballo1, A Muñoz-Hoyos1, E Narbona-López1, J Uberos-Fernández1, E De Araujo-Nepomuceno2, M González-Ripoll3, A Bonillo-Perales31Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Universitario San Cecilio, 2Instituto de Nutrición y Tecnología de Alimentos, Granada, 3Departamento de Pediatría, Hospital Torrecárdenas, Almería, SpainBackground and AimsThe knowledge about the oxidative stress levels in newborn babies of very low weight (&lt;1500 g at birth) and his evolution in the first days is still very scarce, for what we realize a comparative study of the levels of membrane erythrocyte hydroperoxides in newborns at term and preterm, analyzing his evolution in the first week of life.Methods147 newborns subdivided in three groups: Control (CG): 63 newborn at term of weight adequate to gestational age; group A (GA), 57 very-low-birth-weight preterms (&lt;1500 g; VLBW); group B (BG): 27 preterm of 1500–2500 g.

It is likely that intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is also connected with the attack of free radicals. We presumed that IUGR is a consequence of a foetomaternal blood flow disorder. Red blood cells (RBCs) have specific properties, which enable them to reach all tissues. The membrane structure is developed to result in a special shape and elasticity. If the integrity of the membrane is damaged, RBCs lose this shape and elasticity and may undergo haemolysis. Consequently, the tissues obtain less oxygen and nutriment. Our study deals with lipid peroxidation (LP) and rheological properties of the RBC membranes.Methods156 full-term mature neonates of either sex, born between weeks 37 and 40 were included, 127 of them with normal weight (3425 ± 450g) and 29 neonates with IUGR (2125 ± 305g). We determined the erythrocyte ghost damage, the LP and filtration speed of the RBCs.Comparison of a New Transcutaneous Bilirubinometer (Bilimed) with Serum Bilirubin Measurements in Preterm and Full-Term InfantsT Karen1,2, H U Bucher1, J C Fauchère11Clinic of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 2Department of Neonatology, University Children's Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, GermanyBackground and AimsThe gold standard to asses hyperbilirubinaemia in neonates remains the serum bilirubin measurement. Unfortunately, this is invasive, painful, and costly. Bilimed®, a new transcutaneous bilirubinometer, suggests more accuracy compare to the existing non-invasive bilirubinometers because of its new technology, it includes different ethnic skin colors, does not need contact with the skin during measurement, and generates no additional costs per measurement. Aim was to assess the agreement between this new transcutaneous bilirubinometer and serum bilirubin.MethodsThe Bilimed® preterm and term infants, including different ethnic colors of skin. Serum bilirubin concentration was determined simultaneously. The agreement between both methods was assessed by the method of Bland-Altman.Neonatal Readmission for Primary HyperbilirubinemiaM Kaplan1,2, R Bromiker1,3, M S Schimmel1,3, C Hammerman1,31Department of Neonatology, Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, 2Hebrew University, Jerusalem, 3Ben Gurion University of The Negev, Be'er Sheva, IsraelBackground and AimsIn the absence of a measure for assessing the incidence or severity of post-discharge bilirubin morbidity, surveillance of the rate of hospital readmission has been suggested to assess this potential.MethodsThe rate of readmission for neonatal hyperbilirubinemia was determined in term and near-term neonates cared for in the well baby nurseries of the Shaare Zedek Medical Center. Severity of hyperbilirubinemia and etiological categories were compared between those who required phototherapy either during birth hospitalization or readmission.Unrecognized Mild Alterations in the Metabolism of Bilirubin May Underlie Significant HyperbilirubinemiaS Fernández Ureña1, A Barrio Merino2, F Cava3, A Martín-Ancel41Neonatology Unit, Agrupación Sanitaria Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain 2Pediatrics Unit, Fundación Hospital Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain, 3Laboratory Unit, Fundación Hospital Alcorcón, Madrid, Spain, 4Neonatology Unit, Agrupación Sanitaria Hospital Sant Joan de Deu, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, SpainBackground and AimsA salient feature of recent guidelines for the management of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is the assessment of risk for severe hyperbilirubinemia in part by means of evaluation of clinical risk factors. However, clinical risk factors are not apparent in many cases with severe hyperbilirubinemia. Objective: To analyze the incidence, etiology, treatment, and outcome of term and near-term newborns (GA≥35) with bilirubin levels ≥20 mg/dl.MethodsNewborns were identified using computer databases from a cohort of 14,129 infants (1998–2005). Data on clinical manifestations, etiology, treatment, and follow-up were obtained.Validating a Computer Tool Which Helps to Use the AAP Guideline on HyperbilirubinemiaA Balaguer, M Camprubí, M Milá, R Collell, R Jimenez-Feijoo, F Pagone, J EscribanoUnitat de Neonatología Hospital Sant Joan de Reus, Reus, SpainBackground and AimsThe AAP guidelines for evaluating the risk of severe hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn changed in 2004. The clinical decision to initiate treatment with phototherapy or exchange transfusion is subject to many errors. Objectives Aware of this problem, we designed a spreadsheet (NeoBili), which helps to interpret bilirubin levels according to the infant's age in hours and helps to take into account the clinical risk factors.MethodsA randomised controlled trial was conducted with simulated clinical cases. In this preliminary study, one hundred and eighty simulated cases were performed by two groups, one of paediatricians and another of paediatric residents. The main variables measured were the number of errors (“minor” and “major”) and the time taken to make the decision.Correlation of Gender and Mode of Delivery with Neonatal JaundiceG Z Zantopoulos, O Gkika, S Liosi, P Anastasopoloulou, A Giannisi, N Manakou, C Rossas, I Anastasopoulos, Z PatronaDepartment of Paediatric, General Hospital of Korinthos, Korinthos, GreeceBackground and AimsNeonatal jaundice (NJ) is a common condition and usually a benign transitional event that resolves without treatment. The aim of this study was to determine the correlation of gender and mode of delivery with the values of bilirubin in healthy full- term neonates.MethodsSerum total bilirubin (TSB) measurements were initially made at the 24th hour of life and repeated daily for the next 4 days) in 198 full-term healthy breast feeding newborns born in a regional hospital and correlated with gender and mode of delivery. (n=198, males=104- females=94, median Birth Weight = 3230 g).The Impact of Bacteriemia on Jaundice Which Required Exchange Transfusion in NeonatesN Tekin, A AksitDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Eskisehir Osmangazi University Medical Faculty, Eskisehir, TurkeyBackground and AimsIn recent years the need for exchange transfusion in neonatal jaundice was decreased with improvement in perinatal care in Turkey. Rh incompatibility cases reduced while the cases with unknown etiology increased. This study was designed to evaluate the incidence of bacteriemia in the infants who received exchange transfusion in the last two years.MethodsThis study was performed in Osmangazi University Medical Faculty Hospital which is a tertiary level perinatal center. We reviewed the charts of the infants with a gestational age &gt;/= 36 weeks who received exchange transfusion for indirect hyperbilirubinemia. Sixty one infants were found suitable for evaluation from January 2004 to November 2005. Mean gestational age was 39.1±1.31 weeks, and birth weight was 3187.5±573.63 grams.

Mayo, Ireland, 4The Conway Institute School of Medicine and Medical Sciences, University College, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsWalker-Warburg syndrome is characterised by congenital muscular dystrophy in conjunction with severe brain malformations and ocular abnormalities. Also known as HARD +/− E syndrome hydrocephalous (H). Agyria (A), retinal dysplasia (RD) with or without encephaloceole (+/−E) the condition is usually lethal within the first few months of life. This extremely rare autosomal recessive congenital muscular dystrophy is one of more than 35 genetic conditions now known to occur in the highly consanguineous Irish Traveller Population.MethodsWe report a family (including a detailed family pedigree) from the Irish Traveller Community who have 2 infants diagnosed with the dystroglycanopathy; 4 of mother's siblings were also affected.Hepatic Neonatal HemangioendotheliomaM García Peris1, M Aguar Carrascosa1, I Izquierdo Macián1, E Pérez Santolaya1, J J Vila Carbó2, F Morcillo Sopena11Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Pediatric Hospital La Fe, Valencia, Italy, 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Pediatric Hospital La Fe, Valencia, ItalyBackground and AimsHepatic tumors in children are uncommon (2–3% of pediatric tumors). However, infantile hemangioendothelioma is the most frequent benign vascular liver tumor in infancy. Although they are usually benign tumors, they may be life-threatening if haemodynamic or hematologic complications are associated.MethodsCase report.Audit of Trisomy 13 and 18 Cases Over a Ten Year Period in IrelandN Ni Shuibhne, R Howell, A J Green, S A LynchThe National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsIn Western Europe the majority of cases of trisomy 13 and 18 are detected antenatally through routine anomaly ultrasound screening. Routine screening is not uniform in Ireland and antenatal detection is much lower.MethodsWe performed an audit of cases of trisomy 13 and 18 made by our Cytogenetics department from 1995–2005.Immature Sucking Patterns in Infants of Diabetic MothersR Bromiker1, A Rachamim2, C Hammerman1, M Schimmel1, M Kaplan1, B Medoff-Cooper31Department of Neonatology, Shaareh Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel, 2School of Medicine, Hadassah Hebrew University, Jerusalem, Israel 3School of Nursing, University of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania, PA, USABackground and AimsInfants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) frequently feed less well than normal counterparts. Our goal was to evaluate sucking patterns in IDMs to objectively demonstrate any difference in these patterns.MethodsTerm healthy IDMs whose mothers were managed with either insulin or diet alone (insulin and diet groups respectively) were compared to matched normal infants (control group). Sucking parameters were recorded over 5 minutes’ bottle feedings with the Kron's Apparatus on the third day of life. Student's t-test was used to compare continuous variables and X2 test for categorical variables.Nutrient Deficits in Vlbw Infants: Current Nutrition Practice Is Not Good EnoughS K Somisetty, M Khashu, M Paterson, L Hawkes, A Urs, M VaithianathanNeonatal Unit, Leicester Royal Infirmary, University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, Leicester, UKBackground and AimsUnder nutrition and extra uterine growth restriction is a major problem in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants. We evaluated daily nutrient intake in VLBW infants during first four weeks of life and compared with the recommended dietary intake (RDI) to quantify nutrient deficits accrued in the neonatal period.MethodsDaily nutrient intakes were analysed in VLBW infants (birth weight ≤ 1250g) admitted to our NICU between 01/01/05 and 31/12/05. Neonates with major congenital malformations and abdominal surgical problems were excluded. Actual intake of calories and protein (both enteral and parenteral) was subtracted from RDI (120Kcal/kg/day, 3.8 g of protein/kg/day) and nutritional deficits calculated. Data are expressed as mean ± standard deviation.Plasma Concentrations of Arginine and Asymmetric Dimethylarginine in Premature Infants: A Possible Explanation of Necrotizing EnterocolitisR M van Elburg1, M Richir2, M P C Siroen2, W P F Fetter1, F Quik1, R J Nijveldt2, B J Smit4, T Teerlink3, P A M van Leeuwen21Department of Pediatrics Subdivision of Neonatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Surgery, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 3Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands 4Department of Neonatology, Emma Children's Hospital Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsSeveral studies have described reduced plasma concentrations of arginine, the substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in infants with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). It is currently not known what the level of the plasma concentrations of the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is in patients with NEC. We investigated whether plasma concentrations of arginine, ADMA and their ratio differ between premature infants with and without NEC, and within the NEC group between survivors and non-survivors.MethodsIn a prospective case-control study, arginine, and ADMA concentrations were measured in 10 premature infants with NEC (mean (SD) gestational age 197 (15) days, birthweight 1089 (367) g), and 10 matched control infants (gestational age 201 (14) days, birthweight 1063 (209) g), admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.Population Based Epidemiology Of Necrotizing Enterocolitis On Very Low Birth Weight Infants In Portugal, 1996–2004D Virella1, G Rocha2, G Silva2, H Guimarães2, R N Muito Baixo Peso31UCIN, Hospital de Dona Estefânia, Lisboa, Portugal 2Serviço se Neonatologia, Hospital de São João, Porto, Portugal, 3Secção de Neonatologia da Sociedade Portuguesa de Pediatria, Lisboa, PortugalBackground and AimsNecrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) is a worrisome acquired gastrointestinal disease in VLBWI. We aim to monitor the population epidemiology and clinical outcomes of NEC in VLBWI.MethodsThe National Registry of VLBWI Database (1996–2004) was used for NEC-related morbidity and mortality risk analysis. Bell's stage II–III cases were considered.Effects of Oral Stimulation and Support on Sucking Performance of Preterm InfantA Chemin1, L Da Nobrega2, A Henrot1, M Boiron2, E Saliba1,31NICU, Clocheville Hospital, Tours, France 2Laboratory of Physiology and Digestive Motility, Faculty of Medicine, Tours, France, 3INSERM U 619, François Rabelais University, Tours, FranceBackground and AimsThe preterm infant frequently experiences oral feeding difficulties, because of brain stem immaturity and oral disorders due to inadequate oral stimulations in neonatal period (poor and painful stimuli). Oral stimulations before feeding or oral support measures seem to enhance suck and swallow coordination of the preterm infant. The aim of our study was to assess the beneficial effects of oral stimulation and support on preterm sucking performance.Methods51 preterm infants born before 34 weeks gestationnel age were randomised into 3 experimental groups according to oral stimulation program and oral support measures, realised independently or combined, and control group. The oral stimulation program was administered once per day for 14 consecutive days, before tube enteral feeding then the bottle feeding was introduced. Oral support was administered once per day, during transition from tube to independent oral feeding. Suction's strength (exprimed in mmHg) and frequency (measured in percentage of all sucking burst length during the entire recording) were regularly evaluated by a pressure transducer.Diaphragmatic Endurance Following Abdominal Defect Repair in Gastroschisis InfantsG Dimitriou, C Agakidis, G F Rafferty, A GreenoughDivision of Asthma, Allergy and Lung Biology, Guy's, King's and St Thomas’ Medical School, London, UKBackground and AimsIt has been shown that diaphragmatic strength postoperatively is impaired in infants with gastroschisis. Diaphragmatic tension-time index (TTdi), which describes the pressure-generating activity of the diaphragm, is a measure of diaphragmatic endurance and hence a high TTdi can predict diaphragmatic fatigue. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that infants who had surgical repair of gastroschisis would have impaired diaphragmatic endurance.MethodsTwenty gastroschisis and twenty control infants, median gestational age 37 weeks were studied. TTdi was assessed in gastroschisis infants and controls matched to gestational age. TTdi was calculated as the product of the mean to the maximum transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdimean/Pdimax) and the inspiratory duty cycle (Ti/Ttot). Transdiaphragmatic pressure (Pdi) was calculated by subtraction of oesophageal from gastric pressure measured using a Gaeltec dual pressure catheter during quiet breathing. The Pdimean during a breath was electronically determined over the inspiratory time interval where the Pdimax was the largest transdiaphragmatic pressure generated during airway occlusions performed at the end of a crying effort. The inspiratory duty cycle was calculated using the oesophageal and transdiaphragmatic pressure signals.Effects of Oral Glutamine Supplementation on the Intestinal Permeability and Growth of Preterm InfantsS Sevastiadou, A Puchner-Malamitsi, E Stratiki, L Kastanidou, M Skouroliakou, A Antsaklis, C KostalosDepartment of Neonatology, ‘Alexandra’ University Hospital, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsThe aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Glutamine supplementation on the intestinal permeability of preterm infants and contribution to growth.MethodsIn a prospective randomized study, 74 healthy premature neonates of less than 2000gr. birth weight, born at gestational age of 26 – 34 weeks, were included. Fourty one neonates (Glutamine group) received a preterm formula, supplemented with Glutamine 0,3gr. per kg, whereas the other thirty four neonates were fed with non supplemented formula (control group). Lactulose/mannitol excretion ratio in urine samples was used to measure the intestinal permeability and was performed three times: a) at birth b) at the age of 7days c) at the age of 1-month.Emergency Drainage of Abdominal Compartment Syndrome in Severe Necrotising Enterocolitis Improves Cardiac Output and Respiratory FunctionJ Brierley1, N Hall2, A Pierro2, M Peters11Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care, 2Department of Paediatric Surgery, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsAbdominal distension in severe necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) may cause an abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). In other scenarios (e.g. abdominal trauma) multi-organ failure (MOF) is accelerated by a reduction in venous return and increased systemic vascular resistance secondary to the ACS. While semi-elective abdominal drainage is a recognised approach to perforated NEC, the acute haemodynamic impact of emergency abdominal drainage (EAD) has not been reported. We hypothesised that ACS can be a contributor to the MOF of NEC and that EAD improves cardiorespiratory function immediately in these most severely ill premature infants.MethodsSix infants (corrected gestation 25–33 weeks, weight 0.77–2.2Kg) with stage III NEC, and profound cardiorespiratory failure (despite volume resuscitation &gt; 60ml/kg, epinephrine &gt; 0.5 mcg/kg/min) on admission had clinical ACS and underwent EAD. Cardiac Index (cardiac output/body surface area) was assessed with the non-invasive USCOM device immediately prior to and within 6 min of drainage. Oxygenation index (OI =FiO2xMean Airway Pressure/PaO2) was noted before and &lt;60 min after drainage.Effects of Oral Bifidobacterium Lactis on the Intestinal Permeability and the Growth of Preterm InfantsE Stratiki1, S Sevastiadou1, K Stamouli1, O Kastanidou2, M Skouroliakou2, C Kostalos11Department of Neonatology, General Hospital ‘Alexandra’, 2Department of Science of Nutrition and Dietetics, Harakopio University, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsThe aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of Bifidobacterium lactis supplementation on the intestinal permeability of preterm infants and its contribution to growth.MethodsIn a prospective randomized study, 75 healthy premature neonates of less than 2000 gr. birth weight, born at gestational age of 26–36 weeks, were included. Forty-one neonates (probiotic group) received a preterm formula to which B.lactis was added, whereas the other thirty-four neonates were fed with an un-supplemented pre-term formula (control group). The intestinal permeability was examined three times using a sugar permeability absorption test, by introducing orally mannitol and lactulose and assessing their concentration in urine samples: a) at birth b) seven days after the initiation of feeding and, c) at the age of 1 month or 21– 25 days after the onset of enteral feeding.Neonatal Dehydration — Why Increasing Incidence?M Reilev, O Pryds, K BørchDepartment of Childcare, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidovre, DenmarkBackground and AimsNeonatal dehydration with hypernatraemia is a serious condition with risk of cerebral damage and death. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of dehydration among readmitted neonates and to determine related complications.MethodsA retrospective study was conducted at Hvidovre Hospital over a 5-year period to identify term or near-term infants (&gt;35 weeks of gestation) who were admitted with a weight loss &gt;10%. Infants admitted between the third and the 14th day of life having a discharge diagnosis code indicating dehydration were included.Intestinal Protection By Activation Of Ppar GammaC Kluthe, K Klinghammer, R Wauer, F GuthmannDepartment of Neonatology, Charité Campus Mitte, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsPrematurity remains the main but less understood risk factor for necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) — the most devastating intestinal emergency in premature infants. The molecular mechanisms of immaturity are still unclear, nutrition with breast milk is known to act prophylactic. We aimed to specify prophylactic peptides, which are developmentally expressed, and induced by activation of transcriptional factor PPARg.MethodsIntestinal expression of haeme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and treefoil factor 3 (TFF3) was measured by quantitative PCR and western blot analysis in rats before (d18, d20 post conceptionem), and after birth (d2 p.n.) comparing the effects of PPARg activation (oral application of Pioglitazone to the mother). Early enterocolitis was induced in dam-fed newborn rats by hypercapnia/reoxygenation (H/R) in Pioglitazone treated animals. Capase 3 activation was detected calorimetically.Serum and Breast Milk Leptin and Ghrelin Levels in Breast and Formula FED NewbornsE Onal1, N Okumus1, C Turkyilmaz1, Y Atalay1, S Elbeg2, H Pasaoglu21Department of Pediatrics, Gazi University Medical School, Ankara, Turkey, 2Department of Clinical Biochemistry, Gazi Uinversity Medical School, Ankara, TurkeyBackground and AimsThe aim of this study was to investigate serum and breast milk leptin, ghrelin, insulin, GH ve IGF concentrations before and after feeding in exclusively breastfed and formula fed neonates.MethodsThe serum and breast milk leptin, ghrelin, insulin, GH ve IGF concentrations were measured before (fasting) and 30 minutes after feeding (postprandial) in 22 breastfed and 23 formula fed term infants at Gazi University Hospital. The study was approved by local ethical committee.A Study of Epidermal Growth Factor in Saliva of Normal Preterm Infants — Implications for Management of NEC?A Gupta1, K Lakhoo2, N Pritchard11Neonatal Unit, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK 2Department of Paediatric Surgery, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UKBackground and AimsEpidermal growth factor (EGF) is an amino acid polypeptide that has been shown to promote mucosal healing and intestinal growth in experimental models and has a potential role in the aetiology and treatment of NEC. We have previously shown that EGF measurement in saliva was relatively consistent and reproducible as compared to other bodily fluids. The aim of this study was to determine the normal levels of salivary EGF in a cohort of pre-term infants.MethodsWith appropriate ethical approval and informed consent, saliva was collected using a suction catheter from all normal pre-term infants admitted to our unit over a 9 month period. The samples were immediately frozen at −20 C and analysed using an ELISA assay. All results are expressed as mean values with standard deviation.Improving the Nutritional Intake of the Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) InfantM C Chua1, W Y Teo2, J M Gomez1, J Y Soh31Department of Neonatology, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, 2Department of Paediatric Medicine, KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, 3Department of Paediatric Medicine, National University Hospital, SingaporeBackground and AimsTo reduce mean duration of time taken for VLBW infants (birth weight &lt; 1500 grams) to attain a weight of 2 kg, by 15% over 6 months.MethodsA multidisciplinary team involving neonatologists, nurse managers and dietitian was formed. Nutritional interventions were introduced based on evidence in the literature. New parenteral nutrition policies (early initiation of total parenteral nutrition, rapid advancement of amino-acids, lipids, glucose) and new enteral nutrition policies (standardization of definition of minimal enteral nutrition, revision of rate of feed increment, encouragement of use of breast milk, introduction of ad-lib feeding, use of preterm milk formula instead of term milk formula when breast milk was not available) were implemented using a clinical pathway in December 2004. An audit on the clinical pathway was carried out from December 2004 to May 2005.Gastrotonometric Examinations with a New, Easily Applicable Probe in Infants Requiring Intensive CareG Tálosi1, J Kaszaki2, D Boda11Department of Paediatrics, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary, 2Department of Experimental Surgery, University of Szeged, Szeged, HungaryBackground and AimsGastrotonometry, a method developed for the measurement of the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PgCO2) in the gastrointestinal tract. The main field of application is to monitor the condition of patients in critical states. Although it is widely applied in adult intensive care, its use is limited in paediatrics. Our main aim was to develop a method with which gastrotonometric examinations can be performed on neonates and infants, without difficulties.MethodsA newly developed balloon-free probe was used. 29 neonates and infants requiring intensive care were monitored (age: 2 – 456 days, weight: 1200 – 6700g). Paediatric Index of Mortality scores, PCO2 gap values, acid base parameters and intramucosal pH values were measured/calculated. Results of surviving and non-surviving patients were compared with unpaired, two-tailed Student's test.Vertical HIV Exposure — A New Risk Factor for Necrotizing Enterocolitis?T Schmitz1, K Weizsaecker2, C Feiterna-Sperling3, E Eilers1, M Obladen11Department of Neonatology, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin Charité, Berlin, Germany, 2Department of Obstetrics, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin Charité, Berlin, Germany, 3Department of Pediatric Pulmonology and Immunology, Campus Virchow Klinikum, Universitaetsmedizin Berlin Charité, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsClassical risk factors for necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) are prematurity, hypoxia/ischemia, cardiac malformation, anaemia, and formula feeding. In a recent study, an association between maternal HIV infection and NEC has been observed in preterm neonates (Desfrere et al. 2005). We report about a term infant that developed NEC without identifiable risk factors other than exposure to maternal HIV infection and to antiretroviral medication.MethodsCase report.An Unexpected Cause of Gastric Perforation in a Term NeonateP Korhonen1, M Helminen1, T Iber1, A Abram2, O Tammela11Department of Paediatrics, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland, 2Department of Paediatrics, Kanta-Häe Central Hospital, Hämeenlinna, FinlandBackground and AimsNeonatal gastric perforation is a rare occurrence of often unknown etiology.

These contractures are retracted fibres of soft tissues that have no more vitality, like, muscle fibres, fasciaes, aponeurotic fibres, muscle tendon fibres and ligaments produced by the degenerative process of dystrophy and this has a negative influence on all areas of the locomotor apparatus functions. The aim of this valuation is to demonstrate the possible optimisation of CP children with spastic forms of rehabilitation.MethodsThe Miotenofasciotomy eliminates muscle contractures of upper and lower extremities and those in the postural muscles of the body. Clinical methods for medical examination and recordings were made to 107 Spanish patients with CP who were operated using this surgery treatment. The period of time they were operated is from March 2005 until April 2006. These patients had different forms of CP like, spastic forms and mixed (spastic-hiperkinnetic and spastic-distonic forms).Pulmonary Complications in Spinal Muscular AtrophiesG Sur1,2, V Salajan1, D T Gireada1, L Sur21Clinica Pediatrie II, Cluj-Napoca, Romania 2University of Medicine, Cluj-Napooca, RomaniaBackground and AimsThe authors intend to present the pulmonary complications of various forms of muscular atrophies. These complications have been severe in type I and II of the disease and only transitory in type III. These complications have consisted of bacterial pulmonary infections that finally ended in death in the two cases with type I and II disease.MethodsThere are presented 3 cases of spinal muscular atrophy with 3 types of disease. A 1 month old infant with generalized hypotonia having the appearance of a doll. The final diagnosis is Werdnig-Hoffmann disease type 1. The second case, a 7 month old infant is brought for a severe generalized hypotonia beginning at the age of 6–7 months. Established the diagnosis: Spinal muscular atrophy type 2. The third case is seen for a severe scoliosis and in the end the diagnosis was type 3 spinal muscular atrophy.Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension in ChildrenK Chandanos, P Neonaki, M Mavrokosta, S Stefanaki, T Tsekoura, A Sxoinaki, A Tsilimigaki-ChristakiPediatric Clinic, Venizeleio General Hospital, Iraklio, Crete, GreeceBackground and AimsIdiopathic intracranial hypertension (I.I.H.) is uncommon in children. It is critical to recognize the warning signs and symptoms to prevent devastating ophthalmologic complications. Obesity has been reported as an important risk factor for I.I.H.MethodsWe report two cases of obese adolescent patients who were diagnosed with I.I.H. Case 1: A 13- year-old obese male, with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 32,8 presented with diplopia and neck pain during the last 15 days. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure was 870mmH20, with normal CSF content. Case 2: A 13- year-old obese female, with a BMI of 28 presented with headache, nausea and occasional vomiting during the last 10 days and diplopia the last 2 days. She referred use of minocyclin as treatment for acnes. CSF pressure was 420mm H20, with normal CSF content and blood pressure. In both cases neurologic examination revealed VI cranial nerve palsy, ophthalmologic examination revealed papilledema, blood chemistry was normal and brain MRI was unremarkable. Both patients started treatment with acetazolamide and were put on a low calorie diet. During the following 3 months papilledema gradually resolved and treatment was tapered while they remained symptom free.Evaluation of the Specific Dysmorphic Features in Multimalformative SyndromesE Sukarova-Angelovska, M Kocova, M Krstevska-KonstantinovaDepartment of Endocrinology and Genetics, Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsThe combination of minor and major dysmorphic malformations is unique in various multimalformative syndromes. Some of them are wellknown and easy to recognize, but in the majority of the cases evaluation of spectrum of present anomalies is time-consuming and difficult. Some of the minor dysmorphic stigmata (hypertelorism, epicantus, clinodactylia) are more frequent and present in many syndromes, thus are not informative. Appearance of specific pattern of dysmorphic features (lobulated tongue, creases of the ear lobules, iris spots) can help in syndrome delineation.MethodsEvaluation of 250 children with various congenital malformations was done. The children were divided in 4 groups and subgroups according to the etiology. Malformations and combination of malformations (both minor and major) of head, neck, extremities and organs were analyzed.Measurement of Pain Caused by Venipuncture in Children Under Three Years OldI Ledesma, R álvarez, L Regueras, C Iglesias, M Neira, M Roson, L M RodriguezServicio de Pediatria, Hospital de León, León, SpainBackground and AimsVenipuncture is the painful procedure more used in pediatrics and in that way it's seen for allied health personnel and for parents. This study measures the pain caused by venipuncture in children under three years old, judging the differences which can be attributed to sex.MethodsProspective, cross-sectional and observational study in 30 infants, with a mean age of 16,3 months, which venipuncture was carried out to performing a renal scan. Bell pain rating scale was applied in all of them, which takes into account behavioral parameters — facial expression, motor activity, body language, cry and solace and biological ones — heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP) and O2 saturation (SAT); and pain is classified in: Absence of pain, moderate pain and intense pain. Results were compared using the Mann- Whitney U, Wilcoxon and χ2 test, as appropriate.One Patient, Two Rare Diseases!S M Nunes1, H Silva1, M Marques1, A Silva1, I Cunha1, C Mota2, M S Faria2, E Pereira2, A Pereira11Department of Neonatology, Hospital de São Marcos, Braga, Portugal, 2Department of Nephrology, Hospital de Crianças Maria Pia, Porto, PortugalBackground and AimsThe presence of two genetic disorders in a single patient is uncommon.

How Necessary is it to Obtain a Urine Culture Under Treatment?D Karakaidos, G Triantafyllidis, A Salapata, A Papadimitropoulou, P Zosi, F Papadelis, C KarisDepartment of Pediatrics, General Hospital of Nikea, Piraeus, GreeceBackground and AimsObtaining a urine culture sample on the 3rd day of treatment in a child with a urinary tract infection (UTI) in order to assess response to therapy has become standard practice in pediatric departments. The aim of our study was to examine whether that practice is necessary to perform in a child who otherwise has signs of clinical improvement and is receiving the appropriate antibiotic therapy (according to the sensitivity of the isolated pathogen).MethodsWe examined the records of children with UTIs admitted to our department during a five year period (2000–2005). Urinary cultures were taken in 310 children (138 boys-172 girls, 15 days-14 yrs old) with established UTIs on the 3rd day of a treatment compatible with sensitivity of the offending pathogen to the appropriate antibiotic. 16.1% of cultures were taken as freshly voided urine, 0.6% with a suprapubic puncture, 12.9% with the use of a catheter and 70.3% using a bag.Urine Microalbumin, Alpha1- Microglobulin and Beta2- Microglobulin in Children with Hematuria without Obvious ProteinuriaD Karakaidos1, G Karagrigoriou1, G Triantafyllidis1, A Drakatos2, Z Tseflika1, E Tasiopoulou1, C Karis11Department of Pediatrics, General Hospital of Nikea, Piraeus, Greece, 2Department of Biochemistry, Children's Hospital “P&amp;A. Kyriakou”, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsIsolated significant hematuria in children can be a sign of numerous causes, benign or not. At those children an evaluation of renal function can be made with the use of urine beta2-microglobulin (b2-MG) and alpha1-microglobulin (a1-MG) which are indices of renal tubular damage and urine microalbumin (L) which is an index of renal glomerular damage. Our aim was to measure b2-MG, a1-MG and L in children with hematuria in a routine urinalysis without obvious proteinuria.MethodsFirst morning void urine samples were collected from 678 healthy children (403 boys and 275 girls) 7–12 years old and from 72 children (37 boys and 35 girls, mean age 9,9 ± 1,8yrs) with hematuria without proteinuria in urinalysis. Beta2-microglobulin, alpha1- microglobulin and microalbumin levels were measured with the nephelometry method and expressed as mg/L.Nephrolithiasis in Ectopic KidneyM Trenceva1, S Todorovska2, M Nikolovska1, S Smugreska1, K Cekic-Dimovska3, R Hadzi-Manceva4, V Tasic51Pediatric Service, Health Center Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia, 2Pediatric Office, PZU Pantelejmon, Skopje, Macedonia, 3Pediatric Office, PZU Pinokio, Skopje, Macedonia, 4Pediatric Service, Remedica Hospital, Skopje, Macedonia,5Department of Pediatric Nephrology, Children's Hospital Skopje, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsEctopic kidney is poorly visualized with ultrasound.

The most severe is the classic infantile-onset form with prominent cardiomegaly, hipotonia, and death priop to first year of life. We report an infant with the classical course of the infantile-onset Pompe disease, who died at 4,5 months of age due to pneumonia and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.MethodsThe diagnosis was based on physical examination, cardiology investigation, serum CPK assay, and autopsy study.Triplicated Collecting System, a Rare Urological MalformationS Tomé1, A Sequeira1, A Reis2, R Castro2, P Teixeira11Paediatric Service, Hospital SãoJoãode Deus, Vila Nova de Famalicão, Portugal, 2Paediatric Surgery, Hospital Maria Pia, Porto, PortugalBackground and AimsUrinary tract infections occur in 3–5% of girls and 1% of boys and have been considered an important risk factor for the development of renal insufficiency. Some anatomical abnormalities of the urinary system predispose to infection, and their correction is sometimes necessary to solve the problem. The authors report a clinical case of a rare urological malformation in a girl with multiple urinary infections.MethodsRevision of the clinical case by medical and image registrations.A Comprehensive Conservative Management for End-Stage Renal FailureA J Al MosawiDepartment of Pediatrics, University Hospital in Al Kadhimiyia, Baghdad, IraqBackground and AimsThe appropriate dietary and pharmacologic management (conservative measures) of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) includes: protein and phosphorus restriction, calorie and water soluble vitamins supplementation, phosphate binders, etc. With appropriate dietary and pharmacologic management, patients with non-terminal chronic renal failure (CRF) can be maintained surprisingly well, and the transition from non-terminal CRF to end-stage-renal failure ESRF represents a small decrement of renal function resulting in a large physiologic hurdle for the patient. Conservative measures can only be successful in non- terminal CRF, and patients with ESRF can't sustain life in the absence of renal replacement therapy. The addition to these effective traditional measures, an agent enhance fecal nitrogen excretion can possibly bridge this gap resulting from this small decrement of renal function obviating the need for RRT for some period of time. A novel regimen combining the traditional conservative management of CRF with addition of Acacia gum (AG) 1g/kg /day has been reported to provide patients with ESRF dialysis freedom. Aim: To describe the longest period of dialysis freedom (3-year) achieved in history with this novel form of RRT.MethodsAn 11-year-old girl with ESRF who initially required 4 sessions of intermittent peritoneal dialysis to control uremic symptoms despite conservative measures. Thereafter, managed with a novel regimen combining the traditional conservative management of CRF including low protein diet with addition of Acacia gum (AG) 1g/kg /day. One year dialysis and improve well- being was achieved [Published in October issue of Pediatric Nephrology 2004]. This patient continued the previously described regimen for additional two years.Early Onset End-Stage Renal Failure in Oculo-Cerebro-Renal Phenotype: Novel OccurrenceA J Al MosawiHead of the Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital, Al Kadhimiyia, Baghdad, IraqBackground and AimsThe Oculo-cerebro-renal syndrome (OCRS) is a rare disorder characterized by congenital ocular and cerebral defects, and renal tubular dysfunction with later renal onset of renal failure during the fourth. The paper reports the novel occurrence of early end-stage renal failure (ESRF) in OCRS phenotype.MethodsFrom 1994 to 2005 four patients (two boys and two girls) with OCRS phenotype were observed. All of them have congenital cataract(s), hypotonia and hyporeflexia and renal dysfunction.Unilateral Renal Agenesis Associated with 76th Case of Coffin-Siris Syndrome in the WorldA J Al MosawiHead of Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Al Kadhimiyia, Baghdad, IraqBackground and AimsCoffin Siris syndrome (CSS) is a rare clinical syndrome of unknown etiology, first described by Coffin GS and Siris E in 3 unrelated girls with mental retardation and absent nails and terminal phalanx of the fifth finger in 1970. Until now only 75 cases have been reported. Renal agenesis has been reported infrequently in CSS.MethodsPatient: A 4 years old dysmorphic and mentally retarded girl. She was born at 30 weeks of gestation by cesarean delivery because of lack of progress of labour. Her weight was 1.75 kg. During infancy feeding difficulties was prominent. Her development was retarded with no language development, gross motor milestones was slightly better than other fields of development. She didn't have any urinary complaint. Her growth was retarded with all of her parameters below the third centiles. She has coarse facial features with thick eyebrows, mild left ptosis big mouth, thick prominent lips facial hypertrichosis and low nuchal hair line. Her hands showed single palmer creases, fingers and nails were small; the terminal phalanges of her fingers were small with hypoplastic changes more severe on the little finger of the right hand.Assessment of Fever, Wbc, Esr and Crp in the First Urinary Tract Infection in ChildrenA NickavarDepartment of Pediatrics, Hazrat Rassoul Hospital, Tehran, IranBackground and AimsUrinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common infections in children, which in the form of acute pyelonephritis with delayed and improper treatment leads to kidney scarring, hypertention and renal failure. The present study was done for the evaluation of important differentiating parameters in pyelonephritis and cystitis.MethodsThis cross sectional study was performed in 96 patients with the first attack of UTI during 3 years.

Kyriakou”, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsIt is well established that, for both children and adults, elevated values of urine beta2- microglobulin (b2-MG) and alpha1-microglobulin (a1- MG) are indices of renal tubular damage and elevated urine microalbumin (L) is an index of renal glomerular damage. Measurement of these indices at first morning void urine samples is corresponding quite accurately with the 24 hour urine sample and is much more convenient to obtain in children. Our aim was to evaluate the normal range of L, b2-MG and a1-MG in healthy children using first morning void urine samples.MethodsFirst morning void urine samples were collected from 678 healthy children (384 boys and 294 girls) 7–12 years old. Children with a history of urinary tract infections or other renal disease, with febrile disease the last 15 days, abnormal findings in urinalysis or drug treatment of any kind were excluded from our study. Beta2-microglobulin, alpha1-microglobulin and microalbumin were measured with the nephelometry method.Congenital Hydronephrosis Presenting as Acute PyonephrosN Ristoska Bojkovska, D Kuzmanovska, V Tasic, E SahpazovaDepartment of Nephrology, Children's Hospital, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsCongenital urinary tract anomalies are often in children. We present a case of late detected urinary tract malformation. We investigated a 12 years boy with fever and urinary tract infection. The ultrasound examination showed ureterohydronephrosis on the left side and one 4×3 cm cystic formation. Acute pyelonephritis was severe with abdominal and lumbal pain, high temperature and laboratory findings for developing urosepsis.MethodsCT abdomen showed hydronephrotic left kidney with reduction of the parenchyma and pyonephros. Radionuclide renal scanning (DMSA) was pathological with a functional left kidney. Conventional radio-opaque voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) confirmed the diagnosis of stenosis prevesicalis with ureterohydronephrosis of the left side.Pulmonary Expression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (Vegf) in Newborn Rats Exposed to Hypoxia and Recovered in Hyperoxia or AirA Remesal1, C Pedraz1, D Ludeña2, L San Feliciano1, M J Hernández11Neonatal Unit, Department of Pediatrics, 2Department of Cellular Biology and Pathology, Salamanca University, Salamanca, SpainBackground and AimsVEGF is a potent endothelial cell growth factor expressed in normal lung tissue. This study was performed to investigate the expression of VEGF in development rat lung under basal conditions and after hypoxia and oxidative stress.MethodsWe evaluated pulmonary VEGF expression in rats at 0 and 14 days of life. At 4–8 hours of life newborn rats were exposed in sequential way during 2 hours in hypoxia, and recovered in &gt;95% oxygen or 21% oxygen; the control group were exposed in 21% oxygen. For VEGF inmunostaining, the lungs were fixed by intratracheal instillation 4% paraformaldehyde and paraffin embedded for tissue sections. Inmunohistochemistry was performed on lung tissue sections by using 1:100 dilution of rabbit anti-human VEGF. We used a semiquantitative assessment of VEGF inmunostained, were assigned a relative value from 0 (minimal) to 4 (most intense).Aortic Narrowing After Preterm Birth — an Mri StudyA K Edstedt Bonamy1, J Bengtsson2, H De Keyzer3, Z Nagy1, H Lagercrantz1, M Norman1,41Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Department of Medical Physics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 3Huddinge Children's Hospital, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 4Institution for Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsPreterm birth might permanently affect vascular structure and growth. We have previously found reduced diameter in the distal part of the aorta of adolescents born preterm. In the present study, we hypothesized that subjects born preterm have smaller aortas throughout the vessel course and investigated this hypothesis using MRI.Methods88 healthy adolescents (mean age 15 y) were included in the study; 46 born preterm weighing less than 1500g at birth and 42 controls born at term. Each participant underwent a single scanning session on a 1.5 T MR scanner. The protocol included a pulse-gated Fiesta sequence with 25 images within the heart cycle. Six 5mm thick slices were positioned 4.5cm apart, along the descending aorta. The first slice was positioned just below the iliac bifurcation. The aortas were segmented using a subpixel-precision Active Contour Model implemented in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Massachusetts, USA), permitting automatic calculations of end-diastolic aortic cross sectional areas. Blood pressure and heart rate were also recorded.Low Folate In Pregnancy — A Preventable Perinatal Risk Factor For Coronary Heart Disease?H Martin, B Lindblad, M NormanKarolinska Institutet, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsLow folate levels during pregnancy correlate with low birth weight (LBW), a perinatal risk factor for later coronary disease. Our aim was to study the relations between levels of folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine (Hcy) and vascular endothelial dysfunction — a key factor in early pathophysiology of coronary heart disease — in newborn infants with low or normal birth weight, and their mothers.MethodsWe used a laser-Doppler technique to measure skin perfusion before and after transdermal iontophoresis of acetylcholine (ACh; an endotheliumdependent vasodilator). Red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B12 and Hcy levels were measured in all subjects.Effects of Oral and Vaginal Indomethacin on Pulmonary Nitric Oxide and Endothelin-1 in Fetal RabbitsK D Beharry1, W Fortson2, H D Modanlou11Department of Pediatrics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach, CA, USABackground and AimsAntenatal indomethacin is associated with PPHN. Nitric oxide (NO) is a pulmonary vasodilator and its inhibition results in elevated pulmonary vascular resistance. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a vasoconstrictor that mediates pulmonary hypertension. Using a rabbit model for preterm birth, we compared the effects of oral and vaginal indomethacin on NO, cGMP, ET-1, and big ET-1 in fetal rabbit lungs.MethodsPregnant rabbits (n=6/group) were induced with RU486, prior to administration of oral indomethacin (OI, 20 mg); oral vehicle (OV); vaginal indomethacin (VI, 20 mg in cocoa butter); or vaginal cocoa butter (placebo, VP) once daily for 2 days. At delivery, fetal lung NO metabolites (NOx), cGMP, ET- 1, and big ET-1 were measured.Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (Icam-1, Cd54) and Plateletendothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule- 1 (Pecam-1, Cd31) Expression On Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (Huvec) in Oxidative Stress Induced by Tumor Necrosis Factor-AlfaM Szczepanski1, M Kamianowska1, K Wnuczko1, M Pietruczuk2, E Skrzydlewska3, S Wolczynski41Department of Neonatology, 2Department of Haematological Diagnostics, 3Department of Nonorganic and Analytical Chemistry, 4Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, Medical University of Bialystok, PolandBackground and AimsTumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) is one of the main cytokines of inflammatory and immunological response. It displays cytotoxic activity by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cell, which disturbs prooxidation — antioxidation balance, thus causing oxidative stress which initiates lipid peroxidation processes. The latest research proved that ROS are involved in the regulating of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression on the endothelial cells. In the present study, we examined an effect of oxidative stress (determining by malonyldialdehyde content) induced by TNF-α on ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).MethodsHuman umbilical vein endothelial cells were cultured in a standard medium (M 199). The culture cells were incubated for 6 hours with a TNF-α (10, 20, 40 ng/ml). In the HUVEC lysate, malonyldialdehyde (MDA), marker of fatty acids peroxidation, was measured by HPLC method. Expression levels of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 were quantified by flow cytometry.The Influence of Erythropoietin (Epo) on Intercellular Adhesion Molecule 1 (Icam-1, Cd54) And Plateletendothelial Cell Adhesion Molecule- 1 (Pecam-1, Cd31) Expression On Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells (Huvec) in Oxidative Stress Induced by High GM Szczepanski1, M Kamianowska1, K Wnuczko1, M Pietruczuk2, E Skrzydlewska3, S Wolczynski41Department of Neonatology, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland, 2Department of Haematological Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland, 3Department of Nonorganic and Analytical Chemistry, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland, 4Department of Gynecological Endocrinology, Medical University of Bialystok, PolandBackground and AimsHigh glucose concentrations disturb oxidation-reduction reaction leading to the increase of reactive oxygen species production. ROS are involved in ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression on endothelial cells. Erythropoietin displays cytoprotective effects. We examined an influence of oxidative stress induced by high glucose concentrations on ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 expression and an effect of Epo.MethodsSome HUVEC were pretreated (24 hours) with Epo (20 IU/ml). The control culture cells and the cells from Epo were incubated for 48 hours with glucose in concentrations 5,5; 11,1 and 22,2 mmol/l. In the HUVEC lysate malonyldialdehyde, was measured by HPLC. Expression of ICAM-1 and PECAM-1 were quantified by flow cytometry.Effect of Maternal Magnesium Sulfate on Red Cells Membrane Lipid Peroxidation — is There a Correlation with Clinical Outcome in Vlbwn?E M Gulczynska1, J Gadzinowski1, M Kesiak1, B Sobolewska1, A Grodzicka1, L Zylinska21Department of Neonatology, Research Institute of Polish Mother's Memorial Hospital, Lodz, Poland 2Department of Molecular Neurochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, PolandBackground and AimsMagnesium sulfate is nowadays suggested as a neuroprotective agent in VLBW. We evaluated whether they might have an effect on lipid peroxidation of erythrocytes membranes.MethodsThe study groups consist of neonates (≤1500g) born from mother receiving prenatally magnesium sulphate (n=24) and control group (n=20) without MgSO4. Lipid peroxidation in erythrocyte ghosts was determined as thiobarbituric acid reacting substances (TBARS). We have compared the TBARS level assessed in umbilical blood cord and after 24h of life. Simultaneously, the differences in neonatal outcome between antenatally exposed to MgSO4 neonates (n=78) and control group (n=293) VLBW neonates were analyzed.Flexible Fiberoptic Bronchoscopy in the Neonatal Intensive Care UnitE Arbel1, D Kohelet1,21Department of Neonatology, Edith Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel, 2Sackler School of Medicine, Tel-Aviv University, Tel-Aviv, IsraelBackground and AimsBronchoscopy is probably under-used procedure, usually because its diagnostic potential in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) is underrated. The study was carried out to evaluate the contribution of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB) and BAL to the clinical management of patients in a NICU. Setting and design: A retrospective study based on medical records in a nine-bed NICU of a tertiary care hospital.MethodsTwenty seven procedures were performed, for the following causes: search for airways anatomic pathologies (7); treatment of atelectasis and installation of surfactant (6); BAL (7), noisy breathing (2), aid to difficult intubation (1), aid to difficult extubation (3) and tracheotomy evaluation (2).Postnatal Changes of Pulmonary Pressures and Ductus Arteriosus Diameters Can Predict Latter Necessity for Pda TreatmentT Kovács, N Katona, M Bŕces, Z Horváth, E Polonkai, B Kovćs-Pśzthy, G BallaDivision of Neonatology, Department of Obstetrics, University of Debrecen, HungaryBackground and AimsHaemodynamic impact of ductal shunting occurs earlier than clinical symptoms develop. Timing of PDA treatment remains controversial.MethodsWe conducted a prospective analyses in infants who were ≤29 weeks of gestation. In 24 infants (mean: 760 g, 25.5 weeks) serial echocardiography were performed on 1,2,3,7 postnatal days, and when PDA was clinically suspected. The diameter of ductus arteriosus (DA) was assessed, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was estimated (velocity of tricuspid and pulmonary insufficiency, pulmonary acceleration time, direction and velocity of ductal shunting). PDA treatment was indicated when clinical or echocardiographic signs of volume overload were present. We collected data on presence of IVH grade IIV and BPD. Patients were divided into two subgroups at the end of study period: infants who later developed PDA necessiating treatment (group I, n=8) and who didn't (group II, n=16).Effect of Serum From Preeclampsia Mother and Her Neonatal Cord Blood on the Activity of Soluble Adhesion Molecules and Apoptosis in Cultured Human Umbilical Venous Endothelial CellsS Y Kim1, H S Kim1, C S Chun21Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University of Korea, Holy Family Hospital, Pucheon, South Korea 2Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University of Korea, Kang-Nam St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul, South KoreaBackground and AimsIt is proposed that endothelial cell dysfunction, as a central pathogenic feature of preeclampsia is caused by circulating unknown factors produced by placenta in the blood of women with preeclampsia. In this study we investigated the effect of such factors in the serum from preeclamptic mother or her neonatal umbilical vein on the activity of sICAM-1 and apoptosis in cultured human umbilical venous endothelial cells.MethodsQuantitive determinations of sICAM-1 and apoptosis were detected from isolated and cultured HUVEC supernatants which were incubated with serum samples for 48 hours. The serum samples were collected from preeclamptic mother and her neonatal cord blood in pairs according to gestational age and were compaired to nonpreeclamptic control groups.Ibuprofen Treatment of Patent Ductus Arteriosus is Associated with Transitory Renal Function ImpairmentS Johansson, A Rakow, M Bartocci, M Norman, M Vanpee, B JonssonDepartment of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsPDA-treatment with ibuprofen has been associated with little renal function impairment. We assessed urinary function during ibuprofen treatment, in a clinical setting.Methods83 infants (mean GA 27 wks, SD=2 wks) with echocardiographic PDA-diagnosis received ibuprofen (10+5+5 mg/kg). Pharmacological closure rate was 80%.Surgical PDA Ligation is Common Among 23–24 Week Preterm Infants Initially Treated with IbuprofenS Johansson, A Rakow, M Bartocci, M Norman, M Vanpee, B JonssonDepartment of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsMost published data on ibuprofen treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) have included few infants born at 23–24 gestational weeks. We determined PDA closure rates, stratified by gestational age, in a cohort of preterm infants with PDA, admitted to Karolinska University Hospital.MethodsDuring 2001–2004, 83 consecutive infants (mean gestational age 27 weeks, SD=2 weeks) received ibuprofen treatment due to echocardiographically confirmed PDA. Short term closure was assessed by echocardiography 18–24 hours after completed ibuprofen course. Surgical closure rate was assessed at discharge.Early Echocardiographic Findings as Predictors of Patency of Ductus ArterioususP Kwinta1, A Rudzinski2, P Kruczek1, Z Kordon2, J J Pietrzyk1Department of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, Poland, 2Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, PolandBackground and AimsProphylactic treatment with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors (PSI) can unnecessarily exposes infants to a drug. Alternative to routine prophylactic use of PSI is early treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The aim of the study was evaluation of prognostic value of early echocardiographic study with respect to PDA in later life.Methods60 preemies with mean birthweight 1087g were included into prospective study. The cardiac scans were performed at the entry into the study (at the age 12–48 hour of life) and further in case of suspicion of PDA or obligatory at the 7th and 28th day of life. There was no prophylactic or treatment use of PSI during the study. Newborns were divided into 2 cohorts: With significant left to right shunt requiring ligation of PDA (n=16) or without significant PDA (n=44).Peripheral Fractional Oxygen Extraction and Tissue Oxygenation Index in Term Neonates with in Utero Exposure to SmokingG Pichler1, B Urlesberger1, J Heizinger1, P Klaritsch2, J Kutschera1, H Zotter1, W Müller11Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Graz, Austria, 2Division of Obstetrics, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Medical University of Graz, AustriaBackground and AimsAim of the present study was to analyse the influence of in utero exposure to smoking on peripheral oxygenation in healthy term neonates.Methods13 term healthy neonates with in utero exposure to smoking were compared to 13 term healthy neonates without in utero exposure to smoking. Measurements were performed during first week of life. Neonates were matched for gestational age, actual weight and postnatal age at time of measurement. Peripheral oxygenation was measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in combination with the venous occlusion method on the left forearm. Fractional oxygen extraction (FOE) and tissue oxygenation index (TOI) were analysed. Central and peripheral temperatures were measured continuously. By means of pulsoximetry heart rate and peripheral arterial oxygen saturation were measured continuously. Arterial blood pressure was measured before and after venous occlusions.Birthweight and Gestational Age are Predictors of Ductal Closure Following Ibuprofen TreatmentG J Richards, A Johnson, G F Fox, M E CampbellNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, St Thomas’ Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsLower gestational age is a recognised risk factor for the development of a clinically significant patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Rates of successful PDA closure with indomethacin treatment are reduced in extremely premature infants. There are no data describing the rate of PDA closure following intravenous (IV) ibuprofen treatment in the most immature infants.MethodsData were collected on all babies &lt;1000g birthweight admitted to a tertiary NICU who received IV ibuprofen for treatment of a clinically symptomatic PDA. A successful outcome was defined as PDA closure following a course of ibuprofen treatment, data were analysed for factors influencing treatment outcome.The Cost-Utility of Palivizumab in Children with Congenital Heart Disease in GermanyM Nuijten1, M Lebmeier2,3, W Wittenberg31Ars Accessus Medica, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK, 3Global Health Economics and Outcomes Research, Abbott GmbH &amp; Co.

Thus, this study examines children's perceptions of genetic illnesses and understanding of probabilistic information.MethodsChildren's perceptions of genetics were explored through a write-and-draw task. A probabilistic choice task including label, percentage, ratio and pie chart formats examined understanding of probability. One condition included a mixture of formats.The Magic of the Words: The Impact of Storytelling on Sick ChildrenM Andresen, H S Korsgaard, C BlixThe Children's Program 4074, National Hospital, Copenhagen, DenmarkBackground and AimsChildren and their parents need all possible support to cope with the challenges they face through long term treatment. Storytelling have a comeback, which has inspired to let two professional storytellers, ‘The Blue Witch’ of ‘Bowler Granny’, tell stories for sick children. The aim of the study was to get experience with the impact of storytelling on severe sick children. An intermediate aim was to stimulate the children's desire for reading, and to give both children and their parents a coping strategy through their long term stay at the hospital.MethodsData was collected through observations and videoshuts of the episodes with storytelling, and from questionnaires to the parents, and the logbooks of the storytellers. The target group were children between 3 and 9 years old, who spoke Danish, and who were treated for a severe, acute or chronic, disease. Data was collected through 3 weeks. 5 children were followed in between 3 and 8 story episodes (13 hours of videotaping).Attitudes of Nurse Professionals and Nursing Students Toward Children with DisabilitiesV Matziou1, H Brokalaki, P Galanis, E Gymnopoulou, C TsoumakasFaculty of Nursing, University of Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsToday, some people still address children with disabilities with prejudice that leaves them with unhappy feelings. This problem becomes more intense when health professionals and especially nurses have not the proper sensitivity and attitude toward them. We aimed to study perceptions and attitudes of nurse professionals and nursing students towards children with disabilities.MethodsThe study population included 228 (52%) first year nursing students, 90 (20%) postgraduate nursing students κατ 123 (28%) nurse professionals who work in pediatric hospitals in Athens. Participants have answered the questionnaire of Yuker, Block and Younng.

This has been practise in the past and still is. Parents do not in all NICUs have unlimited access to their infants. When transported in ambulances they are not allowed either. The aim for most Danish NICUs care is that parents should have an unlimited access, to their children. We suggest that this will enable the parents to obtain self confidence in abilities to take care of their child, and thus be able to act and decide advocating their child's best interests. As a result the families regain the autonomy and their parental competence, which was disturbed by hospitalisation in NICU.MethodsA national SIG-group organized under The Danish Paediatric Nurse Association, has during the last years had focus on facilitating the implementation of Family Centred Care. As a group we have taught and informed about this subject, during national conferences and teaching sessions using expert nurses, psychologist, master NIDCAP-Trainers, family- therapists and hospital priests.Nursing Attitude Towards End of Life Decisions — How We Deal with it!M Cicak Novak, M NovakDivision for Neonatology and Intensive Care, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Center Zagreb, CroatiaBackground and AimsMost deaths in pediatric intensive care unit are not unexpected; they follow limitation or withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment (LST). The nursing stuff attitude towards such decisions between nurses in neonatal, pediatric, adult neurosurgical intensive care unit, and general pediatric ward was investigated.MethodsA prospective, descriptive study based on a survey was conducted. A questionnaire was sent to nurses from all the mentioned divisions. The attitude about active/passive euthanasia; nursing care at the end of life; pain management; symptom management; ethical/legal issues; cultural and especially religious consideration in end-of life care; communication with parents/family and family presence; grief, loss, and bereavement; achieving quality at the end of life. The opinion about nursing role in LST withdrawal decisions was investigated.Parenting in NICUL W Wellejus, B PallesgaardHvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen, DenmarkBackground and AimsIn Denmark the parents are alowed in the NICU 24 hours a day. The staff offer a lot of time, teaching the parents how to nurse their infant meening bathing the infant, changing the diper, taking care of the tubefeeding and many other things. The parents learn all these things very early in the pathway. This means that the infant very ealy are nursed mainly from their parents hands.MethodsEven very sick infants will be nursed and held by their parents as much as possible. It is very important for us, that the infants as erly as possible are taken out of the incubator to lay on their mothers or fathers chest, so they can share the feeling of oneanothers skin (‘kangaru-method’). We do that even with infants in the respirator. In very rare cases, where the infants need to stay in the incubator (eg. with thorax-drains), we teach the parents how to sit by the incubator with their hands quiet around the infant.End of Life Care in a PICU: Parental and Staff PerspectivesA Tagarro, P Dorao, R Tapia, S Moraleda, P López, T Moreno, C Schüffelmann, F RuzaPICU, La Paz Children's Hospital, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsTo evaluate the end-of-life care in a PICU from parental and staff point of view, to compare perceptions, and to get information to design proper guidelines.MethodsParents of patients died from 2001 to 2003 and staff completed one questionnaire designed to test the information, the environment, the accuracy of care in the moment of death, and bereavement care.Children with Chronic Diseases: A Challenge to Family TherapiesC Pogonidis1, E Xenodoxidou2, I Christodoulou3, C Vaiopoulos1, K Godosidis4, M Livaditis4, T K Konstantinidis51Xanthi Hospital, Thrace, Greece, 2Sismanoglion Hospital, Komotini, Thrace, Greece, 3Papanikolaou General Hospital, Thessaloniki, Greece, 4Department of Psychiatry, Medical School, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece, 5Laboratory of Hygiene and Environment Protection, Democritus University of Thrace, GreeceBackground and AimsAim of this study is to focus in problems arising in families with children suffering from chronic diseasesMethodsIn total 17 families were studied in Thrace, Greece. A questionnaire was completed assessing children and parents’ everyday problems. A special concern was given to brothers and sisters of children with a chronic disease. We did not ask any questions to the young patients themselves.Can Palliative Care Outreach Offer an Alternative to Picu?A P Anderson, F CraigGreat Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsClinicians have a duty not to ask families to consent to a treatment that does not have a realistic chance of recovery. We investigate the scope for a palliative care outreach service and determine if this may help children and families avoid inappropriate PICU admission.MethodsA retrospective case note review of children, known to the palliative care service, who were referred to PICU, by their local hospital during an acute illness.The Oropharyngeal Colonization of Children at the Admission in a Pediatric Intensive Care UnitM L G Pedreira1, M I Gomes1, D M Kusahara1, M A S Peterlini1, M Abramczyk21Department of Nursing, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, 2Department of Pediatric, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilBackground and AimsThe oropharyngeal colonization of critical care patients has been described as capable of increasing nosocomial infections. The oropharynx is usually considered the main reservoir of bacterial colonies in the upper airways. The aim of this study was to verify the oropharyngeal colonization of children at the first 24 hours of admission in a PICU.MethodsProspective study realized in a University Hospital PICU in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The study was approved by the ethics research committee. The sample was composed of 32 children. Microbiological cultures were obtained during the first 24 hours after children's admission, and collected swabbing by tonsils and pharyngeal areas. The collected oropharyngeal secretion were inoculated on culture media and incubated according to atmosphere, temperature, time and humidity standards.Clinical Utility of the Multidimensional Assessment Pain ScaleA S RameletSchool of Nursing and Midwifery, Curtin University of Technology and Nursing Research, Princess Margaret Hospital for Children, Perth, WA, AustraliaBackground and AimsEven if an assessment tool has sound psychometric properties, if it is not feasible for use in a clinical setting or does not provide useful clinical information, then it is of little value to clinicians. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical utility of the Multidimensional Assessment Pain Scale (MAPS) for critically ill young preverbal children.MethodsUsefulness of the MAPS was tested in a convenience sample of 19 children aged between 0 and 31 months who had major surgery at a tertiary referral hospital in Western Australia. The other components of clinical utility, such as ease of use, format and scoring, were evaluated by 17 staff nurses who completed an anonymous 5-point Lykert type scale questionnaire.Complication and Outcome in Children Requiring Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for Staphylococcus Aureus PneumoniaG N Feketea, A J Patsoura, A G Eliades, D D Gionis, J H PapadatosPICU, “P.&amp;A. Kyriakou” Children's Hospital, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsDespite advances in antibiotic therapy strategies and in pediatric intensive care, Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia remains a serious infection.MethodsTreatment, complication and outcome of children with severe Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia were reviewed.Does Climate Change Influence Blood TSH Concentrations in Healthy Newborns?C De Felice1, L Peruzzi2, M Musaro'2, L Cecchi3, M Morabito3, G Latini4,5, G Tonni6, G Bartolini3, G Maracchi7, S Orlandini31Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy, 2Laboratory of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics, and Reproductive Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy, 3Interdepartmental Centre of Bioclimatology, University of Florence, Florence, Italy 4Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Lecce, Italy, 5Division of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy, 6Division of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Guastalla Civil Hospital — AUSL Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy, 7Institute of Biometeorology, National Research Council of Italy (IBIMET-CNR), Florence, ItalyBackground and AimsEmerging concern exists about possible health effects of climate change. Summer 2003 is known as the hottest in the last 400 years in Northern Europe. Although a possible effect of high air temperature on TSH levels has been previously reported in experimental models, to date no information exists on this phenomenon in human newborns. We tested the hypothesis that neonatal blood TSH concentrations on day 3 are inversely related with the air temperature, as assessed on a congenital hypothyroidism (CH) mass screening program.MethodsWhole blood T4 and TSH concentrations on day 3 were evaluated in 32,091 newborns in South-Eastern Tuscany, Italy, sampled from January 1999 to December 2003. Monthly air temperatures for 9 weather stations covering the geographical area of birth were obtained from the regional database. Cases with proven CH or other known thyroid diseases were excluded from the study. T4 and TSH concentrations on filter paper-adsorbed whole blood specimens (DELFIA) were evaluated.Fresh-Frozen Plasma as a Source of Exogenous IGF-1 to the Very Preterm InfantI Hansen-Pupp1, E Engströ2, A Niklasson2, V Fellman1, A Hellströ3, C Löqvist2, D Ley11Department of Pediatrics, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, 2Department of Pediatrics, Institute of Clinical Sciences, Göeborg, Sweden, 3Department of Ophtalmology, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Göeborg, SwedenBackground and AimsPreterm birth is followed by an immediate decrease in circulatory levels of IGF-1. The aim of the study was to evaluate effect of intravenous administration of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) on levels of IGF-1 in preterm infants.MethodsFFP from adult donors was administered to 17 infants (mean GA 25.5 wks) at a median (range) age of 3 (1–29) days. Serum IGF-1 was analyzed in administered FFP, in neonatal blood before and after FFP transfusion, and 6, 12, 24 and 48 h later.Continuous Glucose Monitoring in Very Low Birthweight InfantsI Iglesias Platas1, M Thió Lluch1, N Pociello Almiñana2, A Morillo Palomo1, M Iriondo Sanz1, X Krauel Vidal11Servei de Nounats, Agrupació Sanitaria Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Hospital Clínic, Barcelona, Spain 2Servei de Pediatría, Hospital Sant Joan de Déu, Barcelona, SpainBackground and AimsDefinition of optimal levels of blood glucose in newborns remains controversial. Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) infants are at a higher risk for disturbances in glucose homeostasis. Hypoglycaemia may worsen neurodevelopmental outcomes, while hyperglycaemia contributes to risk of intraventricular haemorrhage and sepsis. Our aims were to study actual levels of blood glucose in VLBW infants and to validate a method of continuous glucose monitoring in these patients.MethodsExtremely premature VLBW infants receiving intensive care were recruited within the first 24 hours from delivery. A subcutaneous sensor connected to a Continuous Glucose Monitoring System® (Medtronics) was maintained during 7 days or until dysfunction. Management of patients followed usual standard protocols.Incidence and Etiological Study of Non-Nosocomial Neonatal PneumoniaR Lien1, H R Huang1, P H Yang1, T Y Lin2, Y C Huang21Divisions of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan-R.O.C., 2Division of Infectious Disease, Department of Pediatrics, Chang Gung Children's Hospital, Chang Gung University, Taoyuan, Taiwan-R.O.C.Background and AimsThere's a lack of clinical information as regard to the incidence and etiology of neonatal pneumonia due to uncertainty of case definitions, rate differences in patient populations, and ascertainment bias. To establish the incidence and investigate the common infectious etiologies of nonnosocomial neonatal pneumonia in northern Taiwan.MethodsThis is a retrospective study by reviewing medical records from 2000 to 2005. Those who had the diagnosis of pneumonia with disease onset prior to or upon admission, or no later than the first 96 hours of hospital stay, who also had simultaneous laboratory studies for infectious microorganism and changes on the chest x-ray, were included in the study. They were divided into early and late onset pneumonia, indicating pneumonia in infants younger and older than 48 hours of age.Permanent Histopathological Changes on the Heart After Neonatal Dexamethasone Treatment. Studies in 4, 8 and 50-Week Old Wistar RatsW B de Vries1, M P Bal1,2,3, P Homoet-van der Kraak4, P Steendijk2, F R Van Der Leij3, J Baan2, M F M Van Oosterhout4, F van Bel11Department of Neonatology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Cardiology, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands, 3Department of Pediatrics, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands 4Department of Pathology, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsDespite beneficial effects of neonatal Dexamethasone (Dex) in preterm infants with chronic lung disease on the short term, there are multiple side-effects such as transient myocardial hypertrophy and hypertension. We reported a temporary suppression of cardiomyocyte proliferation in neonatal rats after neonatal Dex, possibly inducing persistent alterations in cardiac morphology (Basic Res Cardiol 2006). Our aim was to perform histopathological investigations after neonatal Dex in the juvenile and adult rat heart.MethodsRat pups received Dex on day 1, 2 and 3 of life (0.5, 0.3 and 0.1ug/g ip). Control pups received saline (Sal). At 4, 8 and 50 week of life the rats were sacrificed (n=8/group). Anatomic data were collected and heart tissue sections were stained with HE, Cadherin-PAS and Sirius Red for cardiomyocyte morphometry and collagen determination.Melatonin and Retardation of CNS Development in Iugr Newborn InfantsI EvsyukovaDepartment of Physiology and Pathology of Newborn of D.O. Ott Research Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology RAMS, St. Petersburg, RussiaBackground and AimsThe aim of this study is to assess the role of melatonin (MT) in pathogenesis of retardation CNS development and perinatal pathology in IUGR newborn infants.MethodsClinical and laboratory investigations with electropoligraphic characteristics of the cycle organization of sleep were performed in 112 IUGR and 63 normal full term neonates (control group). Expression of MT in platelets and their aggregation activity were investigated. Excretion of the main MT metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6SMT) in diurnal (09.00 to 21.00 h) and nocturnal urine (21.00 to 09.00 h) in 1, 4, 10 days of life were determined.Continuous Computer Analysis of Spo2 and Arterial Blood Gases in Very Low Birth Weight Infants (Vlbwi) With PdaP Kruczek1, P Stoch3, A Rudzinski2, P Kwinta1, Z Kordon2, W Wajs3, J J Pietrzyk11Department of Pediatrics, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland, 2Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Collegium Medicum, Jagiellonian University, Krakow, Poland, 3Department of Automatics, Institute of Metallurgy and Mining, Krakow, PolandBackground and AimsRespiratory distress syndrome (RDS) — severe consequence of prematurity leads to further complications including persistent ductus arteriosus (PDA). The goal of the study is to test hypothesis that severity of RDS increases risk of PDA in VLBWI.Methods51 VLBWI admitted to Neonatal Intensive Care Unit till the second day of life between January 2004 and October 2005 were included into study group. Blood gases were checked on admission and in day 3, pulsoximetry saturations (SpO2) were continuously recorded during first week of hospitalization. Chest Xray (CXR) was taken on admission, the severity of RDS was graded (scale 0–4). Echocardiographic evaluation of hemodynamic significance of PDA was performed in day 1 and 7, the study group was divided into PDA (−) and PDA (+). SpO2, FiO2/pO2, pH and severity of RDS in CXR were compared in both groups.Volume of Activity and Nurses’ Staffing Level in Neonatal Intensive Care Units. Results of A Repeated Measure Cross Sectional Study in ItalyC Corchia, S M OrlandoDepartment of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsVolume of activity and staff workload in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) could be relevant to the quality of care and outcome of high risk infants. The aims of our study were to describe the distribution of some variables reflecting the volume of activity of Italian NICUs, and to investigate the relationship between these variables and the staffing level.MethodsOne hundred and four NICUs participated in a nationwide investigation from May to December 2005. The following data were collected monthly at specified points in time, representing both weekdays and weekends, and including all possible nursing shifts: Number of ventilated or NCPAP-cared infants (intensive patients, IPs), Number of nurses in the intensive care section (ICN) of each NICU, and Infant to Staff ratio (ISr), calculated dividing IPs by ICN. Medians and Interquartile ranges (IQR) of each variable were calculated, and their distribution and possible variations over time were assessed.Blood Pressure (Bp) Waves Are Due to Noradrenaline Surges in Newborn InfantsB Wefers, S Cunningham, J Quinn, N McIntoshDepartment of Neonatology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UKBackground and AimsMaintenance of BP within a ‘normal range’ is important for perfusion of vital organs and avoidance of perfusion related insults to the neonatal brain. Hypertensive neonatal BP waves have been described by our research team and have been linked to more severe neonatal illness. An increased risk of cerebral pathology in these infants has been postulated. However the mechanism behind these waves remained unclear (Cunningham et. al., 1993). We investigated plasma catecholamine levels when hypertensive BP waves were observed.MethodsTrained clinical staff notified the investigator when hypertensive BP waves were seen on the computerised trend monitoring system (CPTM). Blood samples were taken at the peak and trough of BP waves from the indwelling arterial line used to monitor the infant's BP. Catecholamine levels were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography with dual electrode coulochem detection. Mean BP recorded by CPTM at the time of sampling was correlated to plasma adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine levels using the Wilcoxon signed ranked test.Long Term Physical Effects in Survivors of Pediatric Intensive CareH Knoester1, M B Bronner2, A P Bos11Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Psychosocial Department, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThe development of pediatric intensive care (IC) has contributed to improved survival in critically ill children. Little is known about long term physical sequelae in pediatric IC survivors, but they might resemble the findings in adult IC survivors. Awareness of sequelae due to the original illness and its treatment may result in changes in management during the acute phase. The purpose of this study was to evaluate physical sequelae of survivors of Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICU).MethodsFrom December 2002 through October 2005 all acute admissions to our PICU, were examined in the out-patient follow-up clinic, three months after discharge. A pediatric intensivist evaluated physical sequelae by standardized history taking and physical examination.Should we Continue Care After 1 Month Stay in the Icu?S Naghib1,2, C Van Der Starre1, E Van Der Voort2, S Gischler1, K F M Joosten2, D Tibboel11Department of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 2Department of Pediatrics, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsOverall mortality in PICU is 4–7%, but the mortality in the group children with a length of stay of more than 1 month (&gt; 4 times median duration of stay) might be much higher.MethodsChildren up to the age of 18 who fulfilled the criteria of prolonged stay (&gt; 28 days) were included in our University children's hospital and multidisciplinary intensive care unit. The design was a retrospective analysis over a 3-year interval (2003–2005).Organ Donation from A Pediatric Intensive Care Unit in GreeceF C Nikolaou, K G Papazoglou, J H PapadatosIntensive Care Unit, Children's Hospital ‘P&amp;A. Kyriakou’, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsCurrent demand for organs far surpasses availability all over the world, waiting lists are long and many people die before the organ they desperately need becomes available. The purpose of this paper is to estimate the number of potential donors and the organ donation/transplantation rate in the pediatric population.MethodsAll deaths in the PICU at the Children Hospital “P &amp; A Kyriakou” during the last ten years were checked for brain death (BD). These patients were valued as possible organ and tissue donors. The number of donors and the causes for not donation were estimated.Long Term Psychological Effects in Survivors of Pediatric Intensive CareM B Bronner1, H Knoester2, A P Bos2, M A Grootenhuis1, B F Last11Department of Psychosocial, Emma Children's Hospital AMC, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Emma Children's Hospital AMC, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsAdmission to a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is a stressful event associated with both psychological and physical long term consequences. Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has been frequently mentioned as a psychological consequence. The purpose of this study was to examine the prevalence of PTSD in families after an acute PICU admission and to determine the contribution of different medical risk factors to the development of PTSD.MethodsFrom December 2002 through October 2005 we did follow-up research in the Emma's children's hospital, Amsterdam. Families filled out PTSD questionnaires three months after discharge. A total of 143 families participated in this study with 27 children older than 8 years, 140 mothers and 107 fathers.Predictors of Survival in Infants Transferred for Consideration of Extracorporeal Life Support (Ecls)L Mills1, S Rodger1, M Liddell2, J Simpson2, C Davis2, C Skeoch1, L Jackson11West of Scotland Neonatal Transport Service, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UK, 2Extra Corporeal Life Support Service, Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Glasgow, UKBackground and AimsECLS is an established therapy for neonates with a high risk of death from respiratory failure and is available in 4 UK centres. No standardised criteria for initiating ECLS transfer exist although the oxygenation index (OI) has been used historically. Aim: To review factors influencing the mortality of infants transferred to Glasgow as potential candidates for ECLS.MethodsA retrospective case note review incorporating the West of Scotland Neonatal Transport Database. Factors influencing survival were identified using bi-variate correlation. Binary logistic regression was used to identify independent determinants of survival.

In Belgium and The Netherlands approximately 60% of all deaths are preceded by an end-of-life decision (Provoost 2005 and Vrakking 2005). The end-of-life decision is sometimes followed by the use of drugs to alleviate pain and discomfort. A retrospective and prospective study to get more insight into reasons for withdrawal and medication prescribed was performed.MethodsMany neonatologists in European countries set limits to intensive care treatment (Cuttini, 2000). In Belgium and The Netherlands approximately 60% of all deaths are preceded by an end-of-life decision (Provoost 2005 and Vrakking 2005). The end-of-life decision is sometimes followed by the use of drugs to alleviate pain and discomfort. A retrospective and prospective study to get more insight into reasons for withdrawal and medication prescribed was performed.Efficacy of Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics in Reduction of Venipuncture Pain in ChildrenE Stefanaki, G N Konstantinou, C Petraki, A Tsilimigaki-Christaki, T TsekouraDepartment of Second Pediatric, Venizelio General Hospital, Heraklio, Crete, GreeceBackground and AimsAcute pain caused by common minor procedures, such as venipuncture, can be a major source of distress for hospitalized children. Our objective is to explore the efficacy of a mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine cream [Eutectic mixture of local anesthetics (EMLA)] and of other social parameters such as educational status in reducing pain during venipuncture.Methods97 children aged from 3 to 14 years old, who were hospitalized and required venipuncture, were enrolled in a randomized, single blind placebo controlled trial.

For many years, treatment has centered on the use of physiotherapy and orthoses to overcome these problems. Intramuscular botulinum toxin (BT-A) offers a targeted form of therapy to reduce spasticity in specific muscle groups, though the high cost is a limiting factor for it's ready application in the developing countries. We tried to compare the effectiveness of it's different doses to choose the least expensive regimen which produces the desired effect.MethodsForty-five patients with spastic diplegia were enrolled, and were randomly divided into 3 groups each with 15 patients. Patients in the first group received 5 units/kg/leg of BT-A, and the patients in the 2nd and 3rd groups received 10 and 15 units/kg/leg of BT-A respectively. The outcome was assessed six weeks later by video gait analysis, gross motor function measure (GMFM), and passive ankle dorsiflexion.Orthopaedic Surgery on Equine Feet for Children with Spastic Cerebral PalsyI G Nazarov1, I G Nazarov21Medical University of Moscow, Moscow, Russia 2University of Pediatric Surgery, Moscow, RussiaBackground and AimsThe deformities of the equine feet of children with CP are the consequences of contractures of soft tissues. The elimination of these contractures that would permit increasing the capacity of movement would favour the development of the motor system.Methodsthe surgical intervention that I practice to eliminate the contractures of the soft tissues for 10 years, consists of performing small surgical incisions in the contracted fibers. In order to carry this out, one uses a sharp scalpel that allows one to surgically intervene just subcutaneously. The patient will find the post-operation to experience very little trauma. In order to conduct this research, 188 equine feet were operated on 120 children. Traditional methods were used for the medical research before and after these operations and at the end of 1–4 years after the operations were performed.Psychiatric Symptoms in Adolescents Born by Mothers Who Smoked in PregnancyM S Indredavik1, P Romundstad2, A M Brubakk3, T Vik21Department of Neuroscience, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, 2Department of Public Health and General Practice, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway, 3Department of Laboratory Medicine, Children's and Women's Health, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, NorwayBackground and AimsTo study the association between smoking in pregnancy and psychiatric symptoms in the adolescent offspring.Methods84 adolescents born by women who had been randomly selected before week 20 of pregnancy as participants in a multicenter study were examined at age 14 years.

Dilute gastrograffin can be consumed (either orally or via nasogastric tube) up to 500 ml volume, with a typical “NPO” time interval of 30–90 minutes between ingestion and acquisition of CT images. Many pediatric patients require sedation to ensure immobility. The aspiration risk of pediatric patient's with oral contrast who undergo subsequent sedation for CT imaging, has never been specifically studied.MethodsAt Boston Children's Hospital, there is a defined sedation protocol for patient's undergoing CT sedation after ingestion of oral gastrograffin. There are defined clinical criteria which must be met for a patient to receive sedation. Absolute contraindications would include uncontrolled/unpredictable vomiting or gastroesophageal reflux, or a positive swallow study. Sedation consists of intravenous pentobarbital with fentanyl, if needed. A computerized sedation database tracks patient demographics and outcome. This database was retrospectively queried for aspiration events on all patients who received oral contrast with subsequent sedation since 1997.Pattern of Prescribing Medications By Paediatricians and Child PsychiatristsH F Ayyash1, M Omran1, R Verity2, M Thomas21Department of Paediatrics, Doncaster Royal Infirmary, Doncaster, South Yorkshire, UK, 2CAMHS and Adult Mental Health Team, Rotherham, Doncaster &amp; South Humber NHS Trust, UKBackground and AimsTo find out if there are differences in the regime of prescribing of stimulant and non-stimulant medications in Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) patients who are treated by Paediatricians and Child Psychiatrists.MethodsWe reviewed the case notes of ADHD patients aged 15 to 16 years old who were treated in a Paediatric Service in Doncaster and a neighbouring CAMHS Service in Rotherham.

Aim of this study is to report the experience of General Practitioners in pediatric trauma in Thrace, Greece.MethodsIn total 1250 cases of pediatric trauma were treated in Health Center of Iasmos during past decade. The children were 767 male, and 483 female, with a median age of 8±2,57 years old. General Practition applied was reported and evaluated. A categorization in three groups was made, according to age: A (&lt;2 months), B (1–5 years old) and C (5–14 years old).Spectrum of Services in a Pediatric, Non-University Hospital: The Drg (Diagnosis Related Groups) PerspectiveM L LosaDepartment of Pediatrics, Ostschweizer Kinderspital, St. Gallen, SwitzerlandBackground and AimsThe reimbursement of hospitals by means of patient classifications schemes is actively discussed in Switzerland. In view of the experiences from Germany, considerable problems with financing are to be feared equally in Switzerland particularly for pediatric hospitals and departments.MethodsThe patient data for 2004 and 2005 were processed by a DRG-Grouper (APDRG-Grouper version 1.5, swiss-cw version 5.1). The resulting DRG-data were analysed using MS-Excel tables.Improving the Completeness of Data in a Clinical Information SystemB A H Versluis1,2, M W Herrewijn2, W G Ista2, J A Hazelzet2, M De Mul31Directorate Information, Department of Management and Maintenance Information Systems, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2PICU/NICU, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 3Institute of Health Policy and Management, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsImplementing and maintaining a Patient Data management System (PDMS) is an ongoing process. Eight years after the implementation of the PDMS, we experienced that complete and accurate recording of data was not self-evident. As missing or unvalidated data may negatively influence care of the patients we used a multilevel approach to improve completeness. The aim is to improve the documentation of the clinical data by the PICU physicians and nurses.MethodsOn the technical level, we have tailored the PDMS to meet our recording needs, by adding icons that launched a number of automatic data entries to the system. After a procedure, e.g. an arterial line insertion, the application will, after clicking an icon, launch an orderset and document an event automatically. By a “breakthrough”-approach physicians and nurses were stimulated to improve documentation and to do this on an unambiguous manner. During the process we collected different real time variables related to procedures and compared these with the imported events by the PICU staff. Every month, the results were presented graphically to the team.Children Under Three Years of Age Presenting to the Emergency Department with Skull and Long Bone Fractures, are We Recognising the Signs of Non-Accidental Injury?T W Bourke, V K Kumar, N P CorriganDepartment of Paediatrics, Altnagelvin Area Hospital, Londonderry, Northern Ireland, UKBackground and AimsA child injury surveillance proforma exists in our emergency department to help distinguish accidental injuries from those requiring further expert assessment. We wished to establish if this proforma was being used effectively in patients with identifiable risk factors for non-accidental injury (NAI).MethodsAll patients under three years of age with skull and long bone fractures attending our emergency department in a one-year period were identified. Notes were retrospectively audited for documentation of proven risk factors for NAI.Near Infrared Spectroscopy Identifies a Significant Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm InfantsM P Sherman1,2, M A Underwood1, J M Milstein11Department of Pediatrics, University of California, Davis, CA, USA, 2Department of Pediatrics, Southern Illinois University, Springfield, IL, USABackground and AimsPatent ductus arteriosus [PDA] is a frequent and potentially pathologic condition in preterm infants. A simple bedside screening tool to assess ductal patency would assist in the care of extremely low birthweight [ELBW] infants. Our aim was to study the utility of near-infrared spectroscopy [NIRS] to identify a hemodynamically significant PDA in ELBW infants.MethodsTissue oxygen saturation was measured by NIRS in the lungs, brain, skeletal muscle and kidney of 20 ELBW infants. Comparisons were made between the tissue saturation in these organs and the presence or absence of a significant PDA by echocardiography. All studies were performed within the first 2 weeks of life.The Prognostic Value of Amplitude Integrated EEG in Neonatal Sepsis/MeningitisH J ter Horst, H de Vries, A F BosDepartment of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsAmplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) is a powerful tool to predict neurological outcome following asphyxia. Neonatal sepsis/meningitis is also known to cause mortality and neurological morbidity. We aimed to investigate the longitudinal course and prognostic value of aEEG traces in newborns suffering sepsis/meningitis.MethodsMedical records of 13 infants that had suffered from sepsis/meningitis and had aEEG recordings were retrospectively investigated. Mean gestational age was 39,3 weeks; birth weight 3490 grams. 12 infants suffered from meninigitis (11 bacterial [2 E. Coli/9 GBS], 1 viral [enterovirus]); 1 infant had an E. Coli-sepsis. AEEG recordings were assessed by pattern recognition: background pattern, presence of sleep wake cycling (SWC) and epileptic activity (EA) were appraised. Recordings during the first 72 hours were used for analysis. 2 infants died; 3 had an abnormal neurologic development and 8 were normal at follow up.Amplitude Integrated EEG in Preterm Infants with Hypotension and Periventricular LeucomalaciaH J ter Horst1, T Tameling1, L A van Eykern2, A F Bos11Department of Pediatrics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, 2Department of Developmental Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsAmplitude integrated EEG (aEEG) changes with gestational age (GA). Brain activity is dependent on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation. Brain ischemia is a major factor contributing to development of periventricular leucomalacia (PVL). We aimed to investigate if PVL and hypotension influence aEEG in preterms during the first weeks of life.MethodsAEEG was recorded in 13 infants with GA of 26–32,9 weeks (median 31 wk), birth weight was 635–1805 gram (median 1200 g). Longitudinal aEEG was digitally recorded at weekly intervals until discharge. AEEG was assessed by pattern recognition. In addition the highest, lowest and mean values of the 5th, 50th and 95th centile of aEEG amplitudes were calculated. PVL was diagnosed by serial cranial ultrasound and hypotension by the necessity for vaso-active agents.Regional Blood Flow Adaptation in the Week Following Surgical Pda LigationS Hoodbhoy, H Cutting, M E CampbellDepartment of Neonatal, Guy's and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UKBackground and AimsAbnormalities in regional blood flow have been reported in babies with a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Our aim was to describe regional vascular adaptation to surgical PDA ligation in infants &lt;1500g.MethodsDoppler measurements of average velocity (AV) from middle cerebral (MCA), celiac (CA), and superior mesenteric (SMA) arteries were performed preoperatively, at 3–6 hours, 24 hours and 1 week post ligation.Cerebral Blood Flow Velocity by Pulsed Doppler Ultrasound in Full Term Infants with AsphyxiaM Julkunen1,2, M Janas2, R L Seppänen3, O Tammela1,21The Pediatric Research Centre, University of Tampere, Tampere, Finland, 2Department of Paediatrics, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland, 3Unit of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, FinlandBackground and AimsTo evaluate the correlation between cerebral blood velocities by pulsed Doppler ultrasound, severity of hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) and outcome at 1 year's age in asphyxiated newborns.MethodsThirty term infants (GA 37–42 weeks) with birth asphyxia (5 min Apgar 5 or less) and 30 healthy age-and sex-matched controls underwent pulsed Doppler ultrasound examinations three times during the first 24 hours of life. Systolic cerebral blood flow velocities (SCBFV) of anterior cerebral (ACA), basilar (BA) and internal carotid (ICA) arteries were measured. HIE was graded using modified Sarnat criteria (stage 0–3). Motor development by Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) was assessed at 1 year's age.Electroencephalographic Response to Procedural Pain in Healthy Newborn InfantsE Norman1, I Rosén2, V Fellman1,3, S Vanhatalo4, K Stjernqvist5, O Ökland6, L Hellströ-Westas11Department of Paediatrics, Institution of Clinical Science, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden 2Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Institution of Clinical Science, Lund University Hospital, Lund, Sweden, 3Department of Paediatrics, University Hospital of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, 4Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, University Hospital of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, 5Department of Psychology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden, 6Department of Paediatrics, Åesund Hospital, Åesund, NorwayBackground and AimsA recent study (Fernandez et al, 2003) reported that painful or unpleasant stimuli in newborns result in measurable changes in frontal theta (3–6 Hz) activity, attenuated by oral glucose. We aimed at investigating the type and magnitude of frontal EEG responses to nociceptive stimuli in a larger group, undergoing different types of noxious procedures.MethodsHealthy term infants were investigated (n=72), 28 (group 1) underwent a heel prick (non skin-breaking procedure from the Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale). Prior to the heel-prick, 16 of the 28 infants received oral glucose and 12 water (randomised, double-blind). Group 2 (n=21) underwent a venous blood sample from the dorsum of the hand, and group 3 (n=23) capillary heel blood sampling for metabolic screening. EEG was recorded from five derivations (F3, F4, Cz, P3 and P4), the infants were videotaped and assessed with the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP). EEG power (µV2) within the theta band (3 to 6 Hz) was calculated, an asymmetry index between right and left frontal activity was derived using natural logarithms. Non-parametric tests were used.Oral Hypertonic Glucose for Analgesia in Preterm NewbornsZ BadieeNeonatologist, Assistant Professor of Pediatrics, Isfahan University of Medical Sciences, Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, IranBackground and AimsA number of studies have shown that orally administered sweet tasting solutions reduce signs of pain during painful procedures in the term newborns. The aim of the present study was to compared the pain reducing effect of orally administered glucose with that of placebo during venipuncture in preterm infants.MethodsA Randomized, double- blind, placebo controlled trial was carried out at the neonatal intensive care unit at the Alzahra Hospital, Isfahan, Iran from June to September 2005. Thirty six preterm newborns (gestational age 28–34 weeks; postnatal age (1–14 days) undergoing venipuncture for clinical purposes, were enrolled in the study. Each infant was assessed two times receiving 1 ml 30% glucose or 1 ml sterile water by mouth, 2 minutes before venipuncture. The behavioral pain reactions were scored with the Premature Infant Pain Profile and duration of crying and heart rate were measured.Changes in Cerebral Oxygenation as Measured by Near-Infrared Spectroscopy During Early Postnatal Adaptation in Newborns Delivered by Vacuum ExtractionT Karen1,2, M Wolf1, R Nef1, D Haensse1, H U Bucher1, G Schulze1, J C Fauchère11Clinic of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switaerland, 2Department of Neonatology, University Children's Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, GermanyBackground and AimsNewborns delivered by vacuum extraction quite often represent a group of infants with a haemodynamic instability. The conventional means to measure the haemodynamic status are not sensitive enough to assess the severity of general, and more specifically of cerebral circulatory imbalance. Near-infrared spectroscopy was used to study cerebral tissue oxygenation during postnatal adaptation in these infants.Methods15 newborn infants delivered by vacuum extraction (group 1) due to fetal distress were enrolled in this study. Immediately after birth and again after 12–24 hours of life, a near-infrared sensor (NIRO-300TM Hamamatsu Japan) was placed over the right forehead of the infant. The tissue haemoglobin index (THI), oxygenation index (TOI), arterial oxygen saturation (pre-ductal tcSaO2) and heart rate (HR) were recorded. Mean values were calculated for the first 0–5, 5–10 and 10–15 minutes and for the measurement at 12–24 hours (median 21 hours) of life and compared by Wilcoxon test to 15 healthy newborns infants delivered by elective caesarean section (group 2).Antenatal Fast MRI in the Prenatal Diagnosis of Fetal MalformationsG Tonni1, P P Pattacini2, C De Felice3, A Ventura11Division of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Guastalla Civil Hospital, AUSL Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy 2Division of Radiology, Guastalla Civil Hospital, AUSL Reggio Emilia, Reggio Emilia, Italy, 3Department of Neonatology, Policlinic Hospital “Le Scotte”, University of Siena, Siena, ItalyBackground and AimsTo evaluate the role of integrating ultrasound with antenatal ultrafast MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) in the prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformations during 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy.Methods2D–3D ultrasound (US) and targeted ultrafast MRI have been used to detect a panel of fetal malformations.Serial Cerebral Blood Flow Profiles of Preterm and Term NeonatesS Abbasi1, K Finnegan, J S GerdesDepartment of Pediatrics, Pennsylvania Hospital, Children's Hospital, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USABackground and AimsCerebral blood flow (CBF) disregulation as measured by Pourcelot's resistive index (RI) is GA dependent and may play a significant role in the development of poor neurologic outcome of infants with intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and hypoxicischemic encephalopathy (HIE). Objective: To generate normal reference data for neonates of different BW and GA, and compare it to those with cerebral pathology.MethodsSpectral Doppler blood flow profiles of the anterior cerebral (ACA) and middle cerebral (MCA) arteries were obtained using an Acuson XP color and Duplex Doppler units with a 5.0/7.5 MHertz specter probe. RI was calculated as (peak systolic velocity-end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic velocity.Endotracheal Suctioning and Cerebral Hemodynamics in NeonatesC Michel1, P Staquet1, M Arsac1, S Marret1, D Eurin2, T Blanc1, V Laudenbach11Department of Neonatal Medicine, Charles Nicolle University Hospital, Rouen, France, 2Department of Pediatric Radiology, Charles Nicolle University Hospital, Rouen, FranceBackground and AimsIn adults under mechanical ventilation, endotracheal suctioning (ES) increases cerebral blood flow (CBF). In neonates, the effects of ES on CBF are poorly described. To evaluate the effects of ES on CBF velocity (CBFV) in ventilated neonates, analyzing the respective influence of i) gestational age and ii) perinatal asphyxia (PA).Methods26 ventilated neonates, born at different term, aged 1 to 48 hours, without sedation, with PA or not (“PA” and “no PA” groups) were prospectively enrolled after parental informed consent. CBFV was measured in the pericalleous artery during 2 successive ES. The primary end point was the variation of the mean velocities (Vm). Results were analyzed with Student T-test or Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.Effects of Different Phases of Surgical Repair of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) on Cerebral Haemodynamics Evaluated by Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)A Dotta, A Braguglia, F Campi, J Rechichi, I Capolupo, S Lozzi, C Corchia, P Bagolan, M OrzalesiDepartment of Medical and Surgical Neonatology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsSurgery for CDH induces a reduction in cerebral blood volume and oxygenation. Our aim was to identify in which phase of the surgical procedure these changes occur preferentially.MethodsFourteen CDH infants were operated at a median age of 3.8 days. Surgery was divided into 3 phases: Removal of viscera from the chest (P1), Closure of diaphragm (P2), Repositioning of viscera into the abdomen (P3). SaO2, Heart Rate and Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MABP) were continuously monitored and, if necessary, FiO2 was adjusted to maintain SaO2 &gt;80%. Changes in Tissue Oxygenation Index (TOI, %) and total cerebral haemoglobin (tHb, mM/l), with respect to initial baseline, were assessed by NIRS. Values obtained at the beginning and at the end of each phase were expressed as means±SD and compared by the Student's t-test for paired values.External Ventricular Drainage with Teflon Screw for Treatment of Rapidly Progressive Posthemorragic Hydrocephalus in Premature NewbornA Franceschi, M Tumolo, G Ottonello, L Nahum, A Moscatelli, S Casanova, G SilvestriDipartimento di Anestesia e Rianimazione Pediatrica, Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Genova, ItalyBackground and AimsThirteen premature newborn, birthweight 1250g (745–1965) with rapidly progressive posthemorragic hydrocephalus were treated by external ventricular drainage with teflon screw. Seven patients suffered from intra ventricular hemorrage grade 3 and six grade 4.MethodsThe drainage was placed at day 8,4+/−2 after intra ventricular hemorrage occurred and was kept in place 33,4+/− 6 days, the longest period being 46 days. Monitoring of intracranial pressure was performed while the drainage was in place.Effectiveness of a Brief Course in Interpreting Amplitude Integrated Electroencephalograms in Term NewbornA Soliz, B Chandler, P Valencia, I Alfonso, E VasconcellosMiami Children's Hospital, Miami, FL, USABackground and AimsRoutine monitoring and interpretation of newborn brain activity using conventional electroencephalogram (EEG) in Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) is difficult. Amplitude-integrated electroencephalogram (aEEG) technology may help NICU personnel evaluate neonatal brain activity in a rapid, non-invasive, and cost-effective manner. Whether NICU personnel could learn to recognize patterns of aEEG/EEG tracings in term newborns after a brief introductory training.MethodsEleven physicians and twenty seven nurses without training in brain monitoring interpretation participated in a pre-test, a brief interactive training course to interpreter neonatal aEEG/EEG patterns, and a follow-up post-course test to interpret these tracings. Twenty five tracings of normal function, brain injury, seizures, and artifacts obtained from a 2 channel aEEG/EEG “Brain Z monitor” were shown to participants. Twelve questions were given pre and post training. Answers were blindly scored. Chi-square was used for statistical analysis.Neuroimaging in Neonatal HypoglycaemiaC Ruiz Serrano1, M Blanco Rodríguez1, R Benítez Fuentes1, M Velázquez De Cuéllar Paracci1, A Leal Orozco1, N Domínguez Garrido1, D Quiñes Tapia2, L Soriano Guillén1, M Bernácer Borja11Department of Pediatrics, Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, Spain, 2Department of Neuroradiology, Fundación Jiménez Díaz, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsNeuroradiological pictures and clinical patterns of two cases of severe neonatal hypoglycaemia: Case 1. A term male three days old with poor feeding in the last 12 hours. He showed signs of dehydration, neurological deterioration and generalized seizures associated with severe hypoglycaemia and metabolic acidosis. Case 2: A term male born by cesarean delivery after an uneventful pregnancy that presented micropenis, respiratory distress and severe hypoglycaemia whenever glucose infusion was reduced or interrupted. Endocrine study revealed multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies.MethodsBrain imaging at 1.5 Tesla consists of saggital T1, axial TSE T2, coronal FLAIR and diffusion. Case 1: the follow-up MRI included 3D T1 and venous MRA. Case 2: the sella was evaluated with high resolution T1 3D.The Efficacy of Brain Ultrasound Examination for Diagnostics of Intrauterine InfectionsN Sapanadze, M Kherkheulidze, N KavlashviliState Medical University, Tbilisi, GeorgiaBackground and AimsIntrauterine infections are one of the main causes of neonatal and infant morbidity and mortality. Early diagnostics and appropriate treatment of these diseases is very important. The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of brain ultrasound examination (BUE) for diagnostics of intrauterine infections.MethodsWe studied 0–3 month's age 150 children with diagnosis of sepsis, perinatal encephalopathy, intracranial hypertension, and prolonged neonatal jaundice. BUE was conducted for every patient and in case of special changes that characterized infections (calzificats, edema, periventricular ishemia, microcysts, and ventriculomegalia) were studied special Ig M and IgG by immunofermental assay. The elevation of specific antibodies more then 4 times in second analyzes comparing to first one was considered as diagnostic criteria of intrauterine infections.The Contribution of Neuroimaging in Neonatal PathologyG C ZaharieDepartment of Neonatology, University of Medicine and Pharmacy ‘Iuliu Hatieganu’, Cluj-Napoca, RomaniaBackground and AimsThe investigation want to reevaluate neuroimaging in newborn infants with neonatal hypoxic pathology.MethodsComplete neurologic examination, EEG, transfontanellar ultrasonography, CT or MRI were carried out in 8 newborns with severe neonatal asphixia 10 days after birth and at the age of 3 months.Sensorial Saturation for Neonatal AnalgesiaC V Bellieni, D M Cordelli, S Perrone, G Buonocore Departments of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproduction Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, ItalyBackground and AimsSensorial Saturation is a procedure in which touch, massage, taste, voice, smell and sight compete with pain, producing almost complete analgesia during heelprick in neonates. SS is an apparently complex manoeuvre, but when correctly explained it is easily learnt. In the present paper we studied its feasibility, assessing whether a long training is really needed to achieve good results.MethodsWe enrolled 66 consecutive babies and divided them randomly into three groups which received the following forms of analgesia: glucose plus sucking (A), sensorial saturation performed by nurses (B); sensorial saturation performed by mothers (C). We did not use perfume on the caregivers’ hands, so that babies could smell the natural scent of the hands. We assessed pain level by the ABC scale.High Prevalence of Vitamin D Deficiency in Newborn Infants of Dark Skinned or Veiled Mothers in the NetherlandsS H Dijkstra1, A Van Beek2, J W Janssen3, L H M de Vleeschouwer2, E L T van den Akker4, W A Huysman11Department of Paediatrics, 2Department of Gynaecology, 3Department of Clinical Chemistry, Sint Franciscus Gasthuis, 4Department of Paediatrics, Erasmus MC- Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsPregnant women with hyper pigmented skin or wearing veils are at risk of vitamin D deficiency. The prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in pregnant women and their newborn infants is unknown. Our aim is to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in newborns of mothers at risk in the Netherlands.MethodsAll pregnant women visiting our outpatient clinic of the obstetric department between April 2004 and February 2006 were encountered to participate in our study. The risk group consisted of women with tinted or dark skin and women wearing veils. The control group consisted of Caucasian women. Information was obtained through a questionnaire about pigmentation of skin, race, sun exposure, dressing habits, use of vitamins and patient history, including clinical symptoms of vitamin D deficiency. Blood samples were collected from the mothers at the end of third trimester. The umbilical cord blood was tested on 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D3, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, calcium and phosphorus, in 87 newborns. Vitamin D deficiency in the newborn was defined as 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 &lt; 25 nmol/l.Postnatal Blood Pressure in Preterm Infants with and Without Histological Chorioamnionitis: A Prospective StudyJ V Been1, N Akinturk1, M Karaduman1, I Rours2, R F Kornelisse2, A J Schneider3, R R de Krijger4, L J Zimmermann11Department of Neonatology, Maastricht University Hospital, 2Department of Pediatrics, 3Department of Obstetrics, 4Department of Pathology, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsChorioamnionitis is an important cause of preterm birth and is associated with major neurological morbidity. We hypothesised that chorioamnionitis in preterm infants is associated with postnatal hypotension, a known etiological factor in the development of neurological morbidity.MethodsOver a two-year period all infants born in the Erasmus MC at ≤32 weeks gestation were included. Relevant clinical data and placental histopathology were obtained from each infant. Blood pressure values were recorded during the first three postnatal days, clustered in four-hour periods, and compared between patients with histological chorioamnionitis (HC) and those without (non-HC).Small for Gestational Age Birth and Risk of Hypertension in Adult Life: Two Unrecognized Children Populations?C De Felice1, M Strambi4, B De Capua2, R Tassi3, D Costantini2, A Del Vecchio5, G Chitano6,7, G Latini5,81Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy, 2Clinical Audiology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy, 3Laboratory of Ultrasonology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy 4Departments of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproductive Medicine, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy, 5Division of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy 6Department of Cardio-Thoracic, University of Pisa, Pisa, Italy, 7Euro Mediterranean Scientific Biomedical Institute (ISBEM), Brindisi, Italy, 8Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Lecce Section, Brindisi, ItalyBackground and AimsEmerging clinical and experimental evidence indicates a link between small size at birth and cardiovascular risk in adult life. The relationship with hypertension remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the physiological day/night variations of blood pressure in two subgroups of children as a function of the posterior communicating arteries (PCoAs).MethodsA total of 26, randomly selected SGA children participated to the study (age, M ± SD: 9.45 ± 2.08 yr). A 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (SpaceLabs 90207) was carried out and the population was subdivided into 2 groups, based on transcranial doppler evidence of bilateral non-functioning PcoAs (PcoA-positive vs. bil-PCoA-negative). Day-to-night variations in systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean (MBP) blood pressure were the main outcome measures.High Plasma Cortisol and ACTH Concentrations in Very-Low-Birth-Weight Infants with Small Thymus at BirthC De Felice1, P Toti4, M Musarò2, L Peruzzi2, P Paffetti2, L Pasqui3, R Magaldi5, M Rinaldi5, G Rinaldi5, G Grilli6, F Bagnoli1, G Latini7,81Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Section of Neonatology, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy 2Pediatric Laboratory, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy, 3Endocrinology Laboratory Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy, 4Department of Human Pathology and Oncology, University of Siena, Siena, Italy, 5Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, Foggia, Italy, 6Radiology Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria, Foggia, Italy, 7Division of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy, 8Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Lecce Section, ItalyBackground and AimsAn acute thymic involution in human fetuses and newborns has been described in very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants with histological chorioamnionitis. However, its underlying mechanisms remain to be clarified. We tested the hypothesis that an activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenals (HPA) axis in VLBW infants with acute thymic involution at birth.Methods107 VLBW newborns (28.7 ± 3.1 wk gestation; 1078 ± 292 g) were examined. Thymic size was measured on standard chest radiographs at birth, and expressed as the ratio between the transverse diameter of the cardiothymic image at the level of the carina (CT) and that of the thorax (T). CT/T&lt; 0.28 was considered to indicate small thymus. Plasma cortisol (Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics) and ACTH (DPC Immunolyte) concentrations were determined on days 1 (d-1) and 7 (d-7), and at 1 month (mo-1).Allergic Diseases and Atopy Up to the Age of 5–7 Years in the Very Low Birthweight InfantsP Kwinta, G Lis, M Klimek, E Cichocka-Jarosz, J J PietrzykDepartment of Pediatrics, Jagiellonian University, Cracow, PolandBackground and AimsFactors present in early life can increase the risk of asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR), and atopic dermatitis (AD). The aim of the study was analysis of the prevalence of wheezing and diagnosis of: asthma, AR, and AD in 5–7 years old very low birthweight infants.Methods108 children with mean birthweight 1090g were evaluated by standardized ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) questionnaire at the age of 5–7 years. Total IgE level, specific IgE, lymphocyte Th1/Th2 ratio and skin prick tests were done. Prevalence of allergic disorders among VLBW infants was compared to ISAAC regional data.Health Utilisation of Very Preterm Infants to Age 4N C Austin1, J Laney2, C Spencer1, D Gray1, T E Inder3, L Woodward41Christchurch Women's Hospital, Christchurch, New Zealand, 2Christchurch School of Medicine, University of Otago, Christchurch, New Zealand, 3Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA, 4Department of Psychology, University of Canterbury, Christchurch, New ZealandBackground and AimsVery preterm infants are known to have ongoing health problems after discharge with respiratory illnesses and neurodevelopmental delay being common. This study examines the health service contacts of a representative regional cohort of very preterm infants to 4 years.MethodsBetween July 1998 and November 2000, 100 preterm babies were recruited and 104 term born control infants were selected when aged 2. General Practitioner (GP), hospital outpatient and admissions from discharge to 4 years were collated and compared.Prenatal Betamethasone Has No Effect on Renal Drug Clearance in the First Month of LifeK Allegaert1, J N van den Anker2, A Debeer1, N H Holford3, G Naulaers1, B Anderson41Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, 2Departments of Paediatrics, Pharmacology and Physiology, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA, 3Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, 4Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Auckland, New ZealandBackground and AimsThere is conflicting evidence on the effect of prenatal betamethasone administration on renal drug clearance [1, 2]. We therefore wanted to document and quantify the impact of betamethasone administration on vancomycin in the first month of life.MethodsPopulation pharmacokinetics of vancomycin in neonates were estimated in a cohort of 214 premature neonates (24–34 weeks) with a postnatal age of 11.9 (1–27) days. Covariate analysis included weight, postmenstrual age (PMA), serum creatinine, use of inotropes, positive blood culture, use of respiratory support, administration of ibuprofen as well as maternal betamethasone administration.Preterm Intrauterine Growth Restriction and Early Postnatal Protein MetabolismR M Reynolds{ur1}, M S Reece1, R E Ridout2, P J Thureen11Department of Pediatrics, University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, The Children's Hospital, Denver, CO, USA, 2Tripler Army Medical Center, Tripler AMC, HI, USABackground and AimsThere is evidence that IUGR fetuses alter in utero nutrient metabolism in order to survive their environment, and this fetal adaptation is associated with long term health disorders. The ability to identify a population of IUGR neonates who demonstrate abnormal protein metabolism would enable an investigation of infant feeding strategies that could ameliorate long-term adverse health outcomes.MethodsThe goal of this study was to determine if preterm infants with definitive IUGR demonstrate abnormal postnatal nitrogen metabolism in the immediate postnatal period when compared to AGA infants of comparable gestational age. All infants received exclusive parenteral nutrition. IUGR infants were pair matched with AGA controls for the following parameters by order of importance to the study outcome: protein intake, gestational age, hours of age at study, energy intake. The primary outcome variable was protein balance as determined by the nitrogen balance method.Perinatal Factors Influencing Later Growth Outcome in Very Preterm InfantsL Maggio, F Gallini, F Cota, F Matronola, S Costa, C RomagnoliNICU, Catholic University, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsPoor growth during the early years is well documented in children born prematurely but the relation between perinatal morbidity and subsequent growth retardation is poorly understood. Our aim was to determine, in children born AGA at GA ≤ 30 weeks, the main perinatal factors predictive of growth patterns at corrected age of 36 months.MethodsThe growth outcome of 133 infants (GA 27.8±1.5 wks, BW 1017±208 g) discharged from ou NICU between 1996 and 2002 was assessed at 36 months of corrected age.

(Preliminary Study)V Soubasi-Griva1, S Petridou1, C Tsantali2, K Mitsakis1, K Gourzioti2, V Drossu-Agakidou111st Department of Neonatology, Hippokration Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, 2Laboratory of 1st Department of Pediatrics, Hippokration Hospital, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, GreeceBackground and AimsThe risks and benefits of prophylactic iron supplementation in pregnant women who are not iron deficient remains a source of controversy. Elevated iron stores during pregnancy have recently been linked to maternal complications and perinatal risks to their offspring (Scholl 2005, Viteri 2005). The aim of this study was to determine if there is an association between maternal iron status, under prophylactic iron supplementation, and perinatalneonatal outcomes.MethodsFull blood count and serum ferritin concentrations were measured at delivery in 42 high risk neonates (IUGR, IDM, prematures) (group A), and 29 healthy term neonates (group B) and their mothers. Serum soluble transferin receptor (TfR) was measured at birth in all neonates. Each group was divided in 3 subgroups according to mothers’ ferritin levels.Salivary Cortisol in Vlbwadolescents Before and after Mental StressE Elsmén1, A K Edstedt Bonamy2, M Norman2, L Hellström-Westas11Department of Pediatrics, Institution of Clinical Sciences, Lund University, Lund, Sweden, 2Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsLow neonatal plasma cortisol is associated with morbidity in very preterm infants. Later, other studies show increased salivary cortisol responses in such infants, and children born preterm are at risk for higher blood pressure. The aim was to investigate salivary cortisol responses and blood pressure in adolescents born preterm before and after MRI, a potentially stressful situation.MethodsForty-nine adolescents, age 12–17 years, born preterm (birth weight &lt; 1500g) and 43 controls born at term, age 12–16 years. Salivary cortisol was measured before and after MRI. Subjects also answered a validated questionnaire, including 12 items, about perceived stress.

The influence on this variability of DR-CPR has not been investigated. The objective was to analyze if the LOS in ELBW is different in those who received DR-CPR compared to those who died but did not require DR-CPR.MethodsAnalysis of all ELBW who died and had been born at two Emory perinatal centers in the last 5 years. Exclusion criteria were major congenital malformations and provision of comfort care. DR-CPR was defined as chest compression and/or epinephrine use in the delivery room (DR).Nasogastric Tube Position in NICU ChildrenJ de Boer, B J SmitDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Erasmus MC — Sophia, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn the NICU, nasogastric tube placement is an essential procedure that is considered relatively safe. In adult patients however, tube placement errors are common, with tubes being positioned in the esophagus, the intestines, and the respiratory tract. Incidentally even perforations into the pleural space are mentioned. Errors may occur both during insertion and due to migration over time. In neonates only few studies on tube placement were performed. Improper positions were mentioned in 38% to 55% of cases (Weibley et al., 1987). With regard to patient safety, these are alarming numbers. To establish the validity of these figures for our own NICU, we conducted a retrospective study of tube position on X-rays in a one-year patient cohort.MethodsThe first available X-ray from all NICU patients with visible nasogastric tube position admitted through 2005 was reviewed. Trained medical students categorized them according to previously set decision rules as ‘correct’, ‘incorrect’ or ‘ub-optimal’ (in the stomach but excessively long).Should Very Preterm Babies be Given Hydrocortisone at Birth?M Watkinson, C RoseNeonatal Unit, Birmingham Heartlands Hospital, Birmingham, UKBackground and AimsTo measure the incidence of early (first 24 hours of life) hypotension in very preterm (&lt; 27 weeks) infants.

Consequently the treatment of extremely premature infants is contentious and health professionals’ views may vary, with possible implications for both clinical practice and infant outcomes. This study aims to use qualitative methods to investigate health professionals’ attitudes to the care of extremely premature infants.MethodsSemi-structured interviews were conducted with UK health professionals involved in the care of extremely premature infants. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and subjected to theme analysis.The Care of Premature Infants at the end of the XIX CenturyA Martín1, E Ponsell1, P Ferrer De Sant Jordi1, V Ferrer21Dpt. de Enfermería y Fisioterapia, UIB, Palma de Mallorca, Spain, 2Dpt. de Psicología, UIB, Palma de Mallorca, SpainBackground and AimsThe care of premature infants is a matter of a great importance and of considerable interest during the last two centuries. In 1898 premature births ranged from 15 to 30 per cent of all births in Europe and in USA. The aim of this paper is to describe the recommendations published in some scientific articles about the care of premature infants at the end of the XIX century in Europe.MethodsThe recommendations written in these three articles: Incubators and milk laboratory feeding (1897); the care and feeding of premature infants (1898) and The care of premature and feeble infants (1898) have been analyzed.Longitudinal, Normative end Tidal Carbon Monoxide Measurements in Preterm NeonatesF A Camfferman1, C A Blok1, T G Krediet1, H J Vreman2, R Marges1, D K Stevenson2, F van Bel11Department of Neonatology, University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatal and Developmental Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA, USABackground and AimsEnd-tidal carbon monoxide production, corrected for ambient CO (ETCOc), is associated with severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) in premature infants and may be used in the prediction of chronic lung disease. In term infants ETCOc measurements are validated as parameter for hemolytic disease. However, normal values for ETCOc among preterm infants are not available. To obtain these, we measured ETCOc in term and preterm infants during the first week of life and compared these with ETCOc during hemolysis.MethodsUsing the COCO2 Puff End-Tidal Breath Analyzer (Everest Biomed Instr, Chesterfield, MO) ETCOc (ppm) was measured in healthy preterm and term infants from non-smoking mothers, at days 1, 3, 5 and 7, together with serum bilirubin and hematocrit (Ht).Medication Errors in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (UCIN): The Effect of its Registration on the Drug Error RateA Campino Villegas, I Lopez de Heredia I Goya, M C Lopez Herrera, M Garcia Franco, A Valls I SolerNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, Department of Paediatrics, Hospital de Cruces, Barakaldo, Bizkaia, SpainBackground and AimsMedication errors occur in relation to the many steps involved in the process of drug use in neonates. To err is human, so errors should not be considered as punishable acts, but rather there causes should be analysed to prevent new incidents. We aim to report the effect on the error rate of the simple review and registration of medication use, before a specific preventive strategy was implemented.MethodsDeviations from drug use related to legibility, dose, units, route of administration, and dosing intervals were prospectively registered in a level III regional NICU. The study was planed in three steps: a pilot phase (n=122 drug prescriptions and their transcriptions by nurses) to know the incidence of errors; a full phase (n=4,182 observations) before any intervention was implemented, and a final one to measure the effect of the preventives on error rate. We report the results of the first two phases.Methods of Measurement of Glucosuria in NewbornsJ Bekhof, C Deiman, B Kollen, H L M van StraatenAmalia Department of Pediatrics/Neonatology, Isala Clinics, Zwolle, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn newborns measurement of glucosuria by means of a visually readabile teststrip (glucostick) is a frequently used test. The newborn's urine can be collected by putting a piece of cloth in the diaper. After compression of the wetted cloth urine can be evacuated with a syringe and subsequently applicated to the teststrip (dripstick method). Alternatively teststrips are frequently interpreted after pressing the strip in a wet diaper for a few seconds (diaperstick method). The aim of this study was to compare both methods in measuring glucosuria.MethodsIn 47 premature newborns 201 urinesamples ere tested both with the diaperstickmethod and the dripstickmethod. Two different manufacturers were used: Multistick (Bayer) and Combur3Test (Roche). Results of both type of strips are categorized as 0, +, ++, +++ or ++++, in ascending degree of glucosuria. All samples were interpreted by the same investigator.Metabolic Bone Disease in Preterm Infants: Comparison Between Quantitative Ultrasound in Bones and Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA)J C Fauchere1, T Karen1,4, K Huerzeler1, S Das-Kundu1, H U Bucher1, G Goerres3, D Uebelhart21Clinic of Neonatology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 2Clinic of Rheumatology, Osteoporosis Centre, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 3Division of Nuclear Medicine, Department of Radiology, University Hospital Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland, 4Department of Neonatology, University Children's Hospital Tuebingen, Tuebingen, GermanyBackground and AimsFetal bone accumulation in calcium and phosphorus occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy. Thus, preterm infants, and specially those undergoing intensive care and thereby periods of non optimal nutrition are at risk of osteopenia. Measuring the speed of ultrasound (SOS) in bones is a promising, bed-side and radiation-free means of assessing bone mineralization with the potential to replace the current bone-mineral density assessment techniques which produce ionizing radiation.MethodsSOS was measured using the Sunlight Omnisense Premier 7000® (mean of 3 cycles) in the right tibial cortex of premature infants born before 32 wks gestation at 4 weeks of age. Bone mineral content (BMC; g) and bone mineral density (BMD; g/cm2) were determined the same day by the DEXA ODR-1500 Hologic® with integrated Infant Whole Body software.Mitochondrial Energy Generating System in Critically Ill NeonatesJ Zeman, T Honzik, H Hansikova, L Wenchich, M Pejcnochova, M Magner, M Zapadlo, R PlavkaDepartment of Paediatrics and Neonatology, Faculty of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech RepublicBackground and AimsInadequate capacity of energy production due to delayed biosynthesis and proper assembly of respiratory chain complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane may play an important role in the neonatal morbidity, especially in very premature neonates.MethodsThe activities and amount of respiratory chain (RC) complexes and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) were analyzed in isolated muscle mitochondria obtained at autopsy in 19 premature neonates using spectrophotometric and radioenzymatic methods, Western blotting and Blue-native electrophoresis. Two groups of children recommended to muscle biopsy at the age of 0.5–2 and 3–18 years served as controls.Asymmetric Dimethylarginine and Neonatal AdaptationG Vida1, E Sulyok2, T Ertl1, J Martens-Lobenhoffer3, S Bode-Böger31Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary, 2Institute of Health Promotion and Family Health, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pécs, Pécs, Hungary 3Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Magdeburg, Magdeburg, GermanyBackground and AimsRecent evidences suggested that elevated plasma asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels can be regarded as a marker of endothelial dysfunction that mediates cardiovascular morbidity. It may have a role in the cardiopulmonary adaptation of the neonate. The present study was undertaken to investigate the perinatal NO metabolism by measuring l-arginine, ADMA, and symmetrical dimethylarginine (SDMA) in cord blood, and in peripheral plasma of the neonate.MethodsTen newborn infants of healthy mothers were selected for the study. The mean birth weight and gestational age of the newborn infants were 3330 g and 39.6 weeks (ranges 2560–4070 g and 39–40 weeks), respectively. Blood samples were taken from the umbilical vein and artery, and by venepuncture on the second day of life into tubes in ice water containing EDTA. Plasma concentrations of l-arginine, ADMA and SDMA were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method.Assessment of Preterm at Termadjusted age and Full-Term Infants Bone Status with Quantitative UltrasoundP Roggero, P Piemontese, M L Giannì, A Orsi, O Amato, V Puricelli, S Montella, F MoscaNICU, Clinica Mangiagalli (IRCCS), University of Milan, Milan, ItalyBackground and AimsPreterm infants (PT) have an increased risk of low bone mass. Ultrasound velocity [speed of sound (SOS)] has been proposed as a non invasive, non ionizing and portable method of evaluation of bone status. Several observations in PT at birth show a significantly lower SOS than in term infants (FT). To compare SOS of PT assessed at term adjusted age to SOS of FT assessed within 72 hours of life.Methods29 PT (13 males; mean gestational age (GA) 31.2 wk; mean birth weight (BW) 1361 g±329; and 82 FT infants (46 males; mean BW 3218 g±418) at birth. Body length (BL) was measured to the nearest 0,1 cm on a Harpenden neonatometer (Holtain Ltd, UK) and knee-heel length (TL) was measured using a heel-knee caliper (Chasmors Ltd, UK). Bone status was evaluated in the midpoint of the right tibia by quantitative ultrasound (CS probe), Sunlight Omnisense (Sunlight Medical Ltd, Israel) and expressed as the mean of three SOS values assessed by the same operator.Continuous Insulin Infusion in Extremely-Low-Birth-Weight Newborns under 26 weeks of Gestational AgeM Berces, E Polonkai, Z Horvath, N Katona, T Kovacs, B Kovacs-Paszthy, J Kovacs, G BallaDepartment of Obstetrics, Division of Neonatology, University of Debrecen, Debrecen, HungaryBackground and AimsTo provide normal glucose homeostasis for extremely immature newborns at the early postnatal age represents a significant therapeutic goal for the neonatal intensive care team. Physiologic blood glucose levels and metabolism are critical factors for disease-free survival. We were seeking early clinical and laboratory signs which could detect or predict disturbances of glucose metabolism and indication for insulin treatment.MethodsIn a retrospective analysis we studied 169 extremely immature newborns with post menstrual gestational age less than 26 weeks. Continuous insulin infusion was initiated for those who developed hyperglycemia, hyperkalemia. Each day of the first two weeks of life insulin-, glucose intake were recorded besides the parameters of ventilation therapy, blood gas, ion values, glucose-, lactate concentrations, temperature support, and other vital signs, treatments.Neonatal Screening for Congenital Hypothyreoidism (NSCH), Phenylketonuria (Nspku) and Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (NSCAH): Four Year DataZ Gucev1, A Jancevska1, G Jovanov2, A Sisko2, A Trenevska2, L Tasevska-Rmus1, B Taseva1, V Vankovska11Department of Endocrinology, Pediatric Clinic, Medical Faculty Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia 2Health Center Skopje, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsImportance of performing neonatal screening programs for congenital hypothyreoidism, phenylketonuria and congenital adrenal hyperplasia for Macedonian children.MethodsNSCH was introduced in the Republic of Macedonia in April 2002. 51200 newborns from the Republic (exceptions Skopje and Bitola with children screened in the neighboring pediatric laboratory) were screened. For 10 months NSPKU and NSCAH also functioned and 28600 children were screened for PKU, 9258 for CAH. A new design of the filter paper and instructions were applied. Education was organized in the delivery wards throughout Macedonia. A central laboratory was set out and links with a reference laboratory were established. Blood was collected (days 2–5 after birth) on filter paper and enzymatically assayed for TSH, phenylalanine and 17 hydroxy progesterone.Excess of Iodine During the Neonatal Period: Be Careful, Even Very Little May be too MuchS Ares1, M Saenz De Pipaon1, G Morreale De Escobar2, J Quero11Neonatology Unit, University Hospital La Paz, Madrid, Spain, 2Department of Molecular Endocrinology, Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas Alberto Sols, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsThere are several causes for alterations of thyroid function. Quite prominent are iodine deficiency during the perinatal period, and exposure to an iodine excess, caused by iodine-containing antiseptics (10,000 µg of iodine /mL) and radiologic contrast media (250–370 mg of iodine /mL). The aim is to bring to the attention, that even a minor iodine-overload may impair thyroid function during a period of development when thyroid hormones are very important for the brain.MethodsThyroid function and iodine excretion were analysed at different postnatal ages.Management of Neonatal Hyperglycaemia: Glucose Restriction is Still in Vogue!A L Mukherjee1, V Kairamkonda1, M Khashu1, A Grover21Department of Neonatology, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester, UK, 2Department of Paediatrics, Northampton General Hospital, Northampton, UKBackground and AimsAlthough hyperglycaemia is a common problem in VLBW infants, there is a lack of consensus with regard to its management. We investigated current practice regarding management of neonatal hyperglycaemia across the UK. Our aim was to ascertain the working definition and management strategy of neonatal hyperglycaemia in major neonatal units across the UK.MethodsSurvey questionnaire was emailed to consultants working in units with &gt;6 NICU cots.Extraordinarily Rapid Descent of non Palpable Testes at Birth — A Prospective Study on 5250 Live Male NewbornsM Barak1,2, F Mimouni1,2, I Berger1,2, S Dollberg1,2, D Mandel1,21Department of Neonatology, Sourasky Tel Aviv Medical Center, Lis Maternity Hospital, Tel Aviv, Israel 2Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv, IsraelBackground and AimsCryptorchidism occurs in 2–5% of full term boys at birth. Because an undescended testis may represent an atrophic or vanishing testis, it has been suggested to use ultrasonography or even MRI to verify its presence. The objective of this study was to evaluate the rate of testicular descent in full term infants with at least 1 non palpable testes at birth.Methods5250 male infants were checked during a period of 14 months. Infants with non palpable unilateral or bilateral testis at the first examination, were reexamined daily until their discharge (day 2–3 of life) and weekly thereafter until the age of 2 weeks. Premature infants delivered before 37 weeks of gestation or those with additional genital anomalies were excluded form the study.Dried Whole Blood Spots Spectrophotometry in Newborns with Congenital HypothyroidismC De Felice1, M Musarò2, L Peruzzi2, A Barducci3,4, P Corrocher5, G Latini6,7, R Casini81Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy, 2Laboratory of Pediatric Endocrinology, Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproductive Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, Italy, 3Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara”, National Research Council of Italy, Florence, Italy, 4Department of Information Engineering, University of Siena, Siena, Italy, 5IntexSystem, Prato, Italy, 6Division of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy, 7Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Lecce Section, Italy, 8Te&amp;Co, Prato, ItalyBackground and AimsEarly diagnosis and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism (CH) (∼ 1/3000–1/4000 live births) prevent severe mental retardation in affected patients. Only ∼5% of the CH infants are detected by clinical criteria before the results of the T4/TSH population screening. As anemia is a frequent finding in CH and depends on the degree of hypothyroidism, we tested the hypothesis of a decreased reflectance in the red section of the visible spectrum on blood spots from CH newborns.MethodsSpectrophotometry on filter paper-adsorbed dried blood spots was performed for 16 CH newborns and 322 matched control newborns. Coordinates in the standard CIE-L*a*b* and L*C*H* space colors and spectral reflectance curves were obtained (portable spectrophotometer; 400–700 nm wavelengths range; standard D65 illuminant) and computed by a color software package (Colormedica, IntexSystem). Accuracy of spectrophotometry in identifying CH samples was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.Influence of Early Hyperglycemia to Clinical Course and Outcome in Preterm InfantsC A Lee, Y S Wee, E K Yoo, K H LeeDepartment of Pediatrics, Pochon CHA University, Bundang CHA General Hospital, Sungnam, Kyunggi, South KoreaBackground and AimsWe can find the hyperglycemia at the condition of acute illness easily. There is a report that hyperglycemia cause the increase of morbidity and mortality of many diseases. The purpose of this study is to know how can the hyperglycemia influence to the preterm infants 48 hours after be born.MethodsA retrospective chart review for 77 premature infants who were admitted to Pochun CHA University neonatal intensive care unit between January 2002 and March 2005 was done. They are all less than gestational age 30 weeks. Infants were divided into two groups depending upon their glucose level. One is the hyperglycemia infants group whose glucose level is at least one time more than 150mg/dL (n=38), the other is the non-hyperglycemia infants group whose glucose level is less than 150mg/dL (n=39).Organochlorine Compounds and Docosahexaenoic Acid During Prenatal ExposureC Campoy1, I Machado1, M Jimenez2, A Abril1, M F Olea-Serrano3, M Parrilla1, N Olea21Department of Paediatrics, School of Medicine, University of Granada, Granada, Spain, 2Department of Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, University of Granada, Granada, Spain, 3Department of Nutrition and Bromatology, University of Granada, Granada, SpainBackground and AimsThe present study examines the relationship between the prenatal exposure to Organochlorine Compounds (OCs) and their bioaccumulate in fatty tissues with the LC-PUFA n3 plasma concentrations.Methods72 Spanish mother-baby pairs were analysed. Plasma phospholipids n-3 and n-6 PUFAs (in mg/dl) and OCs (in ng/ml) were obtained in mother's and neonates’ plasma using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.

Meconium, a highly viscous substance, causes small airway obstruction leading to airtrapping and atelectasis, in addition to effects of local inflammation. Meconium contains gastrointestinal secretions, cellular debris and proinflammatory factors. DNA could contribute to the viscosity of meconium, analogous to the situation in sputum in cystic fibrosis patients. RhDNase treatment of these patients induces mucolysis and improves airway patency. Meconiumlysis based on DNA degradation may create new therapeutic approaches in newborns with MAS. We hypothesized that rhDNase decreases meconium viscosity.MethodsSterile meconium samples were incubated with rhDNase or PBS as control. Final concentrations of substrate varied from 250 to 1000 microgram per gram meconium. Viscosity was measured with the CAP 2000 viscometer. For each sample, the arithmetic mean of three measurements was calculated.Glutathione Fractional Synthesis Rates in Preterm InfantsF W J te Braake1, H Schierbeek2, K de Groof1, A Vermes3, J B van Goudoever11Department of Paediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Paediatrics, Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands 3Hospital Pharmacy, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsOxidative stress is associated with severe complications of prematurity, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, periventricular leukomalacia, and necrotising enterocolitis. Glutathione is the major intracellular antioxidant with a mean fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of 65% in healthy adults [Lyons, 2000]. The FSR reflects the fraction that is renewed per unit of time. Our aim was to determine the FSR of glutathione in preterm infants, receiving only glucose, on the second postnatal day.MethodsPreterm infants with a birth weight &lt;1000 gram were given a primed continuous infusion of [1–13C]glycine. Blood was sampled after 4, 5, and 6 hours. [1–13C]glycine incorporated in glutathione was measured with liquid chromatography — istope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS). As a precursor for glutathione synthesis, intracellular free [1–13C]glycine enrichment was measured with gas chromatography — IRMS.Risk Factors for Growth Failure in Very Low Birth Weight InfantsR C Silveira, M G Oliveira, R S ProcianoyDepartment of Pediatrics, Newborn Section, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, Porto Alegre, RS, BrazilBackground and AimsSome VLBW infants present growth retardation in infancy. Aim: Evaluate risk factors for growth failure at 1 year corrected age of newborns with birth weight ≤ 1500 grams.MethodsA cohort of newborns with birth weight ≤ 1500 grams admitted between 11/2003 to 12/2004 was followed up to 12 months corrected age. Weight, length and head circumference were plotted on NCHS curves. The group was divided in relation to Z score: &lt;2 SD and ≥ 2 SD. Birth weight, gestational age, adequacy to gestational age, length of hospital stay, maternal education, hospital readmission were compared between both groups. Birth weight ≤ 750 grams, presence of PIVH and/or PVL, clinical sepsis and maternal education ≤ 9 years were also analyzed.Effects of Early Enteral Nutrition on Very Low Birthweight (VLBW) and Extremely Low Birthweight (ELBW) InfantsF M Tandoi, C Negri, G Calciolari, L Leva, P Battaini, P Rancan, M AgostiU.O. Nido, Neonatologia e Terapia Intensiva Neonatale/Ospedale ‘Filippo del Ponte’, Varese, ItalyBackground and AimsAdvantages of early enteral nutrition on preterm infants are widely described in literature. In the year 2000, in our unit, we started to introduced nutritional guidelines, to promote enteral nutrition in VLBW and ELBW. Aim of the study is to verify the effects of nutritional changes on several clinical indicators, confronting 1998–99 and 2003–04 periods.MethodsAll ELBW (group A) and VLBW (group B) infants consecutively admitted to our NICU in the two-years period of 1998–99 — newborn under older nutritional guidelines — and 2003–04 — implemented guidelines — were included in the study. Significant changes of policies regarded introduction of human milk bank, schedule for increasing enteral nutrition and management of feeding intolerance. A comparison between the two year-periods was performed inside both groups A and B. Between two-year periods, as clinical indicators, we analyzed: Days under parenteral nutrition, (total and partial), regaining of birthweight, type of feeding at discharge, growth patterns during hospitalization (average growth) and at discharge (weight, length and head circumference), days of hospitalization, incidence of surgical necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). For statistical purposes we used the c-square test, Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney test.Secondary Copper Deficiency as a Differential Diagnosis of Severe Osteopenia in a VLBW Infant with Multiple Pathological FracturesB Wiebe1, C H Fremerey1, U Pohlmann1, M Ehlen1, P Bartmann21Department of Neonatology and Paediatric Intensive Care, Asklepios Klinik St. Augustin, St. Augustin, Germany, 2Department of Neonatology, University of Bonn, Bonn, GermanyBackground and AimsCopper, through its role as a cofactor for lysyl oxidase is essential for cross-links in collagen and elastin. Studies in copper deficient animals demonstrated that impaired mechanical strength was related to defects in the collagen component of the bone thus facilitating pathological fracturing of the bone.MethodsWe report on a female preterm infant of 25th week of gestation with multiple spontaneous fractures most probably due to alimentary copper deficiency.Perinatal Morbidity of Fullterm Newborns with Intrauterine Growth RestrictionB Mihajlovic-Dimovska, M Kalajdzieva-Zip, V Delovska-Stojkova, J Guleva, T PensovskaDepartment of Neonatology, Special Hospital of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsNewborns with intrauterine growth restriction, because of placental insufitiention and chronic hypoxia, have high risk for asphyxia and other pathological conditions. Aim of the study is to establish perinatal morbidity of full term IUGR babies, by analysis of frequency of perinatal asphyxia, meconium aspiration syndroma (MAS) and hypooxicishemic encephalopathy (HIE).Methods3190 liveborn have been analysed in the study, born in 2004, in SHGO-Cair, Skopje.

In order to determine the causes of refractory SE as well as to evaluate the effectiveness of treatment protocols, we studied retrorpectively the files of patients admitted to our PICU with the diagnosis of SE in a 3 years period.MethodsDuring the last 3 years, 44 patients were admitted to our PICU with SE, a number that reflects 10% of total admissions. Thirty four (78%) of these patients were transported sedated and incubated from other hospitals. Midazolam was the main anesthetic agent used. Effectiveness of treatment was confirmed by clinical criteria and continuous EEG monitoring.Posterior Cranial Fossa TumorM C Espinheira, S Soares, M Guardiano, A Maia, C Rego, M J Gil da Costa, M M Campos, J E GuimarãesDepartament of Pediatrics, Hospital São João, Porto, PortugalBackground and AimsThe eradication of congenital syphilis has remained an elusive goal of public health policy. Wordwide, syphilis remains as a significant cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Neurosyphilis is believed to occur in 60 percent of these infants. Neurosyphilis is a pleomorphic disease, causing clinical pictures that occasionally mimic other better known neurological diseases.MethodsThe authors present a clinical case of a six year-old girl, brought to the emergency department complaining of headaches, balance disturbances, dysarthria and vomiting, that evolved for the course of three weeks. Initial cerebral computerized tomography scan showed a posterior cranial fossa lesion, with mass effect.Management of Refractory Convulsive Status Epilepticus in the Pediatric Intensive Care UnitE Vasilaki, A M Spanaki, E Mihailoudi, D Fitroulaki, G BriassoulisPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital of Heraklion, Heraklion, Crete, GreeceBackground and AimsThe optimal treatment of refractory convulsive status epilepticus (RCSE) has not been defined. The aim of our study was to determine the characteristics and treatment modalities in the management of RCSE in a PICU.MethodsNineteen children with RCSE are described. The incidence was 2.7% of total admissions in a five year period and the age at the onset ranged between 40 days and 14 years (12 girls, 7 boys). Clinical characteristics and treatment algorithms were correlated with the need for mechanical ventilation (MV), length of stay (LOS) and length of MV (LOMV).Application of Eeg Monitoring in PicuM Kotsiou, A Violaki, H Volakli, M Sdouga, E Kontopoulos, M TamiolakiPICU, Hippokration Hospital, Thessaloniki, GreeceBackground and AimsThe use of continuous EEG monitoring has been proposed for evaluation of increased ICP, ischemic events, level of sedation, status epilepticus, non convulsive seizures, metabolic disorders, intracerebral tumors and all etiologies of coma. We present the use of continuous EEG monitoring with the Infinity Express EEG pod, Siemens SC 9000 XL monitor in the assessment of treatment results in patients with status epilepticus treated in our PICU.MethodsContinuous EEG monitoring was applied in 8 patients aged from 2 months to 9 years admitted in our ICU during the last two years. Status epilepticus was the main symptom in all patients and the underlying disease was encephalitis in 2 patients, metabolic disorder in 1, hypoxic encephalopathy in 1, sepsis in 1 and in 3 patients no profound etiology was found. All patients needed sedation and mechanical ventilation.Adequacy of Finapres Technology for Detecting Blood Pressure Changes in ChildrenJ Lemson1, C M Hofhuizen1, A E A Hemelaar1, S K Singh2, O Schraa3, G J Scheffer41Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 2Department of Thoracic Surgery, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, 3BMEYE, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 4Department of Anesthesiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsFinapres technology allows for continuous non-invasive measurement of finger blood pressure and has proven to be accurate in adults. A prototype pediatric device (PFINAP) has been developed and accuracy in children has been demonstrated in an earlier study. Aim of this study was to assess the adequacy of PFINAP in detecting blood pressure changes in children.MethodsFifteen anesthetized children with a median age of 11 months (2 months – 7 years) and a median body weight of 10 kg (4 – 31) undergoing congenital cardiac surgery were included in the study. PFINAP and intra arterial blood pressure (IAP) were recorded simultaneously during the procedure. The four largest IAP variations within a 5 minute interval were identified from each procedure. Afterwards, PFINAP was compared with IAP for these blood pressure changes.Feasibility of Pulse Contour Cardiac Output in Critically Ill ChildrenJ Lemson, A E A Hemelaar, H N M van de Sant-van Alst, J G van der HoevenDepartment of Intensive Care Medicine, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsCardiac output (CO) measurement in critically ill children is cumbersome, but may improve hemodynamic management. Following a primary calibration, arterial pulse contour cardiac output (PCCO) provides a fast and accurate beat-to-beat measurement of CO in adults with special relevance to changes in CO. Aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of PCCO in critically ill small children.MethodsWe prospectively studied 13 mechanically ventilated and sedated children with a median age of 2.3 years (2 months – 8 years) in our paediatric intensive care unit. Transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) with ice cold saline was considered clinical gold standard. Measurements were performed using the PiCCOplus system with software version 6 (Pulsion Medical Systems) incorporating both PCCO and TPTD techniques. PCCO and TPTD were recorded simultaneously and relative changes were compared at various intervals.Relationship Between BNP Values and Clinical Severity Indicators After Pediatric Cardiac SurgeryJ C López-Menchero1, A Alcaraz1, C Romero2, P Aparicio3, M Camino3, R Greco4, M M Santos1, E Maroto31Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain 2Department of Clinical Chemistry, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain 3Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain 4Department of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, SpainBackground and AimsThe few studies conducted in children suggest that BNP could be a useful biomarker in the diagnosis and follow-up of cardiac function after surgery. The aim of the present study was to measure BNP in children undergoing cardiac surgery and to evaluate its relationship with their clinical outcome.MethodsProspective observational study in 55 consecutive patients admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after cardiac surgery. BNP levels were determined by an inmunochemiluminiscent assay (ADVIA Centaur, Bayer) at four different times: before surgery (T0) and on first, second and third day after surgery (T1, T2, T3). BNP concentrations were examined in relation to: mean duration of PICU stay (MS), days on mechanical ventilation (MV), inotropic score (IS) (μgr/Kg/min dopamine x1+dobutamine x1+epinephrine x100) and worst PELOD score (PS) at 24, 48 and 72 hours following surgery. Data are shown as median (P25–P75), differences were assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test and correlation between variables by Spearman rank correlation test.Longitudinal Study of Blood Pressure and Baroreflex Sensitivity in Pediatric Oncologic PatientsH Hrstková1, N Honzíková2, B Fiser2, Z Nováková2, E Z⇑odn↞su2}, J St'astná111st Department of Paediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic 2Department of Physiology, Faculty of Medicine, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech RepublicBackground and AimsThe aim of the present study was the analysis of blood pressure regulation in children and adolescents after treatment with cardiotoxic antracyclines for oncological diseases.MethodsThirty one subjects treated with antracycline (A) and 11 subjects treated with different drugs (nonA) were investigated twice (interval between investigations from 1 to 9 years) in the range between 1 and 18 years after the treatment. Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) was determined from 5 minutes beat-to-beat recording of systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and inter-beat intervals (IBI). The values of all these parameters were compared with the values obtained by the identical method in 339 healthy children and adolescents (N). Because the investigated subjects were of different age the measured values were normalized for age 16 years by linear regression and only normalized values were further analyzed.Superior Vena Cava Flow in Healthy Term InfantsA Lee1, E Nestaas1,2, D Fugelseth1, L Brunvand11Barneintensiv Avdeling, Barnesenteret, Ullevål Universitetssykehus, Oslo, Norway, 2Barneavdelingen, Sykehuset Vestfold HF-Tønsberg, Tønsberg, NorwayBackground and AimsThe risk of impaired neurodevelopmental outcome remains a challenge in the treatment of very premature infants. Disturbances of cerebral blood flow play an important role in the pathogenesis of intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia. A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) may cause hypoperfusion of the immature brain. Kluckow et al. have shown that systemic blood flow can be estimated by measuring flow in the superior vena cava (SVC). The aim of this study was to gather experience with this method, and to investigate the relation between ductal flow and SVC-flow in healthy term infants.MethodsHealthy term infants were enrolled consecutively during spring 2005 and underwent echocardiographic investigation on the first, second and third day of life. SVC-flow was measured according to the method of Kluckow et al.High Frequency Oscillatory Ventilation Does Not Impair Cardiac Output in Infants with Isolated Respiratory FailureJ Brierley, T Thiruchelvam, M PetersPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsThe impact of the higher mean airway pressure (MAP) during high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV) compared to conventional ventilation on haemodynamics remains uncertain. HFOV may decrease right ventricular venous return due to higher intrathoracic pressures or lost respiratory muscle pump. Newer non-invasive techniques allow accurate haemodynamics in smaller children than previously possible. We hypothesised HFOV would have no significant impact on Cardiac Output (CO) expressed-Cardiac Index=CO/body surface area (CI) or Blood Pressure (BP).MethodsTen isolated respiratory failure infants had baseline haemodynamic assessment before HFOV and after 1 and 5 mins of HFOV using continuous wave non-invasive Doppler ultrasound. (USCOM). Diagnoses: 6 RSV, 1 metapneumovirus, 1 adenovirus and 2 pneumococcal pneumonia. No volume administered or inotropes (all &lt; 5mcg/kg/min dopamine) altered during study.The Role of PRO B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Early Diagnosis and Predicting Outcome of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Premature NeonatesA F El-Khuffash1, M Ambruso2, M Culliton2, J Loyta3, K Walsh4, EJ Molloy11Department of Paediatrics, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, 2Department of Biochemistry, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland 3Department of Biostatistics, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, 4Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsB-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and pro-atrial natriuretic (pro-BNP) are both secreted by the atrium in response to volume loading. BNP is useful in predicting the magnitude of shunting through a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) in premature neonates. We hypothesized that pro-BNP may be useful in the early diagnosis of a PDA and in monitoring treatment response.MethodsPreterm neonates with weights &lt;1500g and &lt;/=30 weeks underwent an echocardiogram on day 1 and day 3 of life coupled with a pro-BNP assay. Neonates who did not have a PDA underwent a repeat echo and BNP measurement on day 5. In patients who received treatment for a PDA, an echo and BNP were repeated 48 hours after completion of treatment.The Role of Left Ventricular Output in Maintaining Adequate Systemic Perfusion in the Presence and Absence of a Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Premature InfantsA F EL-Khuffash1, J Loyta{au2}, K Walsh3, EJ Molloy11Department of Paediatrics, National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland, 2Department of Biostatistics, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, 3Department of Paediatric Cardiology, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsPatent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) is a significant cause of morbidity in premature neonates. We aim to assess the significance of LVO in maintaining good perfusion in the descending aorta (DAo) and the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) in premature neonates and demonstrate the negative impact of a PDA on systemic blood flow in the setting of poor LVO.MethodsPremature neonates less than 1500g were included in this prospective observational study. Echocardiographic evaluation was carried out on days 1, 3 and 5 of life. In neonates requiring treatment of PDA, a further echo was carried out to confirm closure. LVO, systolic and mean velocities of the SMA and DAo were measured.Diuresis Following Indomethacin Treatment in Preterm Infants with Persistent Ductus Arteriosus is Dependent on Fluid Intake Before TreatmentC M Lameijer, M van Stuijvenberg, A F BosDepartment of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, University Medical Center, Groningen, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIndomethacin treatment leads to a transient decline in diuresis in many preterm infants. Administration of cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors to hypovolaemic patients bears a significant risk of renal failure. The severity of side-effects following indomethacin treatment in preterm infants might be influenced by fluid management. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between fluid intake before and diuresis following indomethacin treatment for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA).MethodsWe retrospectively studied all preterm infants born in 2004 and admitted to the NICU, University Medical Centre Groningen, who were treated with indomethacin for PDA. Fluid intake and diuresis were determined on a daily basis, from 2 days before indomethacin treatment up to 5 days after treatment.Pertussis Requiring Intensive CareJ Surridge1, E R Segedin1, C C Grant2,31Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand, 2Department of General Paediatrics, Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand, 3Department of Paediatrics, University of Auckland, Auckland, New ZealandBackground and AimsSevere pertussis in young infants remains difficult to treat. Pertussis is prevalent in New Zealand and thus many infants are hospitalised with severe pertussis. The study aims were to describe children with pertussis who required intensive care.MethodsAn audit in Auckland, New Zealand, of all pertussis admissions to the national paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) 1991–2003.Autologues Fibrin Glue Use after TonsillectomyN Cekic1, K Georgievski1, R Filipovski1, O Zografski2, K Cekic Dimovska31ENT Unit, Military Hospital, Skopje, Macedonia, 2ENT Unit, MC Veles, Skopje, Macedonia, 3PO Pinokio, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsThe aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of autologues fibrin glue use after tonsillectomy.MethodsTwo groups of patients underwent tonsillectomy in endotracheal anesthesia. All patients were previously tested on coagulation status/disorders. In all 22 patients of the first group, immediately after tonsillectomy, tonsillar fossae were filled up with autologues fibrin glue with 4% Lidocaine. Three of the patients had some coagulation disorders (extended protrombine time or extended partial trombine time). In 20 patients of second group, mono or bipolar electrocutter to stop bleeding, was used.Surfactant in an Infant with Aspiration SyndromeM Bisceglia1, M Piccirillo2, F Tancioni2, M Verre21Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Crotone Hospital, Crotone, Italy, 2Intensive Care Unit, Hospital S. Giovanni di Dio, Crotone, ItalyBackground and AimsAfter impressive results in the treatment of respiratory failure in preterm infants, naturl surfactant has been proposed in lung pathologies involving suspected surfactant deficiency: bronchiolitis, pneumonia, aspiration and chest trauma, which can lead to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).MethodsA.D., an 18 months-old infant, had febrile seizure and loss of conscience. At the admission he was connected to the ventilator limiting tindal volume of less than 8ml/kg; fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 0.6; peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) of less then 36 mm mmHg, ventilation rate of 36 b/min. The chest x ray was characterized by aspiration syndrome and pneumotorax. The severe respiratory distress and the ventilatory parameters led us to consider the use of surfactant. We supply surfactant by intratracheal instillation at the dose of 0.5ml/kg (CUROSURF).Incontinentio Pigmenti with Glaucoma, Retinal Ablation and Retrobulbar Mass in a Six Year Old Girl (Case Report)G Jovanov1, K Damovska2, V Tasic2, A Jancevska2, Z S Gucev21Health Center Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia, 2Medical Faculty Skopje, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsDescription of patient with incontinentio pigmenti and eye complications (glaucoma, retinal ablation and retrobulbar mass).MethodsSix year old girl with incontinentio pigmenti, neonatal diagnosed and eye complications. The diagnoses was performed by clinical signs and laboratory methods dermal biopsy, EKG, X-rays of chest, ultrasound, MRI and genetic analyses).Fatal Stroke and Multiorgan Failure as Sudden Onset of a Mitochondrial Disease in a Young InfantM Benedetti, M Soffiati, P Santuz, C Ghizzi, M Bolognani, P Bonetti, F Zaglia, S Marzini, P BibanPaediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Major City Hospital, Azienda Ospedaliera di Verona, Verona, ItalyBackground and AimsMELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) is a fairly common metabolic syndrome characterised by various clinical manifestations. The majority of patients with MELAS are adults younger than 40 years. A relatively small number of diagnoses have been confirmed on the basis of muscle biopsy in childhood, while diagnosis is rarely performed in infancy. We describe a young infant with an abrupt and fatal onset of MELAS.MethodsThe subject was a 4-month female infant, born at term by consanguineous parents. The neonatal period was uneventful. Family history revealed a sister who died at 2 years of age with MELAS and respiratory failure. Muscle biopsy showed multiple enzymatic deficits of respiratory chain complexes (I, II, III, IV and citrate synthase).Haemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis and Paediatric Intensive Care AdmissionsO Kapellou, P ListerPICU, Great Ormond Street Hospital NHS Trust, London, UKBackground and AimsHaemophagocytic Lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare cause of Multi Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS). Our data of patients with HLH admitted to intensive care from January 1993 to January 2001 showed poor outcome, despite treatment, with 15 out of 16 children dying due to multiorgan failure. Recently an overall survival of 58.5% was reported after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We wanted to review outcomes over the last 5 years and compare to the earlier period.MethodsRetrospective review of the medical records of children admitted to PICU with HLH from February 2001 to March 2006.Utility of Oesophageal Doppler Monitoring in Fluid Management in Paediatric Septic ShockR Chhabra, P Maheshwari, A Desai, S Nadel, D P InwaldPICU, St Mary's Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsTo determine the utility of oesophageal Doppler monitoring in the assessment and management of fluid status in paediatric septic shock.Methods8 patients with inotrope-dependent septic shock were studied, with a median age of 12 months (range 6 months–2 years) and weight of 10 kg (5–12 kg). A KDP72 oesophageal Doppler probe (Deltex Medical, UK) was inserted. Stroke volume and cardiac output were calculated from aortic blood flow velocity using nomograms based on age, weight and height. Flow time corrected for heart rate (FTc), which provides an index of preload, was also measured. The patients received 16 boluses of 4.5% albumin solution (10mls/kg) prescribed on the basis of decreased FTc, indicative of hypovolaemia. Heart rate (HR, bpm), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP, mmHg), lactate (mmol/l), cardiac index (CI, l/min/m2) and FTc (ms) were recorded before and after the fluid bolus. Inotropic support remained unchanged between paired measurements.National Paediatric Intensive Care Activity (UK) 1998 – 2003 As Recorded by the Hospital Episode Statistics DatabaseH Livingston, S M WhiteleyPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, St James's University Hospital, Leeds, UKBackground and AimsThe hospital episode statistics database 1 (HES) provides information on all inpatients admitted to NHS hospitals in England from 1989 onwards. We examined the data held in relation to PICU admissions, to identify trends in activity and PICU outcome.MethodsA search strategy was devised to identify the number of admissions to general paediatric intensive care units for the period 1998–2003. The data was stratified for age, mode of original admission to both hospital and PICU (acute/elective), source of admission to PICU and mortality.Diagnostic Role of Proinflamatory Cytokines, C-Reactive Protein and Procalcitonin in Pediatric Neutropenic Fever PatientsI Devrim1, G Seçeer1, T Kutluk2, M Ceyhan1, A Kara1, H Tezer1, A K Uludağ3, A B Cengiz11Pediatric Infectious Disease Unit, 2Pediatric Oncology Unit, 3Department of Biostatics, Hacettepe University, Faculty of Medicine, Ankara, TurkeyBackground and AimsA reliable highly spesific and sensitive marker which could be helpful in neutropenic fever is needed. This study was planned to evaluate the diagnostic value of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), procalcitonin (PCT), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in pediatric neutropenic fever patients with documented infection and no documented infections (FUO).MethodsWe have evaluated the diagnostic value of the parameters in determining the infection and optimum time to collect samples in febrile episodes of 20 different neutropenic patients.Late Onset Sepsis in VLBW Infants: Role of CarotenoidsD van Zoeren-Grobben1, A Vogelsang1, R A Van Lingen1, J Slootstra2, A Schaafsma31Department of Neonatology, Isala Clinics, Zwolle, The Netherlands, 2Department of Clinical Chemistry, Isala Clinics, Zwolle, The Netherlands, 3Friesland Foods, Leeuwarden, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsIn vitro studies have shown that carotenoids are antioxidants and immune modulators. VLBW infants may be deficient in carotenoids since carotenoids are not present in total parenteral nutrition (TPN), the main feeding source of these infants in the first week of life. We studied the role of carotenoids as antioxidants and have shown that low beta-carotene intake and plasma levels are associated with an increased incidence of BPD. In this study we evaluated the role of carotenoids as immune modulators and studied whether carotenoid levels are related to the occurrence of late onset sepsis (LOS).MethodsPlasma concentrations of α- and β-carotene, lycopene, lutein, vitamin A and the vitamin E/cholesterol ratio were studied at days 1, 3, 7 and 21 in a group of 109 preterm infants: 76 control, 33 with LOS. LOS was defined as clinical or culture proven sepsis &gt; 3 days of age.Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis and Serum Leptin in Healthy Infants in the First Year of Life: Relation to the Kind of Early FeedingF Savino, S A Liguori, M F Fissore, E C Grassino, C Guidi, E Palumeri, R Oggero, R MinieroDepartment of Pediatrics, “Regina Margherita” Children's Hospital, Torino, ItalyBackground and AimsBioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) estimates body composition through the measurement of resistance (R), reactance (Xc) and phase angle (PA). R is high in adipose tissue, Xc and PA are indicators of body cellular mass. Leptin, mainly synthesized by the adipose tissue, is also produced by mammary epithelial cells and secreted into breast milk. We studied the relationships between serum leptin concentration and BIA measurements in infants in the first year of life according to the kind of early feeding.MethodsWe studied 90 healthy term infants aged 0–12 months, 48 exclusively breast fed (BF) for at least 4 months and 42 formula fed (FF). Serum leptin concentration was determined by RIA test; BIA was performed by a single-frequency, phase-sensitive impedance analyser.TH1Þ2 Lymphocytes Response During the Course of Lung Infection in CF ChildrenL A Jelenina1, A V Orlov2, T Bulgakova1, T S Ses21State Medical Pediatrician Academy, Saint-Petersburg, Russia, 2Institute of Pulmonology, Saint-Petersburg, RussiaBackground and AimsCystic Fibrosis (CF) — is characterized by early airway inflammation and recurrent respiratory infections.

The hope that interrupting puberty might increase adult height has led to the thought of using combined treatment in girls with Turner syndrome (TS) and spontaneous puberty (SP).MethodsThree girls with TS and SP were involved. They started treatment with GH at the age of diagnosis (4.5, 10.0, 10.0 years). All of them entered puberty spontaneously at the age of 10.9, 11.0 and 10.2 years respectively. After the confirmation of their pubertal onset with LHRH stimulation test, GnRH analogue treatment was added. Auxological and pubertal development were evaluated at 3–6 months intervals. Bone age (BA) was also determined using the Greulich and Pyle method. The special CDC TS-charts were used.Evaluation of Ten Steps for Successful Breast-Feeding in Valiasr Hospital in Kurmshahr Iran 2004S Nouhjah1, M Mojadam21Department of Public Health, School of Health Medical Sciences, University of Joundishapoor, Ahwaz, Iran 2Province Health Center, Ahwaz, IranBackground and AimsThe baby friendly hospital intiative is considered one of the most successful international efforts ever performed to protect, promote and support breast feeding.

The major cerebral lesions in these infants are of circulatory origin and pulsed and color Doppler evaluation has become an important tool for studying cerebral hemodynamics. To aim for minimal handling of the premature infants, we wanted to investigate whether measuring blood flow velocity toward or away from the transducer probe gave equal blood flow velocity (BFV) estimates within the same vessel, thus enabling us to measure both middle cerebral arteries (MCA's) from one side only.MethodsUsing an 8.5 Hz probe BFV was measured in the right and left MCA by placing the probe over the respective temporal template. In addition to the flow estimates of the ipsilateral vessel, we also obtained the negative BFV estimate of the contra lateral vessel (flow away from the probe). The same procedure was repeated from the opposite side and ultimately the two separate estimates were compared. The order of left and right was chosen randomly.Immunological Features of Human Milk in Different EthniaL Ciardelli1, F Garofoli1, M A Avanzini1, A De Silvestri2, A Serra3, A Gasparoni4, M Stronati31Research Laboratories, Neonatal Immunology and Paediatric Oncohematology, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy, 2Biometric Unit, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy, 3Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, Italy, 4Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Spedali Civili, Brescia, ItalyBackground and AimsTo evaluate immunological secretory memory, we studied production of s-IgA specific for E. coli (Anti-Ec-s-IgA) in mothers’ milk of different ethnia previously exposed to poor conditions, but living in Italy in adequate conditions.

This is imperative in critical care transport where trainees work in foreign, exposed environments. Consequently, critical examination of practice is essential. This study evaluates the effect of reflective practice on a group of paediatric critical care trainees during an attachment to a specialised retrieval service.MethodsTrainees already maintained a mandatory logbook of their retrievals. After receiving instruction and on-going support, trainees recorded retrievals as episodes of reflection over an 8-month. The impact on trainees was gauged using semi-structured questionnaires and interviews. These techniques also explored factors that facilitated or hindered reflective practice.Efficacy of Ciprofloxacin in an Experimental Model of Escherichia Coli Chorioamnionitis in RabbitsE Launay1, N Joram1, C Jacqueline2, J Caillon2, J C Roze1, C Gras-Le Guen11Pediatric Intensive Care, CHU, Nantes, France2UPRES EA 3826, School of Medicine, Nantes, FranceBackground and AimsChorioamnionitis is a purulent infection causing prematurity, neonatal sepsis and death. Usual treatment (β-lactams and aminoglycosides) is not optimal with the persistence of foetal bacteremia. So we studied the efficacy of ciprofloxacin, active in pus and not used in this indication, in a rabbit model of chorioamnionitis.Methods12 h after the intrauterine inoculation of E. coli, 6 pregnant rabbits were treated with ciprofloxacin (30mg/kg IV), 6 with ciprofloxacin + gentamicin (10mg/kg IM) and 4 others were untreated (controls). At 12, 36 and 60 h after inoculation, caesarian was performed. The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by the foetal survival, maternal and foetal blood cultures and tissular and amniotic liquid cultures.Insulin Resistance in Children with Meningococcal Sepsis: Does it Occur?J J Verhoeven, A C S Hokken-Koelega, M den Brinker, K F M JoostenDepartment of Pediatric Intensive Care, Erasmus MC Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsHyperglycemia (glucose &gt; 8 mmol/l) in critically ill children with various diseases is associated with increased mortality. It is not known whether insulin therapy will be beneficial and which children should be treated. The objective was to investigate the occurrence of insulin resistance by analyzing blood glucose levels in relation with insulin levels in children with meningococcal sepsis.MethodsProspective observational study. In all children with meningococcal sepsis on the pediatric intensive care between October 1997 and May 2004 blood levels of glucose and insulin were analyzed on admission and related with glucose intake and corticosteroid use.Effect of Betamethasone on Cerebral Blood Flow Velocities in Preterm Neonates With Severe Bronchopulmonary DysplasiaG Cambonie, O Pidoux, R Mesnage, C Milesi, M Badr, P Plan, E Sabatier, B Veit, F Montoya, J C PicaudNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, Arnaud de Villeneuve Hospital, University Hospital of Montpellier, FranceBackground and AimsIn fetal sheep, betamethasone administration in late gestation exerts a major vasoconstrictor effect on cerebral blood flow. In human preterm infants, postnatal corticosteroids are associated with an increased risk of neurodevelopmental delay, but little is known about the haemodynamic involvement in the occurrence of cerebral injury. We aimed to assess the effects on cerebral blood flow velocities (CBFV) of betamethasone (BM) given to premature infants for the treatment of exceptionally severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (ESBPD).MethodsWe prospectively measured CBFV in subjects treated with BM for ESBPD and lifethreatening conditions. BM dosage was 0.5-0.5-0.5-0.3-0.3-0.1 mg/kg/d. After standardization of the procedure, CBFV were recorded in the anterior cerebral (ACA) and the lenticulostriate arteries (LSA) before and 2 hours after each dose of BM. Results expressed as mean (SEM) and analyzed using repeated-measure ANOVAs.Delayed Neural Conduction in the Auditory Brainstem in Preterm Infants With Chronic Lung DiseaseZ D Jiang, D M Brosi, A R WilkinsonDepartment of Pediatrics, University of Oxford, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UKBackground and AimsNeonatal chronic lung disease (CLD) is known to affect growth and development of the immature brain. However, it is not known whether infants with neonatal CLD are at risk of auditory deficits. This study aims to detect functional abnormality in the auditory brainstem at term in preterm infants with CLD.MethodsWe recruited 25 preterm infants who suffered neonatal CLD, with gestational age 23–30 wks. None had any concomitant other major perinatal problems. At 37–42 wks postconceptional age, brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) was recorded with clicks of 21–91/s.Pilot Study Using Niro-200 in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) Infants to Assess Cerebral AutoregulationA C Doolan, A R TwomeyNational Maternity Hospital, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsNear Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRO) uses light spectroscopy, to provide us with information about oxygenation within the tissues, measuring changes in the concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin (Hb02), deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb), total haemoglobin (HbT), tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and tissue haemoglobin index (THI), thus giving us information about brain oxygenation, cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow.MethodsThe aim was to observe if infants &lt;1.5kg demonstrated evidence of cerebral autoregulation in response to position changes. A total of 12 VLBW babies were observed on Day 1, 2 and 3. The NIRO-200 (Hamamatsu) was used to record Hb02, HHb, HbT, TOI and THI. The changes in these variables in response to the tilt and changes in vital signs were recorded. Infants with a CRIB score of 6+ were considered separately to those who were assigned a score of 5 or less.Ultrasound Diagnosis of Hypoxicischemic Encephalopathy in NewbornsB A BurovTashkent Medical Institute of Postgraduate Education, Tashkent, UzbekistanBackground and AimsHypoxic-ischemic damages of the brain in newborns is the significant current problem of neonatology. The lesions of the nervous system account for 50% in the structure of the pediatric disability. The diseases of nervous system are related to perinatal factors in 70–80%.MethodsNeurological symptoms do not always reflect the character and severity degree of the central nervous system damage, and so ultrasound diagnosis has the important role in the identification of these pathologies. Neurosonography is one of the current methods of ultrasound diagnosis of encephalopathy.Outcome of Infants Excluded from A Hypothermia Trial by Amplitude-Eeg (aEEG)J D Barks1, D V Azzopardi2, S M Donn11Department of Pediatrics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, USA, 2Department of Paediatrics, Imperial College, London, UKBackground and AimsInfants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) were excluded from a recent hypothermia trial if an analog aEEG (Lectromed) tracing failed to meet criteria for moderate-to-severe abnormality. Expertly interpreted aEEG is predictive of outcome of HIE; yet, its prognostic utility by novice or infrequent users is uncertain.MethodsCases were ascertained from the recruitment log from a single study center. 25 infants &gt;=36 wks with birth depression and moderate-to-severe HIE in the first 5.5h of life were logged over 2 years. 12 were randomized, 1 was ineligible because of equipment malfunction, and 12 did not meet aEEG criteria.Glutathione Fractional Synthesis Rates in Neonates With Perinatal AsphyxiaK de Groof1, F W J Te Braake1, H Schierbeek2, J B Van Goudoever11Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pediatrics, Division of Neonatology, Mass Spectrometry Laboratory, Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsPerinatal asphyxia is one of the major causes of neonatal death. During hypoxia, reactive oxygen species are formed by reperfusion and by resuscitation with 100% oxygen. Reactive oxygen species cause brain injury and organ failure. Glutathione (GSH) is the major intracellular antioxidant. It protects cells against the toxic effects of these reactive oxygen species. The fractional synthesis rate (FSR) of glutathione in healthy adults is 65 ± 13%/day [Lyons, 2000]. Our aim is to quantify the FSR of glutathione in term asphyxiated infants, shortly after birth.MethodsNeonates with a gestational age &gt; 35 weeks, umbilical pH &lt; 7.10 and 5 min Apgar score &lt; 7 were included. To quantify glutathione synthesis, we infused [1–13C]glycine between 48 and 96 hours after the hypoxic event. Blood was sampled after 4, 5 and 6 hours. Free [1–13C]glycine enrichment was measured by gas chromatography — isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) and was used as a precursor for glutathione synthesis. Labelled glycine incorporation in glutathione was measured by liquid chromatography — IRMS.Breathing Xenon While Cold is CoolC E Hobbs1, J J Dingley1,2, A M Tucker1, M Thoresen11Department of Child Health, CSSB, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK, 2Department of Anaesthetics, Morriston Hospital, Swansea, UKBackground and AimsHypothermia (HT), administered after hypoxia-ischaemia (HI) in newborn infants, is neuroprotective. However, the long-term efficacy is uncertain and the number to treat is 6. Experimental models show that the inert gas Xenon (Xe) protects the brain after HI. Preliminary work combining the two treatments to enhance neuroprotection shows great promise. Xe has a high density and viscosity, and at high concentration (70%) can cause respiratory depression. Moderate Xe concentration (50%) does not depress respiration at normothermia (NT) but the effect of the combination on respiration in neonates is unknown. Thus, our aim was to examine the respiratory effects of 50% Xe and HT after HI in the neonatal rat.Methods29, 7-day-old (P7) Wistar rats underwent ligation of the left common carotid artery, followed by 90 minutes of hypoxia (8% oxygen) at NT. Pups were then randomised to receive 5h of: Air/NT, Air/HT, 50% Xe/NT or 50% Xe/HT. Sampling of blood gases was performed immediately after the treatment period.Is Vigintiphobia Remerging? Biochemical Markers of Neurotoxicity Due to Hyperbilirubinemia in NeonatesC Turkyilmaz1, N Okumus1, E E Onal1, Y Atalay1, A Serdaroglu2, G Deda5, Y K Kemaloglu3, H Pasaoglu4, S Elbeg4, A Cansu2, B Gunduz31Department of Neonatology, Gazi University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey, 2Department of Pediatric Neurology, Gazi University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey, 3Department of Otorhinolaryngology, Gazi University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey 4Department of Medical Biochemistry, Gazi University Medical Faculty, Ankara, Turkey, 5Department of Pediatric Neurology, Ankara University Medical Faculty, Ankara, TurkeyBackground and AimsThe aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between serum levels of S-100 and Tau protein and bilirubin encephalopathy findings in neonates.MethodsSixty one jaundiced and 28 healthy term newborns were included. Serum levels of S-100 and Tau protein were analysed by ELISA. Neurological examination, Electroencephalogram (EEG), otoacustic emission (OAE), brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) were done in infants on admission and at the age of three months.Perinatal Changes of Neurotrophins in Intrauterine Growth Restricted and Appropriate for Gestational Age Term Offspring and Their MothersK E Nikolaou, A Malamitsi-Puchner, E Economou, M Boutsikou, T Boutsikou, K P Puchner, M Kyriakakou, D Hassiakos2nd Department Obstetrics and Gynecology, Athens University, Medical School, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsIntrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) are fetuses with estimated weight &lt;10th customized centile, displaying signs of chronic malnutrition and hypoxia, possibly leading to brain sparing effect. Neurotrophins, [Nerve Growth Factor (NGF), Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), Neurotrophin-4 (NT-4)] are important for pre- and postnatal brain development. This study investigated circulating levels of NGF, BDNF, NT-3 and NT-4 in IUGR and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) term fetuses and neonates and their mothers.MethodsBDNF, NGF, NT-4, NT-3 were determined by enzyme immunoassays in the plasma of 60 mothers (MS) and their 30 IUGR and 30 AGA fetuses (UC) and neonates on postnatal day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4).Effect of Hgh on Brain Antioxidant System and Lipid Peroxidation of Hypoxic-Ischemic Newborn RatsH Yildizdas1, M Satar1, N Canacankatan2, E Tutak1, N Narli1, Y Sertdemir31Department of NICU, Çukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, Turkey, 2Department of Biochemistry, Çukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, Turkey, 3Department of Biostatistics, Çukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, TurkeyBackground and AimsWe investigated the effect of hGH on newborn rat brain superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels in hypoxic-ischemic newborn rats.MethodsForty-eight 7 days old newborn rats were randomised to healthy (n:15), hypoxic ischemic (H-I, n:18) and GH administered hypoxic ischemic (GH-HI, n:15) group. Permanent, left common carotid ligation was performed in the hypoxic ischemic groups. In the GH-HI group, 50 mg/kg s.c. hGH was administered just before carotid artery ligation. After 2 hours of hypoxemia rats were decapitated. Right and left cerebral hemispheres (CHs) and cerebellum-brain stem (C-BS) were separated.Neonatal Brain Injury — Hypoxia Plus Infection. Which is the Outcome?M Craiu, A V Cochino, P AvramInstitute for Mother and Child Care, Bucharest, RomaniaBackground and AimsAs stated in literature, the association between hypoxia and infection is a worsening factor of neonatal brain injury. We performed a 2 years study, to determine the value of the risk increment in this concern.MethodsThis is a retrospective case control study. The data were gathered from clinical files of 2004–2005. The infected group: 11 newborns with documented infection and hypoxic/ischemic brain damage. The control group: 27 newborns with perinatal brain damage. We have evaluated the risk factor distribution, especially the infection, and the severity of neurologic impairment, as documented by clinical and transfontanelar echographic (TFE) evaluation.Leptin Receptor Expression in the Brain of Newborn Rats Decreases Following Hyperoxia and Increases After Injury Caused by PhorbolesterC Peiser, P Koehne, M Dzietko, O Polley, M Obladen, U Felderhoff-MüserDepartment of Neonatology, Charité Virchow-Campus, Berlin, GermanyBackground and AimsLeptin is a pleitropic proteohormone and cytokine, which acts by binding at the long isoform of the leptin receptor (OB-Rb). Next to metabolic and immunomodulating functions, leptin also promotes angiogenesis, takes part in brain development, and plays a role in neuroprotection. The aim of this study was to investigate OB-Rb expression in the brain of newborn rats in relation to neurodegeneration, either induced by hyperoxic or inflammatory brain injury, both important causes of neonatral neurodegeneration.Methods6 d old Wistar rat pups were either subjected to 80% oxygen or treated with phorbolester by injecting 500 μg intraperitoneally. After 0, 2, 6, 12 and 24 h of exposition animals (n = 5 per group) were sacrificed and the brain cortices were processed for molecular experiments on mRNA (quantitative RT-PCR) and protein (Western blot) levels using OB-Rb specific primers and antibodies.Lateral Ventricular Size in Extremely Premature Infants: 3D Mri Confirms 2D Ultrasound MeasurementsS Horsch1, J Bengtsson2, A Nordell2, Z Nagy2, B Hallberg1, H Lagercrantz1, U Ådén2, B Nordell2, M Blennow11Department of Neonatology, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Department of Hospital Physics and MR Centrum, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsCerebral ventriculomegaly at term equivalent age is an predictor of adverse outcome in preterms. It can easily be detected with cranial ultrasound (US), whereas 3D MRI provides a valid assessment of ventricle volumes. Previous studies have found limited correlations between 2D ventricular US measurements and 3D MRI volumes; however CSF volumes were not subdivided into extracerebral and ventricular CSF.MethodsPaired cranial MRI and US scans in a population based cohort of 43 ELGA infants were obtained. Infants were scanned at term equivalent age on a 1.5T MRI system. To segment the lateral ventricles, an image processing software was developed using a semiautomatic Active Contour model. Cranial US was performed in the coronal and parasagittal planes through the anterior fontanelle. Five different ventricular dimensions were measured on each side.The Effect of Changes in Cerebral Perfusion Pressure (Cpp) on Amplitude Integrated Eeg (aEEG) in A Neonatal Piglet Model of Intraventricular HaemorrhageK Aquilina1,2, A M Tucker1, C E Hobbs1, M Thoresen11Clinical Science at South Bristol, St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, UK, 2Department of Neurosurgery, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol, UKBackground and AimsaEEG is an important tool in the evaluation of neonatal brain activity and prediction of outcome. Changes in aEEG related to changes in CPP were studied.MethodsFive piglets (&lt;24 hours old) were anaesthetised. Four mls of high hematocrit blood were injected into the lateral ventricles over two hours (1), under continuous intracranial pressure (ICP), invasive mean arterial pressure (MAP) and aEEG monitoring. Post-injection ultrasonography confirmed the intraventricular location of the injected blood.The Effect of Intraventricular Hemorrhage on Simultaneously Recorded Two-Channel Aeeg in Newborn Rat PupsA M Tucker, C E Hobbs, K Aquilina, M ThoresenDept of Child Health (CSSB), University of Bristol, UKBackground and AimsIntraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is associated with a high incidence of disability or mortality, particularly in cases involving posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (hydrocephalus). Amplitude-integrated EEG (aEEG) allows continuous monitoring of cerebral activity and is a strong predictor of neurodevelopmental outcome. Analysis of simultaneously-recorded aEEG during and after IVH may elucidate the effect of IVH on brain function, including the occurrence of seizures.MethodsUsing our IVH model (Cherian, 2003), 80-μL of citrated rat blood was infused into alternate lateral ventricles of 12, anaesthetized Wistar rat pups on postnatal day (P) 7 and P8. Continuous, two-channel aEEG (BRM2, BrainZ Instruments Ltd, NZ) was recorded from each hemisphere; before (baseline), during and after the infusion of blood, until the needle was removed. The aEEG recording was made on both days of the blood injection (P7 and P8).Effect of Chronic Fetal Hypoxia on Chicken Embryo Surfactant MaturationJ V Been, B Zoer, L J Zimmermann, N Kloosterboer, C G Kessels, E Villamor, J F van IwaardenDepartment of Neonatology, Maastricht University Hospital, Maastricht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThe processes of pulmonary growth and maturation are critical in preparing the fetus for postnatal life. Previous studies suggest a modulatory effect of prenatal hypoxia on lung development. We hypothesise that normal surfactant development is altered by chronic prenatal hypoxia in the chicken fetus.MethodsWhite Leghorn fertilised eggs were incubated at either room air or 15% hypoxia from day 6 of the 21-day incubation period. Normoxic and hypoxic chick embryos were sacrificed at either day 16 (n=15 for each group) or day 19 (n=15 for each group). Lungs were excised and total protein was measured in the homogenate. After butanol extraction, total phospholipids (PL) and disaturated phospholipids (DSPL) were measured. Surfactant protein B (SP-B) was measured by ELISA.Maternal Pulse Oximetry Perfusion Index and Adverse Neonatal Respiratory Outcome After Elective Caesarean DeliveryC De Felice1, L Leoni2, E Tommasini2, O Pede2, G Tonni3, A Del Vecchio4, G Ladisa4, G Latini4,51Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Policlinico “Le Scotte”, Siena Italy, 2Department of Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Policlinico “Le Scotte”, Siena, Italy, 3Division of Obstetrics, Guastalla Hospital, Reggio Emilia, Italy, 4Division of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy 5Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Lecce, ItalyBackground and AimsNo reliable maternal predictors of adverse neonatal outcome at ELCS are known to date.MethodsThe value of maternal pulse oximetry [perfusion index (PI), pulse rate (PR), and oximetry (SpO2)] monitoring during the elective cesarean section (ELCS) in identifying newborns with adverse respiratory outcome was assessed in a prospective casecontrol study. ELCS was sub-divided into 9 phases. Analysis of pulse oximetry-derived signals, systolic (sys-BP), diastolic (dia-BP) and differential (diff-BP) blood pressure were recorded during the ELCS in 44 healthy mothers as a function of neonatal morbidity. Maternal arterial and newborn cord blood gas analysis and placental histology were performed.Pulmonary Endostatin Perinatally and in Lung Injury of the Newborn InfantJ Janér1, S Andersson1, C Haglund2, P Lassus31Hospital for Children and Adolescents, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, 2Department of Surgery, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, 3Department of Plastic Surgery, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, FinlandBackground and AimsEndostatin (ES) is a potent angiogenesis inhibitor. Angiogenesis is central for the development of the human lung. The role of ES in the development of the human lung and connection to chronic lung disease remains unclear. We set out to study the role of ES in the developing human lung, and in acute and chronic lung injury in the preterm infant.Methods9 fetuses, 14 control neonates without primary lung disease, 14 preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome, and 8 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia were included in the immunohistochemistry study. Tracheal aspirate fluid samples of intubated very low birth weight infants during postnatal weeks 1–5 were analyzed with ELISA.Algorithm for Ecmo (Extracorporal Membrane Oxygenation) in Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (Cdh) — Changes Over 15 YearsS T Hien1, F Loersch1, J Sartoris1, S Demirakca1, V Varnholt1, S Loff2, T Schaible11Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Pediatric Hospital, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany 2Pediatric Surgery Unit, University of Mannheim, Mannheim, GermanyBackground and AimsECMO is a lifesaving intervention, its role on CDH survival is still controversial. We examined the relationship between ECMO and its effect on CDH survival in our NICU over 15 years (1991–2005).MethodsIn 15 years, our NICU received 280 patients with CDH. For evaluation and interpretation of different management protocols, this period was divided into 3 periods: The unit received 38 patients with CDH (19 ECMO) in 1991–1995, 58 (29) in 1996–2000 and 184 (88) in 2001–2005.Diagnostic Criteria and Molecular Mechanisms of Abca3 DeficiencyO Danhaive1,2, D Peca2, S Petrini3, R Boldrini4, J Rechichi1, F Savignoni1, A Gallo5, C Corchia11Division of Neonatology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy, 2Laboratory of Neonatal Biology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy, 3Division of Molecular Medicine, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy, 4Division of Clinical Pathology, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, Italy, 5Laboratory of RNA Editing, Bambino Gesù Children's Hospital, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsMutations in the ABCA3 gene are associated with neonatal and pediatric lung disease. However, clinical and histological phenotypes vary widely. Our aim was to identify diagnostic criteria for ABCA3 deficiency.Methods6 neonates with progressive unexplained respiratory failure underwent lung biopsy. Standard staining and immunohistochemestry for SpB, proSpB, proSpC were performed on formalin-fixed/paraffinembedded sections. Electron microscopy was done with lead citrate/uranyl acetate contrast and after immunogold staining. ABCA3, SpB and SpC coding exons were sequenced on PCR-amplified genomic DNA from patients’ leukocytes; when possible, gene transcription (mRNA) was measured by real-time RTPCR on lung tissue and protein expression by immunofluorescence on frozen lung sections.A Risk Index to Predict the RDS Occurrence in Neonates from Mothers with Intrahepatic Cholestasis of PregnancyD De Luca1, M Marras1, G Barbato1, T Bernardini2, C Romagnoli1, E Zecca11NICU, Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Catholic University of The Sacred Heart, Rome, Italy, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Catholic University of The Sacred Heart, Rome, ItalyBackground and AimsIntrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) has an incidence ranging from 0.1% to 1.5% of pregnancies in Europe. We recently demonstrated that ICP is significantly associated with the occurrence of RDS in the newborn but we failed to find a direct correlation between maternal or neonatal BA levels and the RDS occurrence. We looked for a scoring system able to predict the occurrence of neonatal RDS in infants from ICP mothers.MethodsWe reviewed our database about 70 pregnancies complicated by ICP from 2000 to 2003 and we elaborated a risk index which includes factors significantly related to the RDS occurrence in the multivariate analysis: exposure time to abnormal maternal BA levels (ET), maternal BA levels at delivery and gestational age (GA). RDS risk index = BA (µmol/l) x ET (days) / GA (days). The risk index was then prospectively verified in 30 neonates born from ICP pregnancies in 2004–2005.Higher IL-10 in Cord Blood of Premature Infants with RDS But Not BPDJ Y Kim1, J Y Park1, S J Cho1, Y J Kim2, E A Park11Department of Pediatrics, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea, 2Department of Obstetrics, Ewha Womans University College of Medicine, Seoul, South KoreaBackground and AimsRDS and BPD are characterized by inflammation, destruction and repair in the premature lung. We hypothesized that the cord blood levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10, proinflammatory IL-12, and the balance between the two cytokines related to Th1 response and IFN-gamma production would be useful in predicting the occurrence of RDS and BPD in premature babies.MethodsCord blood samples from 56 premature infants born at Ewha Womans University Mok Dong Hospital from January 2003 to June 2005 were studied after prior parental consent at mid pregnancy. Cord blood of infants with maternal history of chorioamnionitis, maternal infections, and major congenital anomalies were excluded. The cord blood were stored in -70 and IL-10 and IL-12 levels were measured with ELISA. A retrospective study of the medical records was performed for clinical data.Clinical Significance of Plasma B-Type Natriuretic Peptide in Respiratory Distress Syndrome of the NeonateG Rocha1, F Clemente2, T Rodrigues3, H Guimarães41Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de São João, Porto, Portugal, 2Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de São João, Porto, Portugal, 3Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Department of Epidemiology, Faculty of Medicine of Porto University, Porto, Portugal, 4Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de São João e Faculty of Medicine of Porto University, Porto, PortugalBackground and AimsPlasma brain-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is secret by cardiac ventricular myocytes in response to pressure or volume overload. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the severity of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and plasma levels of NT pro-BNP.MethodsPlasma levels of NT pro-BNP were measured in premature neonates (&lt; 34 wks gestation), at 24 hours (day 1), 7, 14 and 21 days of life and in 18 term neonates without RDS and congenital heart disease at 24 hours of life. Levels of NT pro-BNP were compared between premature neonates with and without RDS and term neonates.Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation of the Lung — Experience of five CentersG Rocha1, P C Fernandes2, E Proença3, C Quintas4, T Martins5, I Azevedo6, H Guimarães71Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de São João, Porto, Portugal, 2Service of Neonatal and Pediatric Intensive Care, Hospital Geral de Santo António, Porto, Portugal, 3Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Maternidade Júlio Dinis, Porto, Portugal 4Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Service of Pediatrics, Centro Hospitalar de Vila Nova de Gaia, Porto, Portugal, 5Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Service of Pediatrics, Hospital Pedro Hispano, Matosinhos, Porto, Portugal, 6Unit of Pulmonology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de São João, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Porto, Portugal 7Division of Neonatology, Department of Pediatrics, Hospital de São João, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade do Porto, Porto, PortugalBackground and AimsThe clinical spectrum of congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation of the lung (CCAML) ranges from severe respiratory distress to asymptomatic lesions. The objective of this study was to review our experience with CCAML.MethodsA retrospective chart review in five tertiary medical centers in the north of Portugal, between 1999 and 2005.Systemic Hemodynamic Effects of the Association of Inhaled Nitric Oxide and Intravenous Prostacyclin in Isolated Diaphragmatic HerniaT Gaillot1,2, A Beuchée1,2, A Sauret1, P Pladys1,2, P Bétrémieux11Rennes Teaching Hospital, Rennes, France, 2University of Rennes 1, Rennes, FranceBackground and AimsInhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is used to treat persistent pulmonary hypertension of newborn (PPHN). The use of intravenous prostacyclin (IVP), another pulmonary vasodilatator, is limited because of systemic hypotensive effects. Our objective was to investigate the hemodynamic dose-related side effects of IVP in prenatally diagnosed isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia (PDICDH) presenting PPHN despite iNO.MethodsData from 16 consecutive neonates with PDICDH admitted between December 1999 and September 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. iNO (20 ppm) was started with mechanical ventilation. Intravenous prostacyclin was secondary infused in case of PPHN despite iNO, suspected from pre and postductal peripheral oxygen saturation difference and confirmed by US scan. IVP was adapted from the repeated PPNH evaluation. Systemic hypotension was treated with dopamine or noradrenaline. IVP doses were recorded during the rise of doses. Concomitantly, blood lactate levels, dopamine and noradrenalin doses, hourly trends in blood pressure and urine output were recorded. Statistical analysis used ANOVA tests. Results are presented as median [min-max].Capillary pCO2 as a Method of Monitoring Infants with Chronic Lung Disease (CLD) on Supplementary Home OxygenK Reeve1, S McKenzie2, A Shah3, S Fang11Department of Neonatalogy, Homerton University Hospital, London, UK, 2Department of Paediatric Respiratory Medicine, Royal London Hospital, London, UK, 3Department of Paediatrics, North Middlesex University Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsThe discharge criteria and weaning protocols of CLD babies going home on oxygen vary between neonatal units. If pCO2 is raised, pO2 will be reduced and there will be an increased risk of desaturation. Infants with CLD at Homerton are discharged home with oxygen if their pCO2 is &gt;6.0 kPa. The aim is to inform a hypothesis that monitoring of capillary pCO2 is an efficient and reliable method to identify CLD infants who need oxygen at home.MethodsThis is a retrospective study of all infants discharged on home oxygen from 2000 to 2004. Infants were followed up at home and capillary blood gases collected at 1 or 2 monthly intervals at clinic visits.DO 27 Weekers Benefit from Prophylactic Surfactant? A Comparison of two Treatment PoliciesN Yousef1, V Champion1, J Patkai2, G Dassieu1, J H Jarreau21Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Centre Hospitalier Intercommunal de Creteil, Creteil, France, 2Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Centre Hospitalier Cochin-Port-Royal, Paris, FranceBackground and AimsCurrent recommendations for prophylactic surfactant use for prevention of RDS in ELBW infants do not include recommendations on threshold GAThis study aims to determine the impact of prophylactic versus curative surfactant administration in a population of inborn ELBW infants at 27 wk GA.MethodsBi-centric retrospective study from 2 NICUs with comparable recruitment, but different surfactant use policies (prophylactic surfactant &lt;28 wk GA for centre 1 (C1) and &lt;27 wk GA for centre 2 (C2).), comparing results for ELBW for 27 wk GA. ELBW for 26 wk and 28 wk GA were included to assess bias due to inter-hospital variations.Survival Rate and Prevalence of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Elbw Infants: The Brindisi ExperienceG Latini1, 2, A Del Vecchio1, G Presta3, G Ladisa1, C De Felice41Division of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy, 2Clinical Physiology Institute (IFC-CNR), National Research Council of Italy, Lecce Section, Italy 3Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Cardinal Panico, Tricase, Italy, 4Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, ItalyBackground and AimsBronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) continues to be one of the most common longterm complications of preterm birth. BPD is currently infrequent in infants with birth weight greater than 1200 g or &gt; 30 weeks’ gestation against a reported BPD prevalence of about 30% among extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, as an increasing number of them survive. Although a new form is emerging, BPD is very often preceded by the use of mechanical ventilation early in life. A very low prevalence of BPD in our neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), commonly using a minimal handling ventilatory approach, has recently been reported. The aim of this study was to compare survival rate and in our ELBW infants population between two different time periods (period 2: last 42 months vs. period 1: July 1, 1986 –June 30, 2002).MethodsFrequencies of oxygen-dependency≥28 days (BPD 28-d) and/or oxygen-dependency ≥36 weeks postmenstrual age plus oxygen-dependency ≥28 days (BPD 36 wk) and survival rates for the selected time periods were obtained.The Correlation Between the Severity of Respiratory Distress Syndrome and Tracheal Procalcitonin Levels in Premature BabiesN Narli1, F Mahsereci1, T İnal2, K Özcan1, F Mahsereci1, H Yapıcıǧlo lu1, M Satar11Div of Neonatology, 2Dept of Biochemistry, Çukurova University Faculty of Medicine, Adana, TurkeyBackground and AimsWe aimed to study the correlation between the severity of Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS) and tracheal procalcitonin levels in premature babies.Methods60 premature babies with RDS with a mean gestational age of 29,5 ± 1,8 (26–32) weeks and mean birth weight of 1017,8 ± 168,3 (650–1300) g were included in the study. Tracheal aspirates were collected on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21 and 28 if the babies were still on ventilator, and procalcitonin levels were studied.Use of Sildenafil in Three Cases of Neonatal Pulmonary HypertensionG Cavallaro, C Bottura, E Cerini, L Andaloro, R Astolfi, G Compagnoni Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, ‘Carlo Poma’ Hospital, Mantua, ItalyBackground and AimsThe neonatal pulmonary hypertension (PPHN) (1,9% alive births) is characterized by persistent high pulmonary vascular resistances. Therapy can be based on the use of selective vasodilatators like epoprostenol and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), expensive, not so easy to use and toxic. Sildenafil, vasodilatator developed for the treatment of the erectile dysfunction, has been recently proposed as alternative or associative therapy, because of its efficacy, safety, low cost, easiness to use.MethodsStudy show the clinical history of three newborns (&gt; 33 weeks G.A.) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) caused by early onset sepsis and pulmonary hypertension, efficacy treated with Sildenafil.Oral Sildenafil (Viagra) Treatment of Pulmonary Hypertension in a Preterm Neonate with Severe IUGRK Bohlin, M Bartocci, M Blennow, B SahlgrenKarolinska Institutet, Division of Pediatrics, Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, SwedenBackground and AimsThe phosphodiesterase inhibitor sildenafil is a selective pulmonary vasodilator and a promising new treatment option in pulmonary hypertension. In neonates, sildenafil has mainly been used for refractory cases in addition to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO). Placental insufficiency with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) may impair lung development and sildenafil has experimentally been shown to promote alveolar growth and lung angiogenesis.MethodsWe report a case of severe pulmonary hypertension in a preterm infant with pronounced IUGR, gestational age 28 weeks, birth weight 450 g.Neonatal Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension Refractory to Inhaled Nitric Oxide Treated With Milrinone: Presentation Of A CaseC Tzialla, R M Cerbo, G F Perotti, T Figar, C Viganò, M StronatiNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo, Pavia, ItalyBackground and AimsCurrent therapy of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) consists of optimal lung inflation, hemodynamic support and selective vasodilatation with inhaled nitric oxide (NO). However, not all infants will respond. Several animal studies have demonstrated that Milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor routinely used to prevent post-operative cardiac failure in infants dilates the pulmonary vessels. We present a case of PPHN treated with a combination of NO and Milrinone.MethodsA 38- week-gestation female infant (birth weight: 3680 g.) was born by elective caesarean section. Respiratory failure was developed shortly after birth. Echocardiogram confirmed PPHN: estimated right ventricle systolic pressure of 64 mmHg and bidirectional flow through a large PFO and PDA. Fever, neutropenia, increased C-reactive protein were also developed. Despite full ventilation she remained hypoxemic and NO was administered at maximum dose of 26 ppm, but the initial good response did not last long. Milrinone i.v. was started at 0,25mcg/kg/min, then increased at 0,75mcg/kg/min. Milrinone and NO were discontinued 8 days later and the infant was extubated.Congenital Idiopathic Chylothorax: Report of two CasesA Nika, N Iacovidou, S Mouskou, H DellagrammaticasNeonatal Department, Aglaia Kyriakou Childrens Hospital, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsChylothorax is the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space. The congenital idiopathic form is rare, being more common in males.MethodsCase 1Bilateral chylothorax was diagnosed in a male fetus and pleuroamniotic tubes were inserted at 31 weeks and maintained until birth at 32+2 weeks gestation. After birth the pleural effusion resolved on the left side within 48 hours and the chest tube was removed. However reappearance of the infusion of increasing volume on the right side required multiple insertions of chest tubes. The course was further complicated by systemic fungal infection requiring removal of the two drains on the right side both of which grew Candida albicans. Repeated thoracocenteses were subsequently performed and a trial of the somatostatin analogue, ocreotide was finally associated with successful resolution of the pleural effusion.Tracheal Bronchus Supplying the Right and Middle Lobe: A Case Report in a Premature NeonateA Nika, N Iacovidou, A Alexaki, H DellagrammaticasNeonatal Department, Aglaia Kyriakou Childrens Hospital, Athens, GreeceBackground and AimsTracheal bronchus encompasses a variety of congenital anomalies diagnosed with increasing frequency as a result of refinements of diagnosing imaging and endoscopy. It is a recognized cause of respiratory morbidity in children and association with other structural airway anomalies, cardiac defects, Down's and VACTERL syndrome have been described. We report an apparently unique case of Rt tracheal bronchus supplying the whole right upper and right middle lobe in a premature neonate and its association with vascular anomalies and dysplastic changes in the liver.MethodsHis hospital course was complicated by long term ventilation following persistent Rt lobe atelectasis and consequently almost massive collapse of the Rt lung. Bronchoscopy and airway imaging confirmed the presence of tracheal stenosis and tracheal bronchus. The infant had a stormy course and died at the age of 4 months.The Effect of Centralisation on Mortality of Infants Born Very Prematurely in FinlandL Rautava1, L Lehtonen1, M Peltola2, E Korvenranta1, H Korvenranta3, M Linna2, M Hallman4, S Andersson5, M Gissler2, J Leipälä6, O Tammela7, U Häkkinen2, For the PERFECT Preterm Infant Study Group81Department of Pediatrics, Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, 2National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health (STAKES), Centre for Health Economics (CHESS), Helsinki, Finland 3Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland 4Department of Pediatrics, Oulu University Hospital, Oulu, Finland, 5Department of Pediatrics, Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Helsinki, Finland 6Department of Pediatrics, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland, 7Department of Pediatrics, Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland, 8FinlandBackground and AimsThe rapid development of neonatal intensive care may widen the performance differences between centres. We need up-to-date comparison of outcomes on prematurely born infants treated in different hospitals. Our aim was to test the hypothesis that the level of the delivery hospital affects one-year mortality of very preterm infants in Finland.MethodsThis Medical Birth Register study included all Finnish delivery hospitals with very preterm births in 2000 through to 2003. There were 2291 infants born very prematurely (gestational age below 32 weeks or birth weight 1500 grams or less) in 14 level II (central) or 5 level III (university) hospitals during the study period. The main outcome measure was one-year mortality.Impact of Resuscitation of Likely Non-Viable Infants: A Cost-Utility Analysis in the United StatesJ C Partridge1, A B Caughey2, M D Sendowski1, E A Drey2, S E Little2, A M Martinez11Department of Pediatrics, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USA, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, University of California San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, USABackground and AimsUnder current practices of selective resuscitation in the United States, most infants born at 20–24 weeks gestation are not resuscitated. Recently-issued guidelines on enforcement of federal laws defining “born-alive” infants may affect physician resuscitation practices. Under these guidelines, withholding of “appropriate medical care” could be construed as a violation of Child Abuse Prevention Treatment Act or the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. We wished to examine the theoretical effects of enforcement of this federal legislation by comparing routine resuscitation were this legislation enforced to current selective resuscitation practices.MethodsWe designed a decision analysis model comparing current individualized resuscitation practices to the enforced resuscitating of all potentially-viable infants (20–24 wks GA) whether born after preterm delivery (PTD) or elective termination of pregnancy (TAb). We used a theoretical US-population cohort with primary outcomes as maternal quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), numbers of moderately/severely disabled survivors, and costs.Effects of Oral and Vaginal Indomethacin on No, Cyclic GMP and Cyclic AMP in a Rabbit Model for Preterm BirthK D Beharry1, W Fortson2, H D Modanlou11Department of Pediatrics, University of California Irvine, Irvine, CA, USA, 2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Miller Children's Hospital, Long Beach, CA, USABackground and AimsNO maintains uterine quiescence and promotes cervical ripening via cGMP and cAMP. Suppression of cAMP in amniotic fluid is associated with fetal distress. The effects of oral and vaginal indomethacin on NO, cGMP and cAMP were examined in a rabbit model for preterm birth.MethodsPregnant rabbits (n=6/group) were induced with RU486 prior to administration of oral indomethacin (OI, 20 mg); oral vehicle (OV); vaginal indomethacin (VI, 20 mg in cocoa butter); or cocoa butter only (placebo, VP) once daily for 2 days. Uterus, cervix, fetal membranes and amniotic fluid were analyzed for NO metabolites (NOx), cGMP and cAMP levels.Increased Serum Mono-Ethylhexyl Phthalate Concentrations in Women with MiscarriagesG Latini1.3, S Luisi3, C De Felice4, A Del Vecchio1, F Ruggeri5, P Mazzeo5, F Petraglia31Division of Neonatology, Perrino Hospital, Brindisi, Italy, 2Clinical Physiology Institute (IFC-CNR) National Research Council of Italy, Lecce Section, Italy3Department of Pediatrics, Obstetrics, and Reproductive Medicine, University of Siena, Italy, 4Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Senese, Siena, Italy5Department of Chemistry, Chemical Engineering and Materials, University of L'Aquila, L'Aquila, ItalyBackground and AimsDi-(2-ethylhexyl)-phthalate (DEHP), the most commonly used plasticiser in flexible polyvinylchloride (PVC) formulations, is a widespread ubiquitous environmental contaminant. To date, little information exists on the potential role of exposure to DEHP and its primary active metabolite, monoethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), on early pregnancy development. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the concentration in maternal circulation of DEHP and/or MEHP in women with high risk of spontaneous miscarriage.MethodsThree groups of pregnant women were enrolled: Threatened miscarriage (n=17), complete miscarriage (n=20) and healthy pregnancy (n=20). Serum DEHP and MEHP concentrations were measured by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).Long-Term Outcome of Very Low Birth Weight Infants (VLBWI) Born to Mothers with DiabetesY Kono, J Mishina, H Hara, T Takamura, I Sakuma, S Kusuda, H NishidaMaternal and Perinatal Center, Tokyo Women's Medical University, Tokyo, JapanBackground and AimsThe long-term outcome of VLBWI that could be complicated by maternal diabetes mellitus (DM) is not known. We investigated influence of maternal DM on the outcome of VLBWI admitted in TWMU Hospital from 1984 to 2003.MethodsMortality and neurological impairment (after following for more than 18 mo) rates were compared in singleton VLBWI (BW&lt;1500 g) born to mothers with DM (IDMs, n=30, 3 with gestational DM) and without DM (controls, n=421, excluding cases with maternal complications before pregnancy). Numbers of infants for long-term follow-up were 18 vs 332 (IDMs vs controls).Short Term Follow Up of Children from Pregnancies Obtained Through in Vitro FertilizationB Marinescu1, A I Toma2, L Dracea1, A Vultur11Department of Human Assisted Reproduction, ‘Panait Sarbu’ Hospital, Bucharest, Romania, 2Department of Neonatology, ‘Panait Sarbu’ Hospital, Bucharest, RomaniaBackground and AimsTo follow the somatic and neurobehavioral outcome at 2 years of age for children from pregnancies obtained after in vitro fertilization (IVF).MethodsThere were formed 2 groups: One from children born after IVF procedures and one control group from children born after normal pregnancies, all born at term. They were followed at 21–24 months by Bayley Infant Neurodevelopmental Screener (BINS). There were noted: The total score, the risk group, the scores obtained at different items, weight and head circumference. For comparisons between the 2 samples there was used the Chi Square test (statistically significant for p&lt; 0.05).Home Oxygenotherapy in Children with BPD: 10 Years’ Experience at Neonatal Tertiary Centre in PlzenJ Dort, E DortovaDepartment of Neonatology, Charles University Hospital, Plzen, Czech RepublicBackground and AimsTo evaluate the contribution of home oxygenotherapy (OT) to the treatment of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). BPD occurs in a significant proportion of very and extremely low birth weight infants in the Czech Republic as in other developed countries. OT is an important therapeutic tool of their treatment.MethodsA retrospective cohort study of infants with BPD on home OT. Authors describe the way oxygenotherapy is conducted at home conditions under supervision of skilled Neonatologist.Outcomes in Moderately Premature Infants in the NICUI Rod, T FarstadDepartment of Neonatology, Akershus University Hospital, Nordbyhagen, NorwayBackground and AimsNewborns 30– 34 weeks gestational age (wGA) make up to 20– 25% of all admission to NICU. The aim of present study was to describe the NICU and post discharge course of this group.MethodsHospital based prospective study done by chart review and post discharge charts from hospital and outpatient clinic.Early Home Sending for PrematuresA KyhnæNICU, Hvidovre Hospital, Hvidovre, DenmarkBackground and AimsAt Hvidovre Hospital we are offering the families the possibility for Early Home Sending (EHS). This means that the parents can take their infant home when he/she no longer needs surveillance, are after 34 GA but still needs feeding help. It gives the parents opportunity to re-establish a normal family life with their infant in well known surroundings. Being at EHS means that the family are at home with their infant, getting a visit from a NICU nurse once a week, and goes to the NICU for at control also once a week.MethodsThe parents are being introduced to the EHS in the beginning of the admitting to the NICU, and about 2 weeks before expected EHS we start preparing the parents in going home with their infant. They learn how to tube feed their infant, and how to place the feeding tube. Both parents learn first aid to infants. We have a conversation with the parents regarding their expectations, plans and practical things.Early Oxidative Stress in Down's Syndrome PregnanciesS Perrone, M Longini, G Centini, L De Marco, A Brogna, A Plantulli, B Marzocchi, G BuonocoreDepartment of Pediatrics, Obstetrics and Reproductive Medicine, University of Siena, Siena, ItalyBackground and AimsIndividuals with Down syndrome (DS) have signs of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and possible brain damage prior to birth. Increased oxidative stress (OS) in brains of fetuses with DS has been proposed on the basis of evidence of impaired metabolism of oxygen free radicals and enhanced lipid peroxidation in vitro. We recently demonstrated that isoprostanes (IPs), a new marker of free radical-catalyzed lipid peroxidation, are a reliable marker of early OS in amniotic fluid of pregnancies with FGR. We test the hypothesis that oxidative stress occurs early in DS pregnancies.MethodsConcentrations of IPs were measured by colorimetric enzyme immunoassay in amniotic fluid samples from 56 normal (group I), 23 growth restricted (group II) and 10 DS (group III) fetuses, diagnosed by karyotype analysis of amniotic cells.Potential Use of Autologous Cord Blood Erythrocytes for Early Transfusion Needs of Premature InfantsJ S von Lindern1, A Brand2, M Jansen1, F J Walther11Division of Neonatology, Department of Paediatrics, LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands, 2Sanquin Blood Bank, Leiden, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThis prospective study investigated whether the odds of receiving a red blood cell transfusion in premature infants can be predicted at birth and for whom of these infants harvesting of cord blood for autologous transfusion within 30 days after birth would be worthwhile.MethodsCharacteristics were evaluated from 288 premature infants with a gestational age between 24 and 36 weeks who were admitted to our neonatal centre. In 144 (63%) of these infants cord blood collection was attempted and the early transfusion needs could be compared with the amount of cord blood available for transfusion.Correlation of Red Cell Volume with Hematocrit in VLBW InfantsJ S Mercer1, D Erickson-Owens1, P McMillan2,3, O Silbert2, W Oh2, H Rabe31University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI, USA 2Brown Medical School, Providence, RI, USA 3Rhode Island Hospital Core Research Laboratory, Providence, RI, USA, 3 Department of Neonatology, Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals, Brighton, United KingdomBackground and AimsThe aim of this pilot study was to assess red cell volume (RCV) and to correlate RCV with hematocrit (Hct) in VLBW infants. Evidence suggests that the current practice of Hct to predict RCV is not always an accurate measure of available cells for oxygen delivery to the tissues.MethodsEleven Infants (24 – 29.6 weeks gestation, birth weight 830– 1,250 gm and were transfused between 7 and 27 days of life) were enrolled in the study with parental permission. Before and after transfusion, 0.2 mL of blood was withdrawn. Using flow cytometry, the percentage of red blood cells (RBCs) containing fetal hemoglobin (HgF) were estimated by staining with a fluorescent antibody to the gamma chains of HgF after glutaraldehyde fixation and Triton permeabilization of the RBCs in the pre- and post-transfusion samples. The difference between HgF and HgA in the post-transfusion sample allows for estimates of the pre-transfusion RCV. Prior validation of this method in preterm infants using the biotin method showed a correlation of 0.99.Use of Serial Biochemical Markers in Preterm Neonates to Predict PDA and SepsisA De1, D Housley2, I Ossuetta1, N Smith2, D Freedman21Department of Neonatology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Luton, UK, 2Department of Chemical Pathology, Luton and Dunstable Hospital, Luton, UKBackground and AimsPatent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and sepsis can both present with non-specific signs like apnea and bradycardia in preterm neonates. Biochemical markers like B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is known to have positive correlation with hemodynamically significant PDA, but debate about the threshold value continues. Procalcitonin (PCT) and high-sensitive creactive protein (hsCRP) are sensitive markers of sepsis, but little data on their physiological values exists in preterms. Our study aims at 1) finding the physiological range of BNP, hsCRP and PCT during the first 8 weeks in neonates born at 24–32 weeks gestation and 2) whether serial measurement of BNP, hsCRP and PCT can support or exclude the diagnoses of PDA and sepsis in this group.MethodsSerial measurement of BNP, hsCRP and PCT are done weekly for first 8 weeks in preterm neonates of 24–32 weeks gestation. Echocardiography done to diagnose / follow up PDA. Blood cultures taken as clinically indicated.Pilot Study Using Niro-200 to Observe Tissue Oxygenation Index in the First Three Days of Life in Very Low Birth Weight InfantsA C Doolan, A R TwomeyNational Maternity Hospital, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsNear Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRO) uses light spectroscopy, to provide us with information about oxygenation within the tissues (in this application in the brain). The aims were to measure the Tissue Oxygenation Index (TOI) of Very Low Birth Weight babies (VLBW) over the first three days of life and to determine if the TOI was different in sicker infants.MethodsA total of 12 VLBW babies were observed on Day 1, 2 and 3. These babies were assigned a CRIB score. The NIRO-200 (Hamamatsu) was used to record the TOI. The average TOI was calculated for each baby. The TOI in babies with a CRIB score of 6 and above was then compared to babies with a CRIB score of 5 and below.The Role of Complement and CD14 in Meconium-Induced Cytokine Production in Human Whole BloodB Salvesen1,2, M Fung3, O D Saugstad2, T E Mollnes11Institute of Immunology, University of Oslo and Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway 2Department of Pediatric Research, University of Oslo and Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway 3Tanox Inc., Houston, TX, USABackground and AimsMeconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), an important cause of respiratory distress in term newborns, has a complex and not well defined pathophysiology. We have previously shown that meconium is a potent activator of the complement system in vitro. MAS is associated with a systemic inflammatory response reflected by cytokine production in vivo in a newborn pig model. We investigated whether complement contributed to the inflammatory reaction in MAS and whether CD14-dependent signalling was involved in meconium-induced cytokine production.MethodsHuman whole blood and cord blood collected from different donors were incubated with meconium for 4 hours in the prescence or abscence of anti-CD14 and/or monoclonal antibodies blocking complement (anti-factor D and anti-C2). Proinflammatory cytokines and the terminal complement complex (TCC) were measured.Microparticles as a Index of Platelets Activation in NewbornsA Wasiluk1, M Mantur2, H Kemona2, M Szczepanski1, A Butkiewicz2, J Warda11Department of Neonatology, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, Poland, 2Department of Clinical Laboratory Diagnostics, Medical University of Bialystok, Bialystok, PolandBackground and AimsMicroparticles are procoagulant vesicles shed from an activated platelet membrane. They provide a catalytic phospolipid surface for assembly of factors Xa, Va, and Ca+2 (prothrombinase complex), accelerating blood coagulation. Therefore they play main hemostatic function. We have tested whether there is or not activation of blood platelets in healthy term newborns in umbilical artery expressed by the increase the percentage of microparticles and whether gender affect or not?Methods55 healthy term newborns, 25 girls and 30 boys were introduced to this studies. Microparticles was tested in umbilical artery. Microparticles positively labelled with CD61 were calculated in flow cytometer.Torticollis in NewbornO MojsovaDepartment of Paediatrics, Hospital Veles, Veles, MacedoniaBackground and AimsPresentation of torticolis in newborns during a period of three years conducted in the obstetrics ward, the pediatric ward and the Physical Therapy Department of the Public Health Centre in Veles.MethodsPresentation of a retrospective study in the period of three years (2003, 2004 and 2005) representing fact about newborns in urban and rural areas according to their sex and nationality and their condition at the age of 7 days 15 days 1 month and 6 months respectively.Delay in Measuring OFC in Preterm InfantsE Chakkarapani1, D Rogahn21Department of Neonatology, Liverpool Womens Hospital, Liverpool, UK, 2Department of Paediatrics, Countess of Chester Hospital, Chester, UKBackground and AimsPoor head growth in the postnatal period after preterm birth correlates strongly with minor motor deficits. Abnormal individual head circumference measurements may indicate neurological abnormalities or inadequate brain growth. The late intrauterine and early postnatal periods in human development are characterised by high growth velocity, particularly of the brain. To investigate if Occipitofrontal circumference[OFC] is measured at birth in Preterm infants (&lt; 33 weeks gestation).Methods50 Preterm infants born less than 33 weeks gestation and admitted to SCBU from 2004 – 2005 were studied. Infants transferred from other units were excluded. Data collected: Gestation, birth weight, if birth OFC was measured/not, day OFC measured, ventilated or Cpap used on day 1. Method: Retrospective analysis of case notes and growth chart.Variability of CRIB On Predicting Neonatal Outcomes Across Ten European Cohorts of Very Preterm Babies. Results from the Mosaic ProjectD Di Lallo1, M R G Carrapato2, R Maier3, D Milligan4, P Pezzotti2, J Zeitlin5, E Draper61Agency for Public Health, Rome, Italy, 2Hospital de São Sebastião, Porto, Portugal, 3Phillips University, Marburg, Germany, 4Royal Victoria Infirmary, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, 5INSERM, U149, Paris, France, 6University of Leicester, Leicester, UKBackground and AimsThe Clinical Risk Index for Babies (CRIB) was derived and validated almost a decade ago. This analysis describes the predictive ability of CRIB for in-hospital mortality and morbidity in a more recent European cohort of very preterm babies (VPBs).MethodsThe study population consisted of 4,989 VPBs (22–31 wks of gestational age) born in ten European regions during 2003 and admitted to neonatal care. Perinatal information, including CRIB variables and health outcomes until final discharge or death were collected. 4156 babies had complete data for CRIB score (83.3% of entire cohort). To evaluate the performance of CRIB score we chose as neonatal outcome in-hospital mortality and in-hospital mortality or morbidity (intraventricular haemorrhage of grade IIIIV and/or periventricular leukomalacia and/or bronchopulmonary dysplasia). To examine the discrimination of the CRIB score, we estimated the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs).Very Low Birth Weight Children at Five Years of AgeC Nascimento, L Mendes, F Torgal, R GouveiaDepartment of Child Development, Hospital de Santa Maria, University of Lisbon, Lisbon, PortugalBackground and AimsTo assess psycho-motor development and neuro-behavioural impairment in very low birth weight children (VLBW) followed at the Child Development Department of the University Hospital of Lisbon.MethodsThe A. analysed 68 clinical records of VLBW children followed at the Child Development Department, between January 1992 and June 2000, for obstetrical and perinatal data. The Griffiths Mental Developmental Scale was used to assess psycho-motor development.Can the Criteria for Screening of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) Be Safely Reduced?J U M Termote1, C S P M Uiterwaal2, M van der Heide-Jalving1, M J van Schooneveld31Department of Neonatology, Wilhelmina Children's Hospital, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Julius Centre for Health Sciences and Primary Care, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 3Department of Ophthalmology, University Medical Centre, Utrecht, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsTo evaluate whether a birth weight (BW) &lt; 1250 g and/or gestational age (GA) &lt; 30 weeks could provide a safe screening guideline for identification of all infants at risk for threshold ROP in the central Netherlands.MethodsData of 521 infants admitted between 2000 and 2005 and completely screened for ROP according to the Dutch national guideline (BW &lt; 1500 g and/or GA &lt; 32 weeks or preterms treated ≥ 3 days with FiO2 ≥ 0.4) were retrospectively studied. Incidence and severity of ROP were analysed as well as risk factors for ROP. Statistics: logistic regression.Care-Assistants on the NICUY Hoekstra, H M Kolenbrander-BuurmanErasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsSince 2003 we work in our hospital, the Erasmus MC-Sophia in Rotterdam, on the implementation of the NIDCAP (Newborn Individualized Developmental Care and Assessment Program). This involves a lot of changes in the care of the infant and the involvement of the parents. The care will change from task oriented to patient oriented care.MethodsTo reduce the stress of the infant we wanted to take care with two persons. We prefer to do this with one of the parents. Our NICU is a large unit with a lot of very premature and very sick infants. We often work with less staff. Parents could not always be there because of different reasons (possibilities to stay at the bedside, region and culture). Since two years we work in the Erasmus MC-Sophia with care-assistants. These people (with different background), have had a special individual training. During the care they give support to the baby with containment and consulates the infants. Also for other tasks they could be asked for.Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome: A ReviewJ Campos, F Duque, P Lapa, R HenriquesDepartment of Obstetrics and Neonatology, Coimbra's University Hospital, Coimbra, PortugalBackground and AimsTo determine the incidence, complications, management and outcome of infants with twin-twin transfusion syndrome over a period of five years.MethodsRetrospective review of all infants with twintwin transfusion syndrome born in our department during a period of five years (January 2001 to December 2005). Twin-twin transfusion syndrome was diagnosed in monochorionic twins if one had olygoamnios and was pale and the other had hydramnios and was plethoric with a haemoglobin difference &gt;5g/dl and/or birth weight differences &gt;15%.Low Prepregnant Body Mass Index and Breastfeeding Practices of Healthy Term InfantsG Banderali1, I Giulini Neri1, V Carmine1, G Radaelli2, C Agostoni1, M Giovannini11Department of Paediatrics, San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Milan, Italy, 2Unit of Medical Statistics, San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Milan, ItalyBackground and AimsThe relationship of maternal underweight with breastfeeding has been scantily investigated. The aim of this survey was to examine the relationship of low versus normal prepregnant body mass index (BMI) with breastfeeding practices of healthy infants.MethodsThis prospective observational survey recruited 1272 mother-infant pairs among births occurred at the San Paolo Hospital in Milan, Italy. Infants with birthweight &lt; 2500 g and/or gestational age &lt;37 weeks, and overweight or obese women (BMI &gt;26 kg/m2 according to the Institute of Medicine) were excluded. Prepregnant BMI was calculated from self-reported weight before pregnancy and height measured at the hospital. Underweight was defined as BMI &lt; 19.8 kg/m2. Women were interviewed via telephone through 12 months postdelivery about breastfeeding. Breastfeeding was classified according to the World Health Organization.High Prevalence of Cohen Amongst Irish TravellersA M Murphy1, O S Flanagan2, K P Dunne2, S A Lynch11The National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, 2Department of Paediatrics, University College Hospital Galway, Galway, IrelandBackground and AimsCohen syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, prevalent in the Finnish and Jewish populations. Mutations in COH 1, a large gene on chromosome 8 produce a complex phenotype which evolves with age. The features are a characteristic facies, non- progressive mental retardation and motor delay, microcephaly, neutropenia and recurrent minor infections in the first 6 years of life, long tapering fingers and toes, prominent central incisors, truncal obesity from mid childhood, a warm and socialable personality and a progressive chorioretinal dystrophy which causes almost total blindness by adulthood. We report our recent finding of 5 cases from three different families from the highly consanguineous Irish Traveller community. We are aware of a sixth case in a UK bases Irish Traveller child.MethodsClinical assessment, molecular genetic testing, detailed family pedigrees, estimation of prevalence using Traveller population data from the 2002 Government of Ireland census.Universal Neonatal Hearing Screening: Our Experience on 18,774 NewbornsB De Capua1, D Costantini1, C Martufi2, C De Felice31Dipartimento Cefalico e Scheletrico, U.O.S. Audiologia Clinica, 2Dipartimento Cefalico e Scheletrico, U.O.C. Otorinolaringoiatria, 3D.A.I. Materno-Infantile, U.O.C. Terapia Intensiva Neonatale, A.O.U.S., Siena, ItalyBackground and AimsHearing loss (HL) is likely to be the most common congenital abnormality in humans. As early detection and intervention is critical to prevent the adverse consequences of a delayed diagnosis on speech, language and cognitive development. As 33–50% of all congenital HLs cannot be detected in a selective hearing risk, use of universal neonatal hearing screening (UNHS) programs is expanding. Aims: We tested the value of an UNHS protocol, based on a Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emissions (TEOAEs) two-stage strategy.MethodsTEOAEs (292 DP Echoport OAE Analyzer) were combined to diagnostic ABR evaluation (Amplaid MK12) in newborns at high audiologic risk according to the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing. A total of 18,774 infants were screened (April 1, 1998 – March 27, 2006). Accuracy of the UNHS strategy in predicting congenital HL was evaluated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.Histologic Chorioamnionitis and Otitis Media with Effusion in Preterm Infants During the First Year of LifeC De Felice1, B De Capua2, D Costantini2, C Martufi3, P Toti4, G Latini5,61Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, D.A.I.

Coli Nissle 1917 Stops Acute Diarrhoea in Infants and ToddlersJ Henker1, B M Blokhin2, Y K Bolbot3, V G Maydannik4, C Wolff5, J Schulze51Universitäsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus Der TU Dresden, Dresden, Germany, 2Russian State Medical University, Moscow, Russia, 3Dnepropetrovsk State Medical Academy, Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, 4National Medical University O.O. Bogomolets, Kyiv, Ukraine 5Ardeypharm, Herdecke, GermanyBackground and AimsIn most cases acute diarrhoea will be self-limiting. For children health risks may arise when diarrhoea lasts longer than 3 days. The purpose of the present trial was to normalize the stool frequency of infants and toddlers suffering from acute diarrhoea by administering the probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) quicker than with placebo.MethodsIn total, 113 children (aged 2 to 47 months) with &gt; 3 watery or loose stools in 24 hours were randomized to either verum (EcN suspension with 10E8 viable EcN per ml, n = 55) or placebo (n = 58) in a confirmative, double-blind clinical trial. Depending on the age of patients 1–3 ml per day were administered orally.Intestinal Parasitic Infections and Anthropometric Indicators of Children Growth: A Large Populationbased SurveyJ Nematian, A Gholamrezanezhad, E NematianDepartment of Mycology and Parasitology, Faculty of Medicine, Azad University of Tehran, Tehran, IranBackground and AimsSchool children carry the heaviest burden of morbidity of intestinal parasitic infections. There are numerous data suggestive of their adverse effect on children growth. In the present study, the association between previously undiagnosed intestinal parasitic infections and children growth was assessed cross-sectionally.Methods19213 elementary school children were selected randomly. The physical growth of these children was investigated by taking anthropometric measurements which included body weight and standing height and Z-scores were calculated using New Anthro 1.02 software (CDC/WHO, 1999). Coproparasitoscopic examination was also done with three different methods. The association between intestinal parasitic infection and growth was analyzed with multivariable models adjusted for the influence of age and polyparasitism.Effects of Nutritional and Psychosupportive Interventions on the Course of Infantile Colic — First Results of a Prospective Clinical StudyK Sargsyan, K Burmucic, M Dunitz-Scheer, A C HauerUniversity Hospital for Children and Adolescent Health, Graz, AustriaBackground and AimsInfantile colic is a syndrome characterized by paroxysmal and inconsolable crying without identifiable cause in healthy infant. The aim is the evaluation of a nutritional (lactose reduced partially hydrolysed study formula vs. standard formula) and a psychosupportive intervention in “colicky” babies.MethodsInclusion criteria are “Wessels's” criteria, exclusion criteria are potential organic causes for a colicky state. Study infants are randomly assigned to following groups: 1) Nutritional intervention group (study formula) 2) Nutritional control group 1 (standard formula) 3) psychosupportive intervention group (3 × 45 min. psychotherapy) 4) Nutritional plus psychosupportive intervention group 5) Nutritional observational group (breastfed babies). Infants of group 3 and 4 are seen by the recruiting paediatrician and the psychotherapist on 3 occasions (4–6 weeks); those of group 1, 2, and 5 have only 2 assessment. At recruitment questionnaires are filled in and videotaping of typical feeding scene is performed. Pain scales are used to check continuously colic intensity and quantity.Prevalence of Celiac Disease in Children and Adolescents with Diabetes Mellitus Type I in Southeastern Poland: The Effectiveness of 5-Year Screening ProgrammeB Korczowski1,2, L Lisowicz1, R Jakubiec1, B Surdej11Department of Pediatrics, Regional Hospital No 2, Rzeszów, Poland, 2Institute of Physiotherapy, University of Rzeszów, Rzeszów, PolandBackground and AimsThe prevalence of celiac disease among children with type I diabetes mellitus exceeds the prevalence of the condition in the general population. To investigate the prevalence of celiac disease in the large cohort of children and adolescents with type I diabetes mellitus was the aim of the study.Methods765 children from the Podkarpatian Region with diabetes type I diagnosed in years 1990–2005 were enrolled into the study. Prospective serologic screening was performed in 355 children with diabetes diagnosed during 5 consecutive years between January 2000 and December 2005. Among 410 children with diabetes diagnosed in the period of 10 years — between January 1990 and December 1999, serologic tests for celiac disease were performed exclusively in children with clinical symptoms of malabsorption syndrome. Intestinal biopsy was performed in all children with positive results of serologic tests.Long Term Gastro-Esophageal Reflux Following Congenital Diaphragmatic HerniaM G Peetsold1, H A Heij2, C M Kneepkens1, R J Gemke11Department of Pediatrics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsGastro-esophageal reflux (GER) is a recognized complication of congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), yet its mechanism has not been clarified. In the first years after CDH repair the incidence of GER varies from 20–72%. Long term follow up studies are scarce while most are based on small numbers of patients. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of GER after CDH using a standardized symptom checklist for increased risk of GER in CDH survivors and to identify predictive variables for GER following CDH.MethodsDuring a period of 18 years, 70 of 159 patients (44%) with high-risk CDH survived after surgery. 55 of the 70 survivors (79%) (mean age 12.1 years ± 3.4; range 6–18 years) completed a standardized questionnaire (C. Manterola, 2002). Patient who had a score indicating increased risk of GER were referred for gastroscopy and pH-metry.Celiac Disease in Children.

Periventricular white matter damage (WMD) was considered present on cranial US if cystic periventricular leukomalacia, echodensities persisting for more than 14d without cyst formation, periventricular parenchymal hemorrhagic involvement or ventricular dilatation associated with transient periventricular echodensities was detected.Recurrent Abdominal Pain in Pediatrics: A Potential Precursor of Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders in Adolescents and Young Adults?M T Fernández1, J M Marugan1, L Regueras1, M C Torres2, M C de Fuentes11Hospital de León, León, Spain, 2CAP Jose Aguado, León, SpainBackground and AimsTo determine if functional recurrent abdominal pain in pediatric age (RAF), can predict gastrointestinal or extra digestive functional disorders.MethodsRetrospective longitudinal design of cases and controls. Symptoms-based diagnostic criteria (Roma II) were used to classify the patients with RAF between 1992–1998. The average time since discharge was 7,76 + 1,4 years. The control group (matched for age and sex with the case group) were patients from a primary care center who didn't have RAF. When former consent was obtained, we realized a telephone interview that evaluated the presence of pain, its characteristics, symptoms associated and repercussion in life quality. The study was approved by our Ethic Committee. Statistic comparison with Fischer test.Diencephalic Cachexia of Infancy: Russell's SyndromeA M Murphy1, B Drumm2, C Brenner3, S A Lynch11The National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, Ireland, 2The Children's Research Centre, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, Ireland, 3Department of Radiology, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, IrelandBackground and AimsThe diencephalon is the most rostal part of the brain stem and includes the thalamus, hypothalamus, pituitary and pineal glands and the structures surrounding the third ventricle. Lesions (usually neoplasms) of this region produce a complex of symptoms and signs thought to be related to hypothalamic dysfunction although the exact mechanisms behind the complex phenotype remain unexplained. This particular form of failure to thrive occurs in the setting of elevated growth hormone levels. The condition first came to medical attention at the annual general meeting of the British Paediatric Association in 1951 when Russell described the typical features. In descending order of frequency these are emaciation, increased alertness, hyperkinesis, vomiting, euphoria, nystagmus, irritability, hydrocephalous and optic atrophy. We report a female infant who presented at 16 months of age with severe generalised lipoatrophy, constipation, a normal developmental profile and a subtle rotatory nystagmus which was initially overlooked.MethodsClinical assessment, clinical photographs and brain imaging at diagnosis and at follow up post chemotherapy one year later.The Relationship Between “child Feeding” Behaviour of Mothers And F.T.T in Their ChildrenA AminiDepartment of Pediatrics, Medicine Faculty, Isfahan University, Isfahan, IranBackground and AimsSome children with F.T.T have no organic diseases and their F.T.T may be due to mother-infant relationship during child feeding. The major goal of this study is to find that which elements in maternal ‘child feeding’ behaviour could lead to F.T.T.MethodsTo do this study we chose 50 children with F.T.T and without any organic diseases and 100 healthy children as control group. All children were between 2– 30 months. The study was done in four health care centers in Isfahan city. At first, all children had complete physical examination and evaluation of growth cards. The behavior and reactions of each mother to her child's feeding habits was checked by interview with mothers and a standard questionnaire sheet.

Its etiology is unknown, most therapeutic modalities are empirical, and none are universally satisfactory. The Molecular Adsorbents Recirculating System (MARS) is a novel dialysis technology which efficiently removes albumin bound substances (including bile salts), with promising preliminary results in the management of cholestatic disease. Our aim was to evaluate the usefulness of MARS in relieving cholestasis associated resistant pruritus in a child with Allagile Syndrome.MethodsA 9 year old boy with Allagile syndrome with intractable pruritus, associated with a complex congenital heart disease and moderate renal dysfunction, was studied. He had received standard and second line anti-pruritic medication without symptomatic relief, being send to our institution for evaluation of the possibility of liver transplantation. In spite of his clinical condition, liver transplant was contra-indicated and he was proposed for realization of albumin dialysis (MARS).Indication for Surgery of Neonatal Hydronephrosis Can Predict the Outcome of Renal FunctionJ Langer1,3, J Sedlacek2,3, R Kocvara2,3, J Dvoracek2,3, Z Dite2,3, J Zeman11Department of Paediatrics, Faculty Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, 2Department of Urology, Faculty Hospital, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, 3Department of Urology, Postgraduate Medical School, Prague, Czech RepublicBackground and AimsManagement of neonatal hydronephrosis is a clinical challenge. In our study we evaluated the outcome of renal function in small children with neonatal hydronephrosis after surgically repair according to indication criteria for surgery.MethodsNeonatal hydronephrosis was diagnosed in 38 children. In 28 asymptomatic neonates diagnosed by ultrasound, the indication for surgery was low renal function at the first diuretic radionuclide renography in 11 patients (Group A), progressive pelvicalyceal dilatation in 11 (Group B) and progressive decline in split renal function in 6 (Group C). In another 10 symptomatic neonates or infants, surgery was indicated because of urosepsis (group D).G349A, C881T, G1223A and A3330G Nphs1 Mutation in Children with Diffuse Mesangial HypercellularityA Brodkiewicz1, A Bińczak-Kuleta2, G Adler2, E Szychot2, J Peregud-Pogorzelski1, W Jarmużek3, M Litwin3, R Grenda3, I Kostro4, M Pańczyk-Tomaszewska4, M Roszkowska-Blaim4, A Ciechanowicz211st Department of Pediatrics, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland, 2Department of Pathobiochemistry and Molecular Biology, Pomeranian Medical University, Szczecin, Poland, 3Department of Nephrology and Transplantology, Medical University, Warsaw, Poland, 4Department of Paediatrics and Nephrology, Medical University, Warsaw, PolandBackground and AimsMutations in the NPHS1 gene encoding nephrin, major protein of slit-diaphragm, are responsible for the development of an autosomal recessive nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type (CNF). Therefore, it raises the question whether the NPHS1 mutations might play a role in the pathogenesis of proteinuria in other renal diseases. The aim of our study was to evaluate the association between G349A, C881T, G1223A and A3330G NPHS1 mutation and both the predisposition to mesangial proliferation and prognosis in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) with histologic manifestation of diffuse mesangial hypercellurarity (DMH).MethodsThe study group consisted of 56 children with DMH and 105 healthy children as controls.

Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a common metabolic abnormality in children of all ages. There is evidence of an association of idiopathic hypercalciuria with nephrolithiasis hematuria and osteoporosis. Hypercalciuria is believed to be the cause of variety of urinary tract complaints in children such as UTI. The aim of this study to evaluate the Zahedan. Prevalence of hypercalciuria in children with UTI in children hospital in Iran.MethodsWe studied seventy children (3 month – 15 years) with urinary tract infection one month after recovery and negative urine Culture and compared with control group (normal children) without UTI in the same range of age for hypercalciuria.Prediction of Vesicoureteral Reflux in Infants after First Febrile Urinary Tract InfectionB Orive1, J Elorz2, A Rodriguez11Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Txagorritxu, Vitoria, Spain, 2Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Basurto, Bilbao, SpainBackground and AimsVesicoureteral reflux is a common anomaly in children with urinary tract infection. The presence of reflux, especially high grade reflux, is the most important risk of definitive renal scarring. Controversy remains if now days, with the routine use of prenatal echography, renal ultrasound has additional diagnostic value in the study of uncomplicated urinary tract infection. We analysed clinical, biochemical and imaging parameters associated with vesicoureteral reflux to determine the adjusted value of renal ultrasound.MethodsProspective study of 383 infants with first episode of febrile ITU. There were analysed as predictor variables of vesicoureteral reflux: Age, sex, days of fever after therapy, leucocytosis (&gt;15000), CRP (&gt; 20 mg/l), and ultrasonography. Variables that result significant in univariate analysis with p &lt;0,15 were introduced in a logistic regression. Adjusted OR of significant variables with p &lt;0,1 were used in a Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve AnalysisDoes Surgery Improve Renal Function in Pelviureteric Junction Obstruction?B Orive1, J Elorz2, J Jiménez3, A Villanueva31Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Txagorritxu, Vitoria, Spain, 2Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Basurto, Bilbao, Spain, 3Department of Pediatric Surgery, Hospital Donostia, San Sebastian, SpainBackground and AimsUreteropelvic junction obstruction is the most common urinary tract obstruction in children. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the renal function before and after Anderson-Hynes pyeloplasty in children diagnosed of ureteropelvic junction obstruction.MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed two groups of patients with unilateral ureteropelvic obstuction divided by mode of presentation. Group 1: 31 children diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound. Group 2: 11 patients with symptomatic hydronephrosis. All prenatal diagnosis had obstuctive pattern on 99 TC Mercaptoacetyltriglycine Scintigraphy normalized after pyeloplasty. Descriptive statistic is expressed as median and interquartile range. Age for surgery was : 0,83 years (0,38–1,46) and 8,45 years (6,71–11,83) (median and interquartile) respectively. The paired Wilcoxon and Spearman rank test for nonparametric data were used for statistical analysis.Does Renal Ultrasonography Predict Vesicoureteral Reflux in Infants with Febrile Urinary Tract Infection?B Orive1, J Elorz2, A Rodriguez1, I Hualde11Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Txagorritxu, Vitoria, Spain, 2Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Basurto, Bilbao, SpainBackground and AimsGuidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend renal ultrasound and voiding cystouretrography for young children after first urinary tract infection. The non-invasive nature, the lack of radiation, and the low cost of renal ultrasound have made it an ideal tool for the initial screening investigation in children with febrile urinary tract infection. We evaluate the sensitivity and predictive value of renal ultrasound for vesicoureteral reflux in the diagnostic workup of urinary tract infections within the first 24 months of life.MethodsProspective study of 383 infants hospitalized with first febrile urinary tract infection. All of them had a normal prenatal ultrasound. 141 (36,8%) were males and 242 (63,2%) were females. 291 (76%) were younger than a year. Ultrasonography was performed at hospitalization and cystography was carried out four weeks later. Analysis of frequencies was done with the chi square test. Kendall's Tau-b was used as a measure of ordinal association. Sensitivity, specificity and predictive values for vesicoureteral reflux were calculated.Nephrolitiasis in a Patient with Cystic FibrosisB Orive1, J Elorz2, C Vázquez2, A Marí11Department of Pediatrics, Hospital Txagorritxu, Vitoria, Spain, 2Department of Pediatric Pulmonology, Hospital Cruces, Bilbao, SpainBackground and AimsCystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. Defects in the CFTR gene cause abnormal chloride conductance across the apical membrane of epithelial cells. It results in progressive lung disease and also affects different organs. With longer life expectancy other complications of CF have become more apparent.MethodsWe present a patient with CF and symptomatic nephrolithiasisCPR and Uncontrolled Tidal Volumes (TV) in the Delivery Room (DR) — Increased Risk for Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (Bpd) In Very Preterm Infants&lt;1250G (VLBW)?A Castillo, R Deulofeut, A SolaDepartment of Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USABackground and AimsBPD is multi-factorial. It is unknown if VLBW likely to be exposed to brief periods of “uncontrolled” ventilation, like those requiring “full” DR-cardiopulmonary resuscitation (DR-CPR), are at a higher risk for BPD. The objective was to determine if DR-CPR is associated with BPD in VLBW.MethodsAnalysis of a prospectively collected database of all VLBW infants admitted to two Emory University NICU's from 1/00–12/04 that survived to ≥36 weeks post-conceptional age (PCA). Exclusion criteria were major congenital malformations. DR-CPR was defined as intubation and manual ventilation with chest compression and/or epinephrine use in the DR. The primary outcome variable was BPD, defined as the need for oxygen at 36 weeks PCA. Statistical analysis included bivariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression.The Routine Use of Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure as Primary Support in Respiratory Distress Syndrome May Result in a Significant Delay in the Administration of Synthetic SurfactantC J Dewhurst, L Phillips, D RoghanDepartment of Paediatrics, Countess of Chester Hospital NHS Trust, Chester, Cheshire, UKBackground and AimsIn infants judged to be at risk of developing RDS, early prophylactic administration of synthetic surfactant has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcome. Increasingly NCPAP is being used in such infants for respiratory support. It was our unit's policy that babies who commenced NCPAP did not receive prophylactic surfactant. The aims of this study were to identify factors that could predict which babies would ‘fail’ on NCPAP support and need subsequent surfactant administration and ventilation.MethodsRetrospective study of 70 case notes picked at random, of babies born between May 03 to May 05 at less than 33 completed weeks gestation, were reviewed and data collected on their early respiratory course. This data was entered into Microsoft Excel and analysed.Predictive Value of Different Parameters for Optimal Endotracheal Tube Position in NeonatesF A M van den Dungen, M L J Brouwer, F Meulink, K P Bach, J I M L Verbeke, R M van ElburgDepartment of Pediatrics, Subdivision of Neonatology, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsSimple parameters to estimate the optimal endotracheal tube (ETT) position are warranted as chest radiography is considered the gold standard for ETT position. To estimate the optimal ETT position in AGA and SGA neonates, we studied both retrospectively and prospectively the predictive value of birthweight, weight at intubation, and birth length. In addition, we studied only prospectively sternum length, foot length and nose-tragus distance.MethodsNeonates who were nasotracheally intubated were studied retrospectively and prospectively. Values of birthweight, weight at intubation, birth length, sternum length, foot length and nose-tragus distance were measured. After correction for neutral head position, optimal ETT position in chest radiograph was defined as the position of the tip between 5 mm above tracheal bifurcation and the level of the first thoracic vertebra. Only the first intubation in each patient was used for statistical analysis.Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia and Ventilation ModeT Farstad, M OlsenDepartment of Neonatology, Akershus University Hospital, Norbyhagen, NorwayBackground and AimsMajor risk factors in Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia (BPD) are prematurity, barotrauma, oxygen therapy, and perinatal infections. The aim of this study was to investigate how mechanical ventilation and early nasal CPAP (NCPAP) correlate with incidence of BPD.MethodsInfants with Birth Weight (BW) &lt;1 500 g and Gestation Age (GA) &lt; 34 weeks were identified from prospective NICU records. Data were analyzed to predict risk factors associated with occurrence of BPD. Diagnosis was based on radiological findings and oxygen dependency at postconceptional age of 36 weeks.Health Care Associated Infection in Paediatric Patients on Extracorporeal Life Support: Impact of Multidisciplinary SurveillanceK L Brown1, D A Ridout2, M Shaw1, I Dodkins1, M O#x2019;Callaghan1, L Smith1, A P Goldman1, J C Hartley11Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, London, UK, 2The Centre for Paediatric Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Institute of Child Health, London, UKBackground and AimsObjective was to describe the use of a multi-disciplinary approach to sepsis surveillance and evaluate impact on outcome.Methods215 children supported with ECMO January 1999 — December 2004 were included. A multidisciplinary team met monthly to evaluate cases of sepsis and update unit policies. Changes in practice were made at the end of 2001 in order to tackle a high rate of sepsis: 1) re-education, 2) introduction of electively preprimed ECMO circuits and 3) preference for neck rather than chest cannulation in cardiac patients. Prophylactic antibiotics were used for 24 hours for procedures.Midazolam Requirements are Age Dependant in a Pediatric Intensive Care UnitD H de Gast-Bakker1, S D van der Werff1, R Sibarani-Ponsen1, E L Swart2, F B Plötz11Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands2Department of Pharmacology, VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsMidazolam is one of the most widely used sedative agents in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). We tested the hypothesis that midazolam requirements during prolonged mechanical ventilation in critically ill children is age dependent.MethodsChart records of all children (28 days – 18 year) who were admitted to the PICU between January 1st 2002 and January 1st 2005 were retrospectively analyzed. Inclusion criteria were controlled mechanical ventilation for at least five days and initial sedation with midazolam. The total daily dosage per kilogram body weight of midazolam and other sedatives were calculated during the first five days. Statistical analysis was carried out by means of SPSS 11.Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia — a 15 Year SurveyE Santos, C Veiga, J Peixoto, L Carvalho, J F NevesPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Coimbra's Paediatric Hospital, Coimbra, PortugalBackground and AimsCongenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH) is a condition with a significant morbidity and mortality, with new treatment strategies assayed in the last two decades. Coimbra's Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) is the referral neonatal surgical center of Portugal's central region since the last 25 years. The authors report on the incidence of CDH in the region and the effect of delayed surgery on mortality.MethodsA retrospective analysis of demographic data and prognostic risk factors were made including all the newborn with CDH admitted to PICU during the last 15 years. The newborns were submitted to a similar protocol management except for high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFO) (&gt;1995) and inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) (&gt; 1998).Two Rare Presentations of Congenital Diaphragmatic HerniaA Fernandes1, S Castro1, C Didelet1, A Clington Jr2, H Sá Couto3, A Amador1, J Oliveira Santos41Pediatric Respiratory Diseases Outpatient Department, Nossa Senhora do Rosário Hospital, Barreiro, Portugal 2Departament of Neonatology, Dona Estefania Pediatric Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal, 3Departament of Surgery, Dona Estefania Pediatric Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal 4Pneumology Unit, Dona Estefania Pediatric Hospital, Lisbon, PortugalBackground and AimsCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is the result of incomplete fusion or hypoplasy of one or more of the embryonic components of diaphragm, with an estimated incidence of 1/2000 to 1/5000 births. Morgagni hernia is the least common type of CDH and most are diagnosed late because patients can be asymptomatic or present with non-specific respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Bochdaleck hernia is the most common type of CDH and, unlike Morgagni's, most are dignosed either antenatally or will present with respiratory distress in the first few hours of life. However, some present beyond the neonatal period, posing considerable diagnostic challenges. Chest radiograph is the first and most important diagnostic tool.MethodsTwo cases are reported of late presenting CDH. The first is a Morgagni hernia detected in the chest radiograph of a four month old healthy female infant with first episode of respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed with toracoabdominal ultrasound and computed tomogram. The second is a Bochdaleck hernia diagnosed in a six month old (cronologic) preterm male infant in an abdominal ultrasound for gastroesophageal reflux research, during etiologic investigation of persistent respiratory distress syndrome.Three Different Clinical Presentations of the Same Aspirated MaterialA R Fernandes1, O Sedelnikova1, A J Amador1, J Oliveira Santos21Department of Pediatric Respiratory Diseases Outpatient, Nossa Senhora do Rosário Hospital, Barreiro, Portugal, 2Pneumology Unit, Dona Estefania Pediatric Hospital, Lisbon, PortugalBackground and AimsForeign body aspiration is a serious situation which may result into respiratory distress, pulmonary lesion or even death. More than two thirds of foreign body aspiration cases occur among children under 3 years old and organic materials are the most commonly aspirated. Diagnosis is frequently difficult and delayed, as in about half of the cases the chocking episode is missed, there is a wide range of clinical presentation, which frequently mimics other illnesses, and none of the imaging methods employed in such cases are diagnostic. Bronchoscopy is frequently necessary for diagnosis and treatment. When diagnosis is delayed, complications of a retained foreign body such as unresolving pneumonia, lung abscess, recurrent haemoptysis and bronchiectasis may occur.MethodsThe authors present three cases of foreign body aspiration (sunflower seeds) in patients at different ages and with different clinical presentations; all had a delay in diagnosis ranging from days to months.Tracheo-Esophageal Fistula: Is Chronic Pulmonary Disease Possible?Z Sarevska, M Maneva, L StojanovskaInstitute for Respiratory Diseases in Children-Kozle, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsTracheo-esophageal fistula (TEF) is congenital anomaly of two types: With and without atresio oesophagi. Late sequels are possible like bronchiectasis as result of recurrent respiratory infections or aspiration.MethodsWe would like to describe case of a boy who was born with atresio oesophagy and TEF, which were corrected with surgery, the second day after birth. After that, he had a great number of hospitalizations because of pneumonias e aspirationem, strydor, and cough. During the first year, oesophagus balloon dilatation was made. In this period, bronchoscopy exploration showed bronchomalatio, as a result of surgery. Because of recurrent symptoms, many investigations were made when a boy was 5 years old.Eventration of the Diaphragm — Case ReportD DervishovChildren Hospital, Veles, MacedoniaBackground and AimsRelaxation and atrophy of the diaphragm is also called event ration. In that situation diaphragm is having high position, causing prolapse of organs in thorax cavity, compression on lungs and dislocation mediastinal organs on the opposite site. Goal: To present 6 months old baby hospitalised on the Children's Department in Medical centre in Veles.MethodsHeteroanamnesis, clinical examination, RTG of lungs, ultrasonography and CTM of diaphragm, laboratory analysisRecurrent Spasmodic Croup and AllergyS Galbova, M Caparoska, O Zafirovski, L Petrusevska, B MladenovicInstitute for Respiratory Diseases in Children, Kozle-Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsThe causes of recurrent spasmodic croup are unclear. The acute onset of the attacks without signs of acute infection, the short duration (few hours or less) and usually excellent respond to a symptomatic therapy, show that allergy may play an important role. The aim of this study is to determinate the probably role of allergy as etiological factor of recurrent spasmodic croup.MethodsA group of 75 children with anamnesis of recurrent croup episodes who were performed to skin prick tests was analyzed. The evidence of family and personal atopy was explored. The most frequent allergens were determined.Ventilatory Strategies in Belgian NicusI Van Herreweghe, G Delanghe, E Chevalier, R Ciardelli, D HaumontNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, Saint-Pierre University Hospital, Brussels, BelgiumBackground and AimsIn 2004 all Belgian NICU admissions were registered in a national database. One fifth of the babies was hospitalised for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). Evidence based guidelines on ventilatory strategies and surfactant administration are well established. The aim of this study was to compare among the different NICU centres the application of these strategies and the pulmonary outcome in Very Low Birth-weight Infants (VLBWI).MethodsRecords of 840 VLBWI were analysed. Duration of endotracheal ventilation and CPAP, surfactant administration, chronic lung disease (CLD) at 36 weeks, presence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) (grade 3 or&gt;) and steroid use were recorded.Indoor Ecology and Risk Factors for Bronchial Asthma in ChildrenR L Karseladze1, L D Jorjoliani2, N A Katamadze3, M K Tskhakaia21Department of Paediatrics, Iv.

Surgical induction of DH in fetal rabbits during the pseudoglandular phase has been shown to induce severe pulmonary hypoplasia, but functional studies in this model are scarce. We aimed to measure neonatal pulmonary impedance and related it to the severity of lung hypoplasia.MethodsDH was surgically created in rabbits at 23 days of gestation. Following cesarean delivery at term (31 days) pups were subjected to measurement of total lung capacity (TLC), lung to body weight ratio (LBWR) and lung impedance by forced oscillation technique. Airway resistance (Raw), elastance (HL), tissue damping (GL) and hysteresivity (GL/HL) were calculated from impedance data.Joubert Syndrome: A Review of 8 CasesA F El-Hassanien1, H A Al-Ghiaty2, S Mohamed31Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, El-Mansoura University, El-Mansoura, Egypt 2Department of Pediatrics, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Tukh, Kaliobia, Egypt, 3Department of Opthalmology, Faculty of Medicine, Benha University, Tukh, Kaliobia, EgyptBackground and AimsJoubert Syndrome (JS) is a rare genetic brain malformation characterized by absence or underdevelopment of cerebellar vermis. The common features of JS in infants include hyperpnea, nystigmus, mental retardation, and ataxia. The purpose of study is to increase awareness for the clinical and neuroimaging findings of Joubert syndrome for the correct diagnosis of this rare congenital malformation.MethodsEight patients with Joubert syndrome were identified from 3 hospital pediatric departments databases covering a 5-year period. Criteria for diagnosis included absent or markedly hypoplastic cerebellar vermis, abnormal eye movements, and developmental delay. Radiological scans reports, clinical notes, biochemical results and opthalmological evaluation were available for all the 8 patients. 6 cases were clinically reviewed to assess visual electrophysiology and 2 patients had died.The Time to Pee Study: A Randomised Controlled Trial of a Vibrating Bladder Stimulator in ChildrenP Davies1, R Greenwood2, J Benger31Children's Emergency Department, Bristol Royal Hospital for Children, Bristol, UK, 2Research and Development Support Unit, United Bristol Healthcare Trust, Bristol, UK, 3Faculty of Health and Social Care, University of The West of England, Bristol, UKBackground and AimsTo evaluate a commercially available vibrating bladder stimulator for use in reducing the time spent waiting for children to produce a urine sample in acute paediatrics.MethodsAll non-continent children needing a urine sample attending a children's emergency department were included.

In particular, international adopted children represent a group with unique health care needs. Data from published studies suggest that the risk of serious infections in adoptees is low, although evidence-based medicine on which to base screening protocols for this segment of population is lacking.MethodsAll health and vaccination records of some child immigrated or internationally adopted in Ferrara, Italy, were reviewed. If a reliable immunization record is presented, one need not repeat the vaccines or check titers. In absence of documentation, routine serological screening tests for diphtheria, tetanus, poliomyelitis and hepatitis B have been performed. A tuberculin skin test was performed on someone, and a chest radiograph had been obtained for any individual with a positive PPD. In addition, special screening tests (e.g., for malaria, hepatitis C, MMR) were indicated by paediatricians on the basis of specific child's age and/or acute medical needs.Tonsilloadenoidectomia — Yes or NoS Stankovska-Kceva1, A Jancevska2, S Dzekova1, L Veljanovska11ENT Department, Health Center Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia, 2Pediatric Clinic, Medical Faculty Skopje, Skopje, MacedoniaBackground and AimsShort resume of different approaches about Tonsilloadenoidectomia who have specialist for children daisies and ENT specialist during chronicle infected Waldeyerov lymphatic ring considering children.MethodsThe diagnosis of the children was made with ENT examination, hemogram, microbiological finding nose and throat received antybiogram, RTG after Hurthz.

The study was partly conducted prospectively and partly retrospectively. The prospective part, which comprised all the children born after January 1998, and the retrospective part was concerned with children who were born prior to January 1998 by examining the medical records of the children. The cut off age for these children was the 15th birthday. The genetic disorder and major congenital malformations were recorded.The Role of Pediatricians in Prophylaxis of Dental CariesA Nitsch-Osuch, E Gyrczuk, A WardynDepartment of Family Medicine, Medical University of Warsaw, Warsaw, PolandBackground and AimsDental caries (DC) is an infectious and preventable disease of a great social impact. In Polish pre-school children DC is present in more than 90%. The aim of a pediatrician should be to prevent DC by education of children and their parents regarding hygienic and nutritional habits and fluoride supplementation. Our task has been to learn parents knowledge concerning prophylactic procedures connected with DC in their preschool children.MethodsWe obtained fulfilled surveys with questions about prevention of DC from 98 parents of children attending to one of public day care facilities in Warsaw.Breastfeeding the Premature InfantR MaastrupNICU, Rigshospitalet, University Hospital, Copenhagen, DenmarkBackground and AimsA great number of the premature infants are not able to suck at birth due to their immaturity. This challenges the nurse at her professional efforts to create frames and expectation for breastfeeding, and to give support and counselling to the mother for a successfully breastfeeding before discharge.MethodsA breastfeeding policy is developed: Already the first day the mother will be informed about the importance of breastfeeding for the premature infant and encouraged in expressing her milk. Written material is distributed to support oral information. The breastfeeding process, “The Milky-Way” is a guideline in transitioning the premature infant from tube-feeding to exclusively breastfeeding. The first step on “The Milky Way” is skin-to-skin contact. This is easy as in Denmark we mostly use nasal-CPAP rather than ventilator treatment when possible. As soon as the infant is stabile with nasal-CPAP it will be put to the mother's breast to smell and taste and suck for pleasure. This will help the infant to be able to suck sooner when strong enough. The transitioning process will often take time for the premature infant, from days to weeks. During this period the parents and nurse will make daily evaluation of the infant's maturity and abilities as for the plan of breastfeeding.Development and Appliance of Educational Material to Prepare Children and Parents to VenopunctureM L G Pedreira, M A M Pettengill, A R Bezerra, V GuariseDepartment of Nursing, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilBackground and AimsMany children and their parents consider venopuncture as one of the most traumatic event during illness and hospitalization because of their fear of needles and pain. There are evidences relating parent's anxiety during venopuncture and children's stress. Considering that both children and their parents should be prepared for this situation, it is essential to elaborate strategies and instruments, in order to meet their needs, such as the development of educational and instructional material regarding venopuncture. The aim of this paper is to describe the material's construction and its appliance in clinical setting.MethodsA participant methodological framework was performed in a pediatric unit of a public teaching hospital in São Paulo city, Brazil. In order to be acquainted with the scientific evidences, a literature review was carried out. After that, a field phase was conducted, applying qualitative contend analysis to understand the child and parents’ needs of information allied to venopunction, in their perspective, as well in the professionals. Data were compared and organized in a creative book format. Finally, three specialists and the subjects validated the material.Leadership in Neonatal Nursing: Taking It GlobalC D Philips, W Moulsdale, M DeLandNeonatal Intensive Care Unit, Sunnybrook and Womens Health Sciences Centre, Toronto, ON, CanadaBackground and AimsCanadian Neonatal Network and The Shanghai Children's Hospital of Fudan University launched, in October 2005, the People's Republic of China Neonatal Nurses Training Program. This global partnership is aimed at improving the quality and efficacy of neonatal care in China, and provides a unique opportunity for nurses to participate in an evidence-based clinical collaboration. Specific objectives of the program include, establishing a centre dedicated to training neonatal nurses, as well as establishing a national standard for neonatal nursing education in China.MethodsPlanning an international training program requires a focused and committed management team. Essential elements include developing the content and methods for its’ delivery, as well as strategizing logistical details, from immigration requirements, to the preparation and printing of course materials. This dynamic process is ongoing and must include evaluation, and creative problem solving at every stage of program development.Practice Educator on the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: A Much-Needed Professional!R F W Van Den Berg, A P Verest, I van’ t Wout, M van DijkDepartment of Pediatric Surgery, Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThere is a clear role for the practice educator in the pediatric intensive care environment considering the high nursing shortages and turnover of patients. Supervising adults requires skills such as teaching at the learner's level, helping learners to use their knowledge and skills, and adapting supervision to individual needs. This study evaluates the work of two practice educators in pediatric intensive care.MethodsThe two practice educators of the Pediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit of the Erasmus MC-Sophia Children's Hospital retrospectively classified focus of their supervision during the previous two years broadly as follows: Knowledge/skills, psychological and supportive. Thirty-eight nurse students were asked to provide a strength/weakness analysis and information on prior education and working experience.Clinical Supervision in PracticeI M ThrustonPaediatric Intensive Care Unit, Evelina Childrens’ Hospital, Guys’ and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, London, UKBackground and AimsClinical Supervision is an effective process in reducing stress and burnout that staff working in critical care areas can experience. Clinical Supervision has been defined as ‘A formal process of professional support and learning which enables individual practitioners to develop knowledge and competence, assume responsibility for their own practice, and enhance consumer protection and safety of care in complex clinical situations. It is central to the process of learning and to the expansion of the scope of practice and should be seen as the means for encouraging self-assessment and analytic and reflective skills’ (Department of Health, (DOH) 1994).MethodsSupervisory models are useful to provide structure and direction to clinical supervision sessions. Guided reflection offers an effective way of structuring clinical supervision and is central to the process. Many methods for reflection have been identified and different models have been designed.Nursing Indicators IC NeonatologyA T A M ClaassenDepartment of Neonatology, Emma Children's Hospital, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsTo test the ‘List of requirements of the Nursing Care within the Neonatology Department’ (1997). The current testing methods are time consuming and labour-intensive. To develop a set of indicators derived from the norms in the list of requirements. With these indicators the nurses should be able to monitor and direct the delivered care by themselves, and receive continuous feedback of the quality-level of nursing practice.MethodsThe project consists of a development, realization and after-care phase. In the development phase the indicators are developed stepwise. Based on set criteria selections were made. An indicator-development-form describes the method of measurement, the applied criteria and the method of collecting data. During the realization phase the developed indicators will be measured supported by an instruction-measurement-form, which enables every nurse to perform the test (once a month, takes about 3 hours). Results are published monthly on a poster. In the after-care phase, the results are evaluated. When the results are repeatedly below the norm for a specific indicator, an improvement project is started.A Randomized Study of Oral Care Influence on Duration of Mechanical Ventilation and Length of Stay in a PICUD M Kusahara1, M A S Peterlini1, W B Carvalho2, A R Ruiz2, S R Pereira1, M L G Pedreira11Department of Nursing, Federal University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil, 2Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, Hospital São Paulo, São Paulo, BrazilBackground and AimsOral care has been described as capable to prevent VAP, reducing duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay (LOS) and use of systemic antibiotics in adult patients. The aim of this study was to compare the duration of mechanical ventilation and LOS of children in a PICU, according oral care intervention.MethodsProspective randomized study realized in a PICU in the city of São Paulo, Brazil. The research was approved by the ethics committee. The sample was composed of 56 children, 29 (51.8%) in Control Group-CG (mechanical intervention) and 27 (48.2%) in Experimental Group-EG (0.12% chlorhexidine); 47 (83.9%) children received mechanical ventilation. Complementary variables of children's characteristics and intensive care were collected. Significance level (p) was set at 5%.Nasal Continuous Positive Airway Pressure in Severe Acute Bronchiolitis: Evaluation of Time Consumption for NursesC Veyssiere, H Guerrini, A Louis, S Essouri, D DevictorPediatric Intensive Care Unit, CHU Kremlin Bicêtre, Kremlin Bicêtre, FranceBackground and AimsNasal continuous positive airway pressure (NCPAP) in severe acute bronchiolitis is now more largely use. The assistance time spent by nurses in relation to ventilatory support either NCPAP or tracheal ventilation was retrospectively studied.Methods71 infants were included during the 2 last epidemia (2004–2005 and 2005–2006), 42 received NCPAP and 29 were intubated. Quantification of nurse's act (suctioning practices, comfort and relation care) was noted for each infant during the first 24 hours of stay.Mediation in Paediatric Intensive Care — The Way Forward?B J Teuten1, C M Pierce21Medical Directorate, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, UK, 2Paediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Trust, London, UKBackground and AimsConflict between health professionals and families within the intensive care setting is increasing. A new avenue for resolution of potential conflicts within our unit (PICU) came via the Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS) in 2002.MethodsWe performed a review of formal complaints to our hospital and later to PALS between 2001–2004. Point of contact and reason for contact and outcome were reviewed.Towards Debriefing on the PICU!O Stoffels, J Reuselaars, R J Houmes, A van den Bos, I van’ t Wout, D Tibboel, M van DijkPediatric Surgical Intensive Care Unit, Erasmus MC-Sophia, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsCritical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD), was developed in 1983 to manage stress for workers in high risk workplaces such as the emergency room. CISD sessions help participants: (1) to verbalize distress; (2) to form appropriate concepts about stress reactions before false interpretations of the experience are formed; and (3) to return to routine functioning. Debriefing has not yet gained ground in pediatric intensive care despite high incidences of distressing and acute situations. To determine the need for debriefing, we asked our PICU caregivers to assess stressful incidents in which they had been involved.MethodsCaregivers completed a six-item questionnaire after watching videotaped material of incidents in which they had participated, such as resuscitation during ECMO and care of a patient with neurotrauma. The questionnaire included closed questions about communication, safety and negative emotions afterwards. Total score could range from 0 (no impact) to 18 (serious impact of incident).Evelina Childrens Hospital (ECH): A New Paediatric Intensive Care (PICU)D C A Mangani, T J FoxPICU, Forest Ward, Evelina Childrens Hospital, London, UKBackground and AimsGuy's &amp; St Thomas PICU have been based at Guy's site for the past 20 years. Finally on the 17th October 2005 they moved into a new location to the new children's hospital at the St Thomas site which is the beginning of a new era for PICU.MethodsThe aim of this presentation is to concentrate on the planning involved in moving an entire department from one hospital to another and to show the benefits PICU have gained since moving from a 12 funded bed unit to a 20 bedded unit which is now all located on the same floor (previously on two floors) and in close proximity to cardiac theatres and others departments. The move was performed in one day with in-house South Thames Retrieval Service.Implementation of a Patient Data Management System in the NICU: Can the Picu-Template be Converted into the NICU?S De Reus1, B A H Versluis2,31NICU, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Directorate Information, Department of Management and Maintenance Information Systems, Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 3PICU/NICU, Erasmus MC, Sophia Children's Hospital, Rotterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsThe Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) was the last intensive care unit of the Erasmus MC — Sophia Children's Hospital, which had to implement the Patient Data Management System (PDMS). The aim is to work with a PDMS-template that covers the complete nursing record and part of the medical record of the patients in the NICU.MethodsIn the development of a PDMS-template for the NICU, the PDMS-template of the PICU was reviewed for its usage and compatibility of the NICU care processes. The advantage of using the PICU-template might save time and the administrative differences between the NICU and the PICU might be reduced to a better cooperation between healthcare professionals of both units. A group of 2 physicians, 1 nurse practitioner and 17 nurses were trained in the PDMS programme. The professionals placed the data of 30 neonates in the PICU-template and concluded that many specific items could not be placed in this template.Importance of Preventive Child Care from the View of MothersN Dede Çinar1, T M Filiz2, S Sahin1, P Topsever21School of Health Sciences, Sakarya University, Sakarya, Turkey, 2Faculty of Medicine, Department of Family Medicine, Kocaeli University, Kocaeli, TurkeyBackground and AimsAppropriate feeding, immunization and periodic health controls have an impact on pediatric health care. The aim of this study was to assess protective behaviour of families with children between the age of 0–16 years concerning immunization, nutrition and periodic health care.MethodsInclusion criteria for this cross- sectional, descriptive study were, having child/ children between the age of 0–16 years, sharing the same domicile with them, giving informed consent to participate in the study. The study group (n=368) was randomly selected among mothers fulfilling the above criteria. Data were collected during one year between February 2003–2005. For socio-demographic inquiry a semistructured questionnaire consisting of 19 questions was used. After test-retest procedures these 10 items likert scale (1=low importance, 10=utmost importance) questions were used to assess mothers’ attitudes towards their offsprings’ immunization, nutrition, and periodic health care.A Comparison of Growth in Preterm Infants Fed Two Different Types of Infant Formula ProteinK N Florendo1, A VanZwol2, B Bellflower1, R J Cooke11Division of Neonatology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA, 2Division of Neonatology, VU University Medical School, Amsterdam, The NetherlandsBackground and AimsFeeding dies suggest that feeding tolerance is better in preterm infants fed formulas containing hydrolyzed whey proteins. However, concern also exists about the biologic value of such formula. We speculated that tolerance, and, therefore, growth would be better in preterm infants fed hydrolyzed whey-based formula when compared to a standard preterm infant formula.MethodsIn a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial, infants weighing &lt; or = 1750g at birth, &lt; or = 34 weeks gestation, and tolerating 150cc/k/day enterally for &gt;24 hours were randomized to receive standard premature infant formula (Group A) or a premature infant formula containing 100% hydrolyzed whey protein (Group B) for 3 weeks. Anthropometry and blood chemistries (BUN, total protein, albumin) were determined at the beginning of the study and weekly thereafter. At the end of the study, plasma amino acids, fatty acids, transferrin, and retinol binding protein were also determined. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and a per protocol basis. According to data distribution, a difference in weight gain of 3 g/d would be significant. Primary outcome was weight gain; secondary outcomes were feeding tolerance and gains in length and head circumference.Effect of Intravenous Ibuprofen on Bilirubin Binding in Preterm Infants: Interim DataL DesfrereFranceAbstract not available at the time of printing.References1)MurrayR.Writing for academic journals2005MaidenheadOpen University PressMurray R (2005) Writing for academic journals.

In sheep, both maternal undernutrition around the time of conception and a high plane of nutrition in a young mother still growing herself result in impaired maternal metabolic adaptation to pregnancy, and hence greater substrate distribution to maternal at the expense of conceptus tissue accretion. Maternal nutrition in early pregnancy also determines subsequent growth and body composition of the offspring, with mild-moderate maternal undernutrition resulting in offspring of normal body weight at birth but with increased weight of fat depots thereafter. Undernutrition in late pregnancy commonly reduces offspring birthweight, and this in turn affects later growth and body composition. After birth, growth of different tissues is strongly influenced by both prior and current nutritional experiences. Lambs of lower birthweight take longer to start to gain weight after birth. They also require a higher feed intake to attain a given weight gain, and more of that weight is gained as fat and less as muscle compared with lambs of higher birthweight. However for a given birthweight, slower postnatal weight gain is generally associated with a proportionately greater muscle growth. Rate of growth also determines other aspects of body composition. Muscle fibre number, which limits final muscle size, is generally determined before birth, and indeed before the last trimester of pregnancy in many species. Lambs growing rapidly either before or after birth tend to have proportionately larger livers, whereas chronically slow growth is associated with reduced liver size relative to body weight. Similar patterns are seen in the lymphoreticular tissues such as spleen and thymus. It seems likely that these variations in body composition will have important functional consequences for later health and wellbeing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Early Growth and Body Composition of Adolescents</title><p><bold>L A Moreno</bold><sup>1</sup>, I Labayen<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>E.U.

Four different pathways for programming obesity may be proposed: 1) programming central circuits in the hypothalamic area controlling feeding and metabolism, 2) modification of energy expenditure, 3) generation of a hormonal context favouring adipose tissue development, 4) modification of the pools of fat cell precursors which should lead to hypertrophic / hyperplastic obesity. These pathways and their respective importance according to the time-window of exposure and the type of malnutrition are now subject to intense study. Studies on the progressive appearance of insulin resistance in rodents which had been growth-retarded in utero revealed an increased sensitivity of target tissues to insulin in young adults, followed by insulin resistance in older age. The insulin resistance was associated with changes in expression of key components of the insulin-signalling cascade in muscle and adipocytes. The changes in expression of such molecular markers have been detected also in muscle and fat biopsies of men with a low birth weight. Possible molecular mechanisms involved in nutritional programming are just starting to emerge, such as early definitive changes in the organelle central to energy utilisation, i.e. mitochondria, or epigenetic changes in nuclear DNA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Animal models provide efficient tools to reveal the time windows of nutritional experience in early life favouring later obesity, as well as to decipher progressively physiological and molecular mechanisms involved in such metabolic programming.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Human Genome: Implications for Clinical Practice</title><p>J-J Cassiman</p><p>Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Belgium</p><p>The complete and detailed sequence of a representative sample of human DNA is almost fully known, except for a few stretches of hard to sequence DNA. This historic achievement has already generated a few surprises. The number of genes (about 25,000) hidden in the 3 billion nucleotides that make up the human genome is much smaller than initially expected and is only slightly higher than in flies, while the total protein coding sequence is only about 3% of the genome. The OMIM register at www3.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Omim/ lists more than 12,000 entries for monogenic or Mendelian diseases, including 60 mitochondrial diseases. More than 7,000 of these have been already mapped to a particular chromosomal region, while another 2,000 have a definite gene locus. The remaining entries are only phenotypic descriptions or other entries. The molecular basis of these diseases is rapidly being uncovered. In some genes one or a few defects are responsible for a particular phenotype; in others, mutations can be scattered all over the gene e.g. the more than 1000 different mutations in the CFTR gene in cystic fibrosis. The majority of our normal traits and diseases are inherited in a multifactorial fashion. This means that a series of genes (usually tens of genes) are involved, due to either normal variation in their sequence or real dysfunctional mutations. In addition, environmental factors modulate the way in which these genes influence the final phenotype. Traits inherited in this fashion are mainly quantitative (measurable) traits such as height, weight, IQ etc. and show a normal (Gaussian) distribution in the population. Lamarck, who in the 19th century claimed that acquired traits can be inherited, has taken a little revenge in recent years. Some examples have been found of how nutritional factors can condition DNA and affect future generations. As our understanding of the human genome increases, it has become increasingly clear that our knowledge is at present largely insufficient to attempt to explain all the phenotypic variability observed between individuals affected by the same disease. It is only gradually that we will unravel all the genetic and environmental factors responsible for this variability. Nevertheless, many families can already be helped by genetic testing in order to identify with precision what the nature of the disease is and what the recurrence risks are. Even fairly precise prediction of the risk to develop a disease in adult life (presymptomatic diagnosis) or of the susceptibility to develop serious multifactorial diseases, such as hereditary breast or colorectal cancer, is available. Nevertheless we have to guarantee our clients that these tests are done with the best quality available and in the context of appropriate genetic counseling.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Genes and Environmental Influence in Asthma and Atopy</title><p>R Nickel</p><p>Department of Pediatric Pneumology and Immunology, Charit&#x000e9;, Berlin, Germany</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Despite a strong genetic basis for asthma and atopy, no genetic marker(s) unambiguously associated with atopy-related traits has yet been identified. Variants in &#x0003e; 100 candidate genes were associated with atopy-related traits. However, replication (at least twice) was reported for less than 30 genes. Discrepant results may partly be attributed type 1 and type 2 errors due to small sample sizes or no correction for multiple tests. Also, different ethnicities of study populations have to be considered. There is growing evidence that gene-by-gene- and gene-byenvironment interactions strongly influence disease susceptibility and that single variant association studies are not sufficient to identify the genetic basis for atopic disorders. With regard to the development of asthma and atopy, environmental factors (e.g. factors associated with living on a farm, allergen exposure, infections) appear to be particularly important very early in life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Methods</title><p>Therefore, many gene-by-environment-interaction studies have been performed in pediatric populations and birth cohorts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Strong evidence for interactions has been presented for genes involved in LPS (lipopoly-saccharide) binding and signalling: One of the most extensively examined candidate gene for atopy is CD14, coding for a receptor for LPS. A CD14 promoter variant was associated with both, low and high total serum IgE levels (tIgE), other studies showed no effect on tIgE. Recent studies that focused on CD14 genotypes and endotoxin exposure suggest strong gene-by-environment interactions with the CD14 variant being either protective or a risk factor for asthma or increased tIgE dependent on low or high endotoxin exposure. Toll like receptor (TLR) genes have also been investigated in asthma and atopy. TLRs are crucial for recognition of microbial pattern associated molecules. A TLR2 variant was associated with a decreased risk for asthma, but this effect was exclusively seen in children living on a farm, also implying a gene-by-environment interaction. Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure has been intensely investigated in gene-by-environment interaction studies. An example is studies of an IL13 variant within a large German birth cohort. Significant associations with tIgE and a common promoter variant were observed at any age from 1 to 7 years. ETS exposure in utero and/or infancy resulted in even higher tIgE in children homozygous for the variant, but with no effect on tIgE in the remaining children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>ETS-, endotoxin- and allergen exposure are important environmental factors with regard to asthma and atopy. Exposure can be assessed and quantified in standardized procedures. Other factors that may contribute to the increased prevalence of atopy (and therefore of interest for gene-by-environment interaction studies) are harder to assess in a standardized fashion (e.g. diet, infections, medication, stress), which is an ongoing effort of current birth cohort studies in our division. Taken together, genetic studies of asthma and atopy not only require large carefully characterized, ethnically homogeneous study populations, but also data on environmental exposure such as endotoxin, ETS and allergens. Birth cohorts are particularly valuable for gene-by-environment interaction studies since exposure can be assessed in early infancy, a most vulnerable period of life with regard to the development of asthma and atopy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Clinical Implications of Systems Biology and High-Throughput Technology in Pediatrics</title><p>M Benson</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, Queen Silvia Children's Hospital, Gothenburg, Sweden</p><sec id="Sec19"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Complex diseases like diabetes, allergy and cancer depend on multiple interacting genes.

One such study may identify hundreds or even thousands of genes that differ in expression between patients and controls. While this may be seen as discouraging it does reflect the complexity of the diseases that we study. Moreover, if we can get a grip on this complexity this may be used for clinical purposes, for example to find combinations of markers for individualized therapy. Systems biology is an emerging discipline that aims to understand how complex systems relate to biological effects. One important theoretical framework is network-based analysis. In the context of DNA microarray studies, genes that differ in expression between patients and controls are organized in gene interaction networks. Such networks can be analyzed in a top-down fashion. The idea is the same as a microscopic examination. You start with a low magnification to identify general features of the sample and then proceed to detailed studies of individual cells. A gene interaction network can be analyzed to find sub-networks or pathways with distinct functions, such as cell proliferation or apoptosis. These sub-networks can be further dissected to find upstream genes with putative key regulatory functions. Typically, several sub-networks or pathways are involved in complex diseases. However, a top-down analysis may result in identification of combinations of key genes that can be used for clinical purposes, such as to find markers for personalized medication. In this presentation examples from our own research in allergic disease will be given, as well as from oncological research. In the latter case customized DNA microarrays are tried to find gene expression signatures for personalized medication in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>High-throughput studies and systems biology may contribute to understanding of complex diseases.

There was understandable great excitement surrounding the discovery in 1989 of DeltaF508, the most common gene mutation for cystic fibrosis. As a recessive single gene defect disease the possibility of replacing the defective gene was a stimulating prospect. Seventeen years later, whilst other single gene defects have been corrected, a solution to the cystic fibrosis gene defect remains unresolved. The reasons for this lack of resolution are frustrating to patients and clinicians, but have opened novel and fruitful research directions. What can be so complex about this single gene defect? Firstly, there isn't just one gene defect, there are no more than 1000 genes identified associated with cystic fibrosis, falling into five functional classes. Secondly, we have become increasingly aware that the interplay of ancillary &#x0201c;modifier&#x0201d; genes play an important but as yet poorly quantified effect on the principle gene defect. Thirdly, as with other diseases, the complex evolving phenotype of cystic fibrosis, incorporates the interplay of genotype and environment, together with the possible role of epigenetics (heritable changes in gene function that occur without a change in the DNA sequence). Together these factors add a substantial complexity to what was considered a simple model of disease. Into this environment, the next generation of pulmonary trials for correction of the cystic fibrosis gene defect are now being planned. The first pulmonary trials were successful (in that gene transfer occurred), but not enough and side effects too many. Important lessons were learnt, and following a hiatus to reform the whole infrastructure of the gene delivery systems further trials are now planned. There are expected additional problems in children, not least of which is how will we know if gene transfer works. Yet children are considered the linchpin to the success of such studies (repairing the defect before major pulmonary injury has occurred) and research is underway to ensure that children should not be disenfranchised from this major biotechnological advance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec39"><title>Betamethasone Effects on Perinatal Pulmonary Development in an Escherichia Coli Experimental Model of Intra Uterine Infection in the Rabbit</title><p><bold>N Joram</bold><sup>1,3</sup>, E Launay<sup>1,3</sup>, J C Roze<sup>3</sup>, M L Franco-Montoya<sup>2</sup>, J Bourbon<sup>2</sup>, C Gras-Le Guen<sup>1,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Laboratoire d'Antibiologie, CHU Nantes, France</p><p><sup>2</sup>Laboratoire INSERM U651, Cr&#x000e9;teil, France</p><p><sup>3</sup>Departement de Perinatologie, CHU Nantes, France</p><sec id="Sec40"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Chorioamnionitis is known to play a central role in its pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

Currently the provisions of the text await final implementation: the new system should be operational in Q2 of 2007 at the latest. The purposes are to facilitate and increase the development of medicines for children, promote a high quality of research, consolidate the ethical approach of clinical trials. The system hits inevitably new products at first submission or if claiming a new indication, a new route of administration, a new dosage or a new pharmaceutical form. The system is optional for unpatented drugs. Those still patented get a 6 months extension of their protection, the others a 10 years paediatric registration if they comply with the paediatric investigational plan (PIP). The PIP intents to assure availability of data and an age appropriate formulation. PIP means a research and development programme intended to obtain a paediatric indication. PIP will specify the timing and measures proposed to assess the quality, safety and efficacy in all subsets of the paediatric populations possibly concerned. The scope of the PIP includes the formulation(s), the preclinical safety, the clinical efficacy, the pharmaco-vigilance and any appropriate risk management plan. The timing of the PIP should be precised. In specific circumstances a PIP will be waived (likelihood of inefficacy, safety concerns, conditions occurring in adults only, or some ages groups might be waived [neonates&#x02026;]). The PIP will be assessed by a Paediatric Committee (PECO) where each member state will be represented, as will be healthcare professionals and patients/parents (groups). The PECO will assess the proposed PIP and an agreement (or deferral/waiver) should be reached before the submission of the adult (part of the) dossier. If no discussion of PECO is included in a new application, the adult dossier cannot be validated. The PECO will also define compliance criteria that the company should fulfil before it can be decided that the requirements of the PIP have been met. This compliance will condition the 6 months extension, whatever the final results of the studies conducted. A failed PIP can thus lead to the incentives, provided this &#x02018;negative&#x02019; information is incorporated in the product information. In order to facilitate the conduct of the PIP the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) has set a number of measures: guidance on quality assessments of paediatric formulations, guidance on preclinical toxicity studies in juvenile animals, proposals on PK-PD studies and some reflection on the paediatric specificity of pharmacovigilance and risk minimisation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec80"><title>A Blinded Randomized Clinical Trial of Clonidine in Combination with Diluted Tincture of Opium (DTO) Versus DTO Alone for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS)</title><p><bold>A G Agthe</bold><sup>1,2</sup>, K B Mathias<sup>3</sup>, C W Hendrix<sup>2</sup>, L Jansson<sup>2,4</sup>, M Yaster<sup>2</sup>, T R Roark<sup>2</sup>, E B Gauda<sup>2,3,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Maryland Medical Center, Baltimore, MD, USA, <sup>2</sup>Johns Hopkins Medical Institution, Baltimore, MD, USA, <sup>3</sup>Mt.

It is proposed that members of the T-box family of transcription factors play a crucial role in the formation of the building plan of the heart. Tbx5 confers craniocaudal polarity to the heart tube, whereas Tbx2 and Tbx3 prevent the cardiac inflow tract, atrioventricular region, outflow tract, as well as the cardiac inner curvatures from chamber differentiation. With the exception of the outflow tract that becomes incorporated into the ventricles, these regions contribute to the cardiac conduction system. Tbx1 specifically is involved in the formation of the outflow tract, whereas Tbx18 is involved in the formation of the systemic venous tributaries. One of the most fascinating aspects in the formation of the heart is the very early development of the electrical patterning as can be registered by the ECG, which is the registration of the rhythmic waves of depolarising activity over the cardiac muscle. In the mature heart the conduction system is responsible for the rhythmic excitations and contractions. However, in chicken embryos a sinusoidal type of ECG can already be derived from the linear heart tube stages at about two days of development, and less than one day later when chamber formation has just been initiated, an adult type of ECG can be monitored. The question can thus justifiably be asked whether the presence of an adult type of ECG in these early embryonic hearts implies the presence of a conduction system. Generally, the conduction system is defined as the system of specialized myocardial tissues responsible for initiation and propagation of the sinus impulse. If we accept this functional definition, then the early embryonic heart has a conduction system, which is already in place, because there is an adult type of ECG. On the other hand, if we would apply strict anatomical and histological definitions, the embryonic heart undeniably lacks a conduction system. This field of tension concerning the recognition of the conduction system using physiological versus anatomical / histological criteria has led to many controversies in the field.. In this contribution we discuss the specification of the embryonic areas that will become chamber and those areas that will not form chambers and participate in the formation of the distinct components of the conduction system. Another intriguing aspect is how during evolution the cardiac components of the pulmonary circulation evolved. Recently, a novel cardiac field, the so-called secondary heart-forming field, has been described. This field is localized centrally from the classic cardiac crescent on the embryonic disc. We discuss the view that the so-called second heart-forming field contributes to the cardiac components of the evolutionary new pulmonary circulation, being the right ventricle and outflow tract as well as the mediastinal myocardium, which gives rise to the atrial septum and the dorsal wall of the left atrium. Both types of myocardium are derived from the mesenchyme that is localized centrally from the classic cardiac crescent.</p></sec><sec id="Sec121"><title>Cardiac Output Measurement Using a Modified Carbon Dioxide Fick Method: A Validation Study in Ventilated Lambs</title><p><bold>W P de Boode</bold><sup>1</sup>, J G van der Hoeven<sup>2</sup>, O Dani&#x000eb;s<sup>3</sup>, J C W Hopman<sup>4</sup>, K D Liem<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Neonatology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands</p><p><sup>2</sup>Department of Intensive Care, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands <sup>3</sup>Department of Pediatric Cardiology, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, <sup>4</sup>Department of Clinical Physics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands</p><sec id="Sec122"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Cardiac output can be measured using a modified carbon dioxide Fick (mCO2- F) method.

It remains a major concern for paediatricians and typically affects infants younger than two years, principally during winter months. Bronchiolitis is a self-limited illness in most previously healthy infants and resolves frequently without complications. However, severely affected infants are at increased risk for complications. Assessment of disease severity is very important in the management of bronchiolitis. Neither for assessment of severity nor for hospitalisation nor for treatment recommendations are official criteria in place. Although there is a lack of well established criteria a number of guidelines have been published.</p></sec><sec id="Sec163"><title>Methods</title><p>In this comparative survey appropriate guidelines were taken from the European French and German speaking paediatric scholarly societies (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland).

Despite recent guidelines part of these children are rehydrated with intravenous fluids and hospitalisation stay is prolonged. Our objective is to evaluate whether rehydration with oral rehydration solution during a four-hour period in the hospital is safe and efficient in children with acute gastroenteritis. Primary outcome is the success rate, that is the percentage of children who are successfully rehydrated and sent home after rehydration.

The results were analysed by the method of Maso (1994). Data generation took place by means of semi-structured interviews with nurses working in the NICU of the Wilhelmina Kinderziekenhuis (University Medical Centre in Utrecht) and by literature study. The moral model used was the so called &#x02018;Model of Nijmegen&#x02019; for moral reasoning.

However, there is a trend that parents do not like to leave their child. Those parents who have witnessed CPR, would wish to stay again. Parental presence during resuscitation seems to have no long-term adverse effects. Among professionals, controversies remain on this subject. Arguments against parental presence range from traumatic experience of parents to disturbance of professional performance. However, there is a tendency to give parents the choice to stay. Most articles conclude with the words &#x02018;allow, support, encourage, give the opportunity&#x02019; to present the view on parental witnessed resuscitation. Guidelines are therefore necessary to state the departments&#x02019; vision and practice. An increasing tendency is observed towards the development of official position statements. Supposing that the current data to support parental presence during CPR is insufficient, the latest CPR guidelines provide a positive advice towards parental presence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec250" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Although still controversial in many countries, there is a strong and supportive trend towards parental presence during resuscitation.

Yet the evidence suggests that children's participation may be more rhetoric than reality. There is limited empirical data on hospitalised children's participation in consultations and decision-making in Ireland. Hence this paper reports on children's experiences of involvement and consultation in their health care in hospital. Ensuring that the views of children are taken into account in matters affecting them is consistent with the vision of the Irish National Children's Strategy, which is &#x0201c;an Ireland where children are respected as young citizens with a valued contribution to make, and a voice of their own&#x0201d; (2000, p4). Aims: (a) To describe children's experiences of consultation in the healthcare setting.

Although many of these decisions are taken in good cooperation between parents and doctors, both the process of decision making and the decisions themselves can create an enormous burden for the parents. During the process of decision making, caregivers frequently disagree, leaving the parents in even greater distress. In the Netherlands, termination of life in newborns with hopeless and unbearable suffering is considered a criminal offence, even if it takes place on explicit request of the parents.</p></sec><sec id="Sec268"><title>Methods</title><p>Dilemma is a foundation that supports parents that have questions about life and death of their seriously ill or handicapped child, either before or after birth.

Dilemma runs a telephone number, situated at the desk of the Dutch Paediatric Association. The foundation's backbone is a number of volunteers and a network of independent professional experts.</p></sec><sec id="Sec269" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>During the last 10 years some 30 persons contacted Dilemma each year. Of all questions, 30% regarded information, 50% counseling and 20% explicitly requested ending of treatment or ending of life. The content of the questions regarded medical facts like prognosis of the disease, risks of operations, possibilities of other treatments; legal questions like rights of parents, rights of doctors to continue or end treatment and the procedure of a law suit. Counseling was sometimes very practical like helping to arrange a burial of a very young fetus after abortion or providing for a second opinion. In all cases the counseling included the need for conversation, trust and support. The requests for life ending measures lead to extended discussions about future perspective of the child, benefit of treatment, meaning of life and the amount of suffering a human may endure. In turmoil of feelings, anxiety, agony, lost of trust, guilt, love and resignation alternate. Controversies between parents and doctors have been arisen on continuing or withholding treatment, parents&#x02019; request for purposely ending the life of their child, insufficient communication, counseling or support and confusion about the medical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec270" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that there's a consistent and urgent need for consultation and information with parents who are involved in decisions regarding the (end-of-life in) sick child.

Focused on Navarre data until 2005 we do not observe this decrease. The explanation is that the data collection methodology in Emergency Room Units has substantially varied, increasing the number of blood cultures performed, so adjusting IPD rates by blood cultures you could obtain more reliable data on changes of incidence (Fig.<xref rid="MO3" ref-type="">1</xref>).</p><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="431_2006_Article_349_Fig5" id="MO3"/><p>In Madrid based on the data from hospital discharges obtained by the Basic Minimal Data Set, a progressive decrease on the incidence of IPD is detected from 1999 onwards, mainly due to a decrease in pneumococcal pneumonias.

In long-term surveillance studies is necessary adjusting the results by methodologies changes (blood cultures, PCR&#x02026;). The disease burden must continue to be monitored and analyzed according to the characteristics of the epidemiological vigilance methods developed in each Region. The BoH must establish a pneumococcal surveillance system in Spain to control the pneumococcal disease at all ages.

Many of these substances have high allergenic properties. At the same time considerable number of substances that reach the gut, have enzymatic activity. Thus it is possible that these substances are able to induce injuries in the intestinal mucosa, so disrupting the intestinal barrier, and permitting the pass of allergens into the circulation. Furthermore, there are many evidences that suggest that Allergy is a systemic disease, with a local expression. Thus, and considering the allergic child as a whole, it is convenient to consider the gut, not as a isolated entity, but more properly as an organ interconnected with others which constitute the integral Mucosal Immune System (MIS). The interactions between different organs involved in the MIS are critical in the development of localized symptoms. In consequence, from an allergologic point of view, the gut should be observed: A) As a barrier element, that blocks the pass to the systemic circulation of substances able to develop systemic or remote localized allergic symptoms. B) As a crucial element for the development of immunologic tolerance during the first days/weeks of life. C) As a direct target organ for digestive allergic sensitizations. D) As an indirect target organ for allergic sensitizations acquired through other ways. In the case of predominant digestive symptoms, diagnostic difficulties are remarkable, because of: The similarity of digestive allergic symptoms with other gastro-enterologic diseases. The existence of different immunologic mechanisms involved in the development of food hypersensitivity phenomena. The possibility that the hypersensitivity phenomenon be locally restricted, without a detectable systemic reflection. This can happens in the earlier stages of sensitization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec285" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Anyway, considering the growing prevalence of allergic disease in industrialized countries, it is conceivable that digestive allergy is following the same trend. In consequence, paediatricians should be aware about this possibility in cases or recurrent or persistent gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly when the child has concomitant allergic manifestations in other organs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec286"><title>Oral Tolerance: Where are We?</title><p>A Muraro</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, University of Padua, Italy</p><p>Abstract not available at the time of printing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec287"><title>Successful Therapy of Unspecific Prolonged Diarrhoea in Infants and Toddlers with the Probiotic E.

I will focus on antenatal and early postnatal inflammatory effects on the preterm lung, as the effects are directly relevant to bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The chorioamnionitis frequently associated with preterm delivery has two disparate effects on the fetal lung &#x02014; an injury similar to mild BPD with alveolar simplification and microvascular injury and induced lung maturation. The lung maturation results in less clinical RDS but many of these infants progress to BPD, perhaps because they have augmented inflammatory responses to postnatal pro-inflammatory stimuli such as resuscitation, lung stretch, and oxygen exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec314"><title>Methods</title><p>We have used fetal sheep models to demonstrate that intra-amniotic pro-inflammatory mediators such as E. coli endotoxin, IL-1, or Ureaplasma organisms cause chorioamnionitis and lung inflammation. Following the fetal exposures to intraamniotic mediators, the fetal lungs are assessed for inflammation (inflammatory cells, cytokine expression, vascular injury), and lung maturation (gas exchange, lung gas volumes, surfactant).</p></sec><sec id="Sec315" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The lung maturation requires the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the fetal lung (demonstrated by blocking CD-18 or IL-1 receptors). Lung inflammation is mild, even with repetitive exposures to the mediators. The inflammatory exposure also induces maturation of monocytes to alveolar macrophages and modulates systemic and lung innate immune responses. Ventilation of the preterm sheep lung with tidal volumes of 15 ml/kg also initiates recruitment of monocytes and granulocytes and induces pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Subsequent ventilation even after surfactant treatment further increases the inflammatory response. Any mechanical ventilation of the preterm lung likely further promotes inflammation and injury, as does oxygen exposure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec316" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The combination of antenatal and/or resuscitation induced injury and modulation of innate inflammatory responses in the developing lung contribute to the development of BPD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec317"><title>Surfactants Today and Tomorrow</title><p>H L Halliday</p><p>Royal Maternity Hospital and Honorary Professor of Child Health, Queens University Belfast, Northern Ireland</p><sec id="Sec318"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Surfactant treatment is now about 25 years old and it has undoubtedly had a major impact on neonatal care and outcomes.

Eighteen of the RCTs for RDS compared 2 or more surfactant preparations, with the most frequently used being Curosurf and Survanta but altogether 11 different surfactants were studied. Twelve systematic reviews wewre found and these demonstrated the superiority of delivery room surfactant over selective use later in the neonatal unit in babies less than 30 weeks&#x02019; gestation, natural over synthetic surfactants and the absence of significant long-term developmental problems. Of the non-randomised trials those reporting novel delivery methods, the failure to use evidencebased guidelines and the clear benefit of surfactant treatment in babies of less than 25 weeks were the most interesting.</p></sec><sec id="Sec321" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Surfactant remains one of the most effective and safest treatments in neonatal medicine. Prophylactic natural surfactant is the most evidence-based treatment for babies of less than 30 weeks. Of the newer synthetic surfactants, only Surfaxin has been compared with currently used surfactants and systematic reviews may be needed to determine its role in the treatment of RDS. Improvement in outcome of babies less than 25 weeks has been due to a number of interventions including prenatal steroids, prenatal antibiotics and postnatal surfactant.

However, the prevalence of pulmonary sequelae has not declined as might have been hoped or expected from improved management, thereby increasing the burden of respiratory health care delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec324"><title>Methods</title><p>The residual respiratory problems of preterm, low birth weight infants following discharge from neonatal intensive care often persist into childhood with significant respiratory morbidity, including frequent cough and wheeze. Even in the absence of such symptoms, there may be sub-clinical changes associated with airway obstruction, hyperinflation, increased airway reactivity and exercise limitation. These problems may improve with age and somatic growth in some individuals, but remain persistent in others. Although those who required a high level of intensive care or who developed chronic lung disease of infancy/bronchopulmonary dysplasia, are more likely to be affected beyond infancy, these adverse effects have also been observed in children born prematurely but without significant neonatal disease. Improved ongoing surveillance of individuals born preterm is essential if we are to understand the mechanisms and long term impact of such early life insults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec325" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Despite a vast literature regarding respiratory outcomes of preterm delivery during infancy (see recent series on Lung Function in Infants with CLDI, in Pediatric Pulmonology: 2005&#x02013;2006), relatively little is known about respiratory health of these subjects during later childhood and adulthood, particularly in those with severe neonatal disease in whom survival was so poor prior to the 1980s. If research into the structural and functional aspects of lung growth and development following preterm delivery is to have any impact on subsequent clinical practice, it is essential to develop more objective physiological definitions of CLDI and to discriminate between what we may be able to influence (i.e. choice of therapeutic modalities) from that which we cannot (such as effects of low birth weight and sex). Consequently, research in this field is challenged by the need to separate the independent effects of a) genetic predisposition, b) preterm delivery per se, c) intrauterine growth retardation d) neonatal respiratory disorders and the related range of treatment strategies and e) impact of early environmental insults (including exposure to tobacco products and infections) on subsequent lung growth and development (see also Stocks J.

As such, the measurement of lung volumes have been demonstrated to be an useful marker of the severity of the respiratory disease in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1</xref>). Routine evaluation of forced vital capacity (FVC), maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure and peak cough flow is suggested early in the course of the disease by the American Thoracic Society (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2</xref>). However, noninvasive volitional tests of lung and respiratory muscle function can be misleading because these tests require aptitude, cooperation, motivation and coordination, which explains that reliable measures may be difficult to obtain in young children.</p></sec><sec id="Sec344"><title>Methods</title><p>In order to evaluate inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength in children with various neuromuscular diseases, 41 patients, aged 2 to 18 years, with DMD (n=20), spinal amyotrophy (n=8), and congenital myopathy (n=13), were asked to perform a sniff and a cough maneuver, as well as a FVC maneuver. In addition, diaphragmatic strength was assessed by a nonvolitional test, i.e the magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves (TwPdi) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec345" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>All the patients were able to perform the sniff and the cough maneuver, whereas only 25 (61%) patients were able to perform FVC. Sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure decreased with age in patients with DMD whereas it increased with age in patients with spinal amyotrophy and congenital myopathy. Magnetic stimulation of the phrenic nerves was obtained in all patients and in the three groups of patients, a significant correlation was observed between the volitional sniff maneuver and the non-volitional test of diaphragmatic strength, i.e. TwPdi. Also, FVC correlated with sniff transdiaphragmatic pressure and cough gastric pressure. In patients with DMD, minute ventilation and lung volumes, assessed by functional residual capacity and FVC, decreased with age. Thus, in DMD patients, the progression of respiratory muscle weakness with age translates into the development of alveolar hypoventilation. Indeed, the patients with DMD who required non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) had significantly weaker inspiratory and expiratory muscles and a lower FVC than those who did not need NPPV. Respiratory muscle output, as reflected by the oesophageal (PTPes) and the diaphragmatic pressure-time products (PTPdi), which represents the work of breathing, was also calculated. In all patients, the PTPes and PTPdi were 2 to 3 times normal values, whatever the diagnosis and age of the patients. This increase in respiratory muscle output may be explained by the microatelectasis, the &#x02018;stiffening&#x02019; and the deformity of the chest and contributes to the ventilatory imbalance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec346" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the natural history of respiratory muscle weakness depends on the type of neuromuscular disease.

This neonatal oral imitation is observed only in humans and great apes such as chimpanzees, indicating that this oral function is innate and mostly specific in humans. In this study, we investigated the possibility whether patients with severe motor dysfunction demonstrated similar imitation seen in neonate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec359"><title>Methods</title><p>Fourteen patients were included in this study. They were rarely able to vocalize or move their extremities voluntarily. First, a therapist sang a favorite song of each patient for five minutes.

Drugs were administered with the explicit intention of hastening death in similar percentages of all deaths (Belgium: 7%; Netherlands: 9%), but Dutch physicians more often estimated the shortening of life more than one week than Belgian physicians. In the Netherlands, the decision was more often than in Belgium discussed with parents (96%, 81% respectively), and with colleague-physicians (94%, 80% respectively).

In some countries physicians feel they have the obligation to discuss these issues with parents and, ultimately, to make decisions while in other countries physicians are convinced that these decisions are not part of the medical domain. Quality of life aspects are taken into account in the decision-making process in some countries while in other countries the future quality of life can never be an argument in these decision-making processes. Next to the future quality of life, the presence of suffering can be an aspect in the decision-making process. In some countries physicians are convinced that all suffering can always be sufficiently and effectively treated with medication. In The Netherlands it is accepted that it is not possible to effectively alleviate suffering in all patients with medication and that active ending the life in some infants can be the only way to alleviate suffering. In these extreme situations actively ending the life of an infant is considered to be acceptable in The Netherlands, while in other countries it is considered to be murder. Are opinions regarding these ethical questions indeed very different between countries, and if so, do we know why these differences exist? Or, on the other hand, is it mainly the way we discuss these inssues. In my opinion differences in opinion exist. However, they are not as extreme as they might like. Secondly, physicians are influenced by the cultural and religious environment, and also by the legal system. An open discussion regarding these issues is very important within Europe. Not that one opinion is superior over the other, but these discussions can help physicians in different countries to make their view and thereby the decision making more clear and explicit. Discussing these issues therefore is not telling what is wrong and what is right, but will help to make proper decisions. Ethics is not the science that makes decisions, but the science that helps to assistent by formulating the proper questions in the decision-making process.</p></sec><sec id="Sec383"><title>Care at the End-of-Life in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit</title><p><bold>C Pal</bold><sup>1</sup>, P Habibi<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Paediatric Intensive Care Unit, St Mary's Hospital NHS Trust, London, <sup>2</sup>Imperial College School of Medicine, London, UK</p><sec id="Sec384"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Many deaths on a Paediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) can be anticipated.

End of life care is discussed with families, so their wishes can be taken into account when managing children dying on PICU.

The quality of care at the end of life should be investigated by examining the family's perceptions of such care.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec388"><title>With Care: Teaching Compassionate Withdrawal of Life Support in the Nicu.

The advances made by medical technology nevertheless sometimes confront parents and doctors alike with difficult dilemmas over what is the appropriate decision to make. Does a child, for example, have a right to life, at whatever the cost? In questions like this the medical profession wields considerable power and it is the doctors who may in reality decide how best to fulfil a child's rights. In the event of a dispute between parents and doctors, the courts may be asked to intervene. At that point, medical paternalism may be replaced by judicial paternalism, with the child's own perspectives slipping into second place. This aim of this analysis of the neonates#x2019; right to life (or death) deals with the extent to which children's right to life can be endangered by decisions relating to their. Specifically this discussion will address 3 objectives: (i) The limits to parents#x2019; powers and the relevance of physical or mental handicap (ii) A child's right to life and parents#x2019; objections to lifesaving treatment. (iii) Withholding treatment from desperately ill babies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec400"><title>Methods</title><p>This discussion brings together the analytic methodologies of jurisprudence and philosophy. As legal philosophy is nothing else that general philosophy applied to law, it uses the same methodology as philosophy in general. Legal theory, for its part, lays an emphasis on plural and interdisciplinary approaches, in addition to the more traditional analytical methodology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec401" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The law continues to cause difficulties for doctors and parents who may be unable to determine in advance what the child's quality of life will be if medical intervention continues. Doctors have an unenviable task when managing the treatment of these babies. Although there have been calls for legislation to clarify the law on neonaticide, the enormity of the moral and legal problems facing an intending legislator makes the prospect of legislation remote. There are obviously no right or wrong answers, but it is certainly unrealistic to claim that every child has a right to life; some children even have the right to die.</p></sec><sec id="Sec402" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Doctors increasingly influence the extent to which children's rights are protected when decisions are made regarding treatment. Although they have the expertise to protect children's medical rights, they are not necessarily in the best position to advise over rights, such as a child's right to bodily integrity, to be consulted, and treated with respect. But whilst doctors are not always the best judges of what is in the child's best interests, nor are the parents, who not surprisingly may find it impossible to be objective over the decisions to be made. The courts too may lose sight of their duty to protect the child's own rights from being infringed by decisions which appear to be in the best interests but which may be more to do with those of her carers. Children's rights should not be lost somewhere in the middle, between parental, medical and judicial paternalism.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec403"><title>Cardiovascular Risk Factors at Age 30 Following Preterm Birth</title><p><bold>S R Dalziel</bold><sup>1,2,3</sup>, V Parag<sup>3</sup>, A Rodgers<sup>3</sup>, J E Harding<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Great Ormond Street Hospital, London, UK, <sup>2</sup>Liggins Institute, The University of Auckland, New Zealand <sup>3</sup>Clinical Trials Research Unit, The University of Auckland, New Zealand</p><sec id="Sec404"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Recent epidemiological evidence has shown increased rates of cardiovascular mortality and associated risk factors in those born small.

Human infants that die of respiratory distress shortly after birth have been shown to have a high fluid content of the lungs.

In recent years remarkable experimental advances have elucidated many of the cellular and vascular mechanisms of perinatal brain damage showing a correlation between the nature of the injury and the maturation of the brain. Advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) techniques have recently provided us with new data on fine structural alteration of the brain in these high risk newborns and have helped us to understand the brains structural alterations and their consequences for later brain development. MRI provides unequaled sensitivity as compared to CT or ultrasound for evaluating developmental changes and the pathological processes in the perinatal brain. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a recent MR modality which assesses water diffusion in biological tissues at a microstructural level, has revealed a powerful technique to explore the structural basis of normal brain development. In fact, the tissue organization can be probed non-invasively, and the age-related changes of diffusion parameters (mean diffusivity, anisotropy) reveal important maturational processes, such as white matter myelination. Early detection of brain injury is crucial for interventions aimed at preventing and reversing ongoing injury. DTI can show early changes at the cellular level that are not detectable by any other imaging modality. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) further allows us to some extent to study the underlying metabolic mechanisms that define the pathophysiologic events that take place in perinatal brain injury. Understanding early human brain connectivity is of great clinical importance, as many neurological and neurobehavioral disorders have their origin in early structural and functional cerebral organization. With the development of 3D fiber tractography, based on DTI, the maturation of white matter connectivity can be followed throughout infant development into adulthood with the potential to study correlations between abnormalities on DTI and ultimate neurologic/cognitive outcome. The non-invasive technique of functional MRI can be considered as the leading technique for functional exploration of the infant's brain with localisation of functional brain activation upon sensory, motor and cognitive tasks. Advanced MRI in the newborn brain has allowed to study the structural correlate of early brain development and plasticity in the developing organism.</p></sec><sec id="Sec433"><title>Could Power Doppler (PD) be A Diagnostic Tool for Early Intervention in Middle Cerebral Artery Infarction (MCAI) in Neonates?</title><p><bold>M C Bravo</bold><sup>1</sup>, A Pellicer<sup>1</sup>, L Dumandzic<sup>1</sup>, R Madero<sup>2</sup>, J Quero<sup>1</sup>, F Caba&#x000f1;as<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Neonatology, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain, <sup>2</sup>Division of Statistics, La Paz University Hospital, Madrid, Spain</p><sec id="Sec434"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Although lesion topography in MCAI appears crucial regarding outcome, the earlier the identification of events leading to structural brain damage the greater the possibility of intervention.

Exhaled nitric oxide (FENO) measurement FENO has been studied extensively, validated as a non-invasive marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma, and standardized for use in clinical practice. Guidelines for standardized FENO measurement have been published jointly by ATS and ERS and normal reference values with the recommended technique are available for children 4&#x02013;17 years old. The single breath online method (SBOL) is the gold standard for FENO measurement in cooperating children. The child inhales NO-free air to near-total lung capacity, and then exhales at a constant flow of 50 ml/sec for at least 4 seconds. On-line FENO measurement during spontaneous breathing has been applied in children aged 2&#x02013;5 years old, with the exhalation flow manually adjusted to 50 ml/sec by changing the exhalation resistance. The method is not well standardized, however, and still requires some passive co-operation. FENO may have a role as a diagnostic tool. Avital et al. showed that FENO can differentiate asthmatic young children from nonasthmatic cases with chronic cough. In addition, in children with recurrent wheezing, raised FENO values may be useful in identifying patients most likely to respond to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS). FENO measurement is also useful in asthma follow-up. In children, FENO levels have been demonstrated to predict asthma relapse after discontinuing steroids and to predict the failure of attempts to reduce ICS dosages. Exhaled breath condensate (EBC) Exhaled breath condensate, obtained by cooling exhaled air, contains water vapor and micro-droplets, the composition of which is believed to reflect that of the airway lining fluid. EBC collection is totally non-invasive and easy to perform even in children. Recommendations have been recently published on how to collect EBC. The drawbacks of EBC analysis lie in that the concentrations of mediators in EBC are low, the anatomical sources of the compounds measured in EBC are not well defined and most of the measurements are not done in real time. A large number of mediators have been measured in EBC. Markers of oxidative stress- as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), isoprostanes, aldehydes and nitrotyrosine- are increased in asthmatic subjects, while glutathione (a protective lung antioxidant) is reduced. Beside, inflammatory metabolites, such as cysteinyl leukotrienes (Cys-LTs), have been found increased in allergic asthmatic children, despite corticosteroid treatment. Also, a reduced EBC pH has been reported in asthmatic children, suggesting that a dysregulation in airway pH homeostasis may have a role in asthma pathogenesis. Conclusion Exhaled nitric oxide has been established as a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation in asthma and recent studies have included FENO measurement in treatment algorithms. Exhaled breath condensate is a non-invasive technique for sampling the airways, which has the potential to offer new insight on lung disease pathobiology.</p></sec><sec id="Sec514"><title>Impact of Changing Practice with the Use of CPAP</title><p><bold>T del Moral</bold>, N Claure, S Vanbuskirk, E Bancalari</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, University of Miami, FL, USA</p><sec id="Sec515"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Early Continuous Positive Airway Pressure may reduce lung damage by decreasing the need for mechanical ventilation and it is increasingly used as an alternative strategy for ELBW infants with RDS.

Surfactant proteins, such as SP-B, and various ionic and nonionic polymers, such as hyaluronan (HA) or polyethylene glycol (PEG), can reduce inhibition of adsorption caused by serum.

These standards and guidelines provide essential support and guidance to both nursing and medical staff whilst caring for children who require this complex intervention. In the early 1990's, a core group of nurses experienced in CVVH, were established. This group continue to lead and manage this challenging service. They are responsible for formulating and guiding practice, and provide support within the multidisciplinary team. Achievements of the group to date include:

The competency document allows &#x02018;experts&#x02019; in the core group to assess nurses caring for children who require and receive CVVH, ensuring competencies are met and standards maintained. Specific CVVH Study Day's and yearly updates form part of the PICU Education Plan to ensure nurses are given time to develop their knowledge and skills in this challenging area. The use of reflection is encouraged throughout this process. Annual National CVVH meetings also help to ensure knowledge and experiences are shared throughout the United Kingdom and provide the opportunity for staff to discuss their experiences and best practice. The initial aims of the group have been achieved and we continue to review practice whilst evaluating the effectiveness of care delivered.

These patients have a constant need of high technology equipment to stay alive and the treatment will unfortunately at times involve prolonged support for weeks, months, years or even permanently. The required treatment will differ from oxygen inhalation to ventilator support, extensive medication to intravenous infusions, peritoneal dialysis or renal replacement therapy etc. Appropriate care is a challenge as life in hospital is an unsuitable environment for these children as well as an inappropriate use of hospital funding and resources. A transition of care has to take place and the pathway is important for the outcome. To shift the responsibility from hospital professionals toward home care services lies mainly on the neonatologist, paediatrician or health care coordinator. It is important to have a strategy and a well-prepared schedule prior to discharge. Many problems with technical equipment, home environment, staff etc will arise during the process and needs to be taken care of in a professional way. We also need to address emotional, economical and moral issues related to caring for a technology- dependent child at home. By using research, case reports and reflections from parents I will try to enlighten the physiological, psychological as well as the social problems we are facing during our efforts to give a good quality care to the child and family in the home environment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec641"><title>First Experiences with Intrahospital Transfer of Preterm Infants and Sick Newborns on a Omnibed as Transport Inkubator (Monitoring, Ventilator) Without Changing the Unit</title><p><bold>M Schindler</bold>, I Berlett, S Dahlmann, F Loersch</p><p>University Children's Hospital, Mannheim, Germany</p><sec id="Sec642"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>In the last few years in our hospital we have to transfer sick newborns from delivery room to NICU in a transport incubator.

Co-bedding can be seen as the continuation of the proximity and interaction experienced during the intrauterine period of multiple-gestation infants after birth. It seems reasonably to assume that multiple-gestation infants are born with expectations based on their earlier intrauterine experiences. The transition of multiple-gestation to the extra uterine life can be simplified through stimuli generated by the continuous uninterrupted physical contact. The aim of this project was to study literature and collect information on co-bedding, mainly on the adverse effects of co-bedding.

Their prognosis are closely related to early diagnosis and treatment but clinical signs are very poorly specific nor sensitive. In this context, paediatricians frequently initiate early antibiotherapy, exposing non infected newborns to unnecessary treatment. The aim of our work was to evaluate the value of procalcitonin (PCT) as an early and specific marker of perinatal bacterial sepsis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec663"><title>Methods</title><p>Two different studies were conducted. In 197 neonates with suspected materno-foetal infection, serum procalcitonin and C-Reactive Protein concentrations were measured simultaneously in umbilical cord blood and in maternal blood. According to clinical and bacteriological course, three groups were defined: group 1 = infected (n=16); group 2= colonized (n=20); group 3 = non infected and non colonized In 176 preterm neonates (mean 29,8). Hospitalised in neonatal intensive care units more than 48h and with a clinical suspicion of nosocomial infection, PCT was determined immediatly and 24 hours later. Two groups were defined: infected and non infected.</p></sec><sec id="Sec664" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In the population with suspected maternofoetal infection, a statistically higher serum procalcitonin concentration was found in the infected group versus controls and colonized (p&#x0003c;0.05). According to the the ROC curves, we chose a cut-off point of 0,5 ng/ml for PCT and 5mg/l for CRP. A PCT value greater or equal to 0.5 ng/ml was observed in 14/16 infected newborns and in 2/181 non infected newborns. The CRP dosage was &#x0003e; 5 mg/l in 8/16 infected newborns. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values were respectively 87.5% (95% confidence interval 71 to 100), 98.7% (97.7 to 99.7), 87.5% (71 to 100), and 98.7% (97.7 to 99.7) for PCT, and 50% (25 to 75), 97% (94 to 100), 67% (40 to 94), and 94% (81 to 100) for CRP. The positive and negative likelihood ratios were respectively 67.3 and 0.13 for PCT and 16.7 and 0.51 for CRP. Maternal PCT serum level was negative in all cases. In the population with suspected nosocomial infection, 45 cases were defined as infected, 31 infections were proved by bacteriological cultures. Most of the proven infections were caused by coagulase negative staphylocoque (51,6%) and staphylocoque aureus (22,5%). With the cut off value of 0,5ng/ml, the sensitivity for diagnosis of bacterial infection was 91,3%, specificity 93,9%, positive predictive value 84%, negative predictive value 96%.

The area under the curve obtained for PCT in distinguishing between viral and bacterial infections was 0.82 (sensitivity, 65.5%; specificity, 94.3%; optimum cutoff, 0.53 ng/ml), whereas for CRP it was 0.78 (sensitivity, 63.5%; specificity, 84.2%; optimum cutoff, 27.5 mg/l). PCT and CRP values in invasive infections (PCT, 24.3 ng/ml; CRP 96.5 mg/l) were significantly higher than those for noninvasive infections (PCT, 0.32 ng/ml; CRP, 23.4 mg/l).

The data were used to evaluate the reproducibility of the clinical decision rule proposed by Oostenbrink et al [Acta Pediatr, 2000] aiming at predicting VUR using a risk score combining clinical (family history of uropathology, male gender, young age), biological (elevated C-reactive protein) and radiological (urinary tract dilation on renal ultrasound) variables.

Some methodological weaknesses (variables selection and cotation) may explain this lack of reproducibility [Leroy, Arch Dis Child, 2006]. Both in the single-center [Leroy, Pediatrics, 2005] and the multicenter European study [Leroy, in revision], the median value of PCT was significantly higher in children with vs without VUR: 1.6 vs 0.7 ng/mL (p &#x0003c;0.001). After dichotomisation around a 0.5 ng/mL threshold, there was a significant association between VUR and high PCT [OR=2.3, 95% CI 1.3&#x02013;3.9, p=0.001]. After logistic-regression adjustment for all potential confounders (young age, male gender, positive family history for uropathy, C-reactive protein, urinary tract dilatation on renal ultrasonography, urine technique collection &#x02014; sterile bags vs suprapubic aspiration or transurethral catheterization), the association remained significant (OR: 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4&#x02013;4.4; p=0.001). The strength of the relationship increased with the grade of reflux VUR grade (p &#x0003c;0.001).

Genetic polymorphisms in this immune response to infection can partly explain these differences and have been shown to be associated with clinical outcomes. Functional and association studies involving genetic polymorphisms in essential genes. These include specific and aspecific recognition of pathogen associated microbial patterns, signaling receptors like Toll-like receptors, primary and secondary inflammatory proteins like cytokines and chemokines, and coagulation and fibrinolysis factors These polymorphisms have provided important insights into the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced organ dysfunction. The advancement of high-throughput single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping will provide valuable information on the interaction of multiple allelic variants and clinical outcome. More precise categorization of patients based on genetic background is likely to lead to individualized targeted treatment. A specific example of pediatric sepsis is the meningococcal sepsis. The clinical presentation of infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis is highly diverse. Some patients develop meningitis, and others present with sepsis or even septic shock. Genetic differences might explain this diversity.

Justine, Research Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p>Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is characterized by a phase of arrest in vascular development associated with vasoobliteration, which is followed by an ischemic phase resulting in neovascularization. Major factors involved in vascular degeneration include a suppression in VEGF expression combined with a rise in reactive oxygen species and corresponding peroxidation products. On one hand, ischemia-induced retinal (rather than preretinal) neovascularization can be considered beneficial in salvaging the tissue. Yet, despite production of angiogenic factors and nitric oxide within ischemic tissues, compensatory ingrowth of new vessels fails to provide adequate vascularization. Thus, we hypothesized that local factors counter efficient revascularization via nitrosative stress related pathways. Along with hypoxia, ischemia also produces a concomitant elevation of CO2. In the developing subject, hypercapnia has been associated with the development of ROP in humans and confirmed experimentally. However, the significance of hypercapnia, particularly on neovascularization, has been relatively overlooked compared to the numerous studies on hypoxia. We investigated the mechanisms by which hypercapnia impair vascular development. We found that acute and prolonged CO2 exposures inhibit developmental neovascularization of the retinal vasculature, as well as revascularization of the ischemic retina. This was associated with increased eNOS, generation of highly reactive nitrogen species (including peroxynitrite) and downregulation of the pro-survival and angiogenic PGE2 receptor, EP3; VEGF and its receptors were not affected. NOS inhibitors as well as peroxynitrite decomposition catalyst FeTPPS prevented hypercapnia-induced vasoattenuation. Furthermore, we illustrate that in vitro CO2 results in a NO-dependent microvascular endothelial cell (EC) protein nitration and cell death. Mediators of nitrosative stress remain for the most part unknown. Trans-arachidonic acids (TAAs) are recently described major products of NO2&#x02032; radicalmediated isomerization of arachidonic acid, and their formation is enhanced by high CO2 levels; we explored if and how TAAs reproduce biological effects of nitrosative stress. TAAs are generated in our model of retinal microangiopathy in vivo in a NO-dependent manner. TAAs induced a selective time- and concentration-dependent cell death of ECs in vitro, and resulted in retinal microvascular degeneration ex and in vivo. These effects are mediated by an upregulation of the anti-angiogenic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), independently of classic arachidonic acid metabolism; accordingly, TAA-induced vasoobliteration was prevented by selective neutralizing antibodies to TSP-1 as well as to its receptor CD-36. In summary, our findings uncover previously undescribed mechanisms of 64 &#x02014; hypercapnia-induced cytotoxicity, specifically as it pertains to nitrosative stress in microvascular injury, and provide insight into therapeutic avenues in the management of disorders involving nitrosative stress such as ischemic retinopathies and possibly encephalopathies commonly encountered in the immature subject. Finally, the dogma regarding safety of hypercapnia may need to be revisited.</p></sec><sec id="Sec717"><title>Prevention of Retinopathy of Prematurity</title><p><bold>A Sola</bold>, A Schenkman, L Skolinck, M R Rogido</p><p>Mid Atlantic Neonatology Associates, Morristown Memorial Hospital, Morristown, NJ, USA</p><sec id="Sec718"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Oxygen was discovered more than 200 years ago and it has been administered to more infants in the world than any other neonatal treatment.

In many places, and even in the recent literature, there is a debate about using 21% O2 versus 100% or &#x02018;pure&#x02019; oxygen during resuscitation. This practice cannot be a correct practice for many infants, since it excludes or limits a more reasonable practice, a practice based on using an &#x02018;adequate&#x02019; dose of oxygen (anywhere from 21% to 100%), assessing each infant's needs with an accurate pulse oximeter, targeting for an &#x0201c;acceptable&#x0201d; SpO2 and using a blender to be able to administer the needed oxygen dose for that target. Measuring FiO2 and O2 saturation accurately with a state of the art monitor which incorporates new technologies can today be done routinely from the time of birth in preterm infants treated through out the world.

Of particular importance in this context has been the response of the smallest microvessels, the capillaries. OPS imaging illuminates the tissues with polarized green light and measures the reflected light from the tissue surface after filtering out the polarized portion of the reflected light. A clinical scoring system was developed to quantify images in septic patients (1). However OPS imaging was found to lacks sensitivity to study in detail capillary kinetics and morphology. We recently introduced SDF (Sidestream Dark Field) imaging as a new way of clinical observation of the microcirculation. In this modality a light guide imaging the microcirculation is surrounded by light emitting diodes (LED) of a wavelength (530nm) absorbed by the hemoglobin of erythrocytes so that they can be clearly observed as flowing cells. Covered by a disposable cap the probe is placed on tissue surfaces. The light from the concentrically placed LED's at the tip of the probe directly penetrate deep into the tissue illuminating the microcirculation. By not being in direct optical contact with the sensing central core of the probe no direct surface reflections interfere with the image of the microcirculation and remarkable clear images can be observed. The deeper sublingual arterioles as well as the glcocalyx lining of the endothelial cells can also be clearly observed. Improved image quality allows better computer automatic analysis of the images and the low energy requirement of SDF imaging further enhances its utility by allowing battery and/or portable computer operation. It is expected that SDF imaging will provide an improved imaging modality of the microcirculation in sepsis especially in pediatriatic patients 1.

Recent data implicate a critical function for hemoglobin and the erythrocyte in regulating the activity of NO in the vascular compartment. Intravascular hemolysis releases hemoglobin from the red blood cell into plasma (plasma cell-free plasma Hemoglobin), which is then able to scavenge endothelial derived NO 600-fold faster than erythrocytic hemoglobin, thereby disrupting NO homoestasis. This may lead to vasoconstriction, decreased blood flow, platelet activation, increased endothelin-1 expression (ET-1), and end-organ injury, and thus suggesting a novel mechanism of disease for hereditary and acquired hemolytic conditions such as sickle cell disease and cardiopulmonary bypass. In addition to providing an NO scavenging role in the physiological regulation of NO-dependent vasodilation, hemoglobin and the erythrocyte may deliver NO as the hemoglobin deoxygenates. While this process has previously been ascribed to S-nitrosated hemoglobin, recent data from our laboratories suggest that deoxygenated hemoglobin reduces nitrite to NO and vasodilates the human circulation along the physiological oxygen gradient. This newly described role of hemoglobin as a nitrite reductase is discussed in the context of blood flow regulation, oxygen sensing, and nitrite-based therapeutics.

To maintain homeostasis in the extensive and vulnerable mucosae, they are protected by specialized mechanisms of immune protection. Numerous genes are involved in the regulation of both innate (natural) and adaptive (acquired) immunity, with a variety of modifications introduced over million of years. Two-layered adaptive mucosal immunity: In the process of evolution, the mucosal immune system has generated two layers of non-inflammatory defence: (i) immune exclusion performed by secretory IgA antibodies to modulate or inhibit surface colonization of microorganisms and dampen penetration of potentially dangerous soluble factors; and (ii) suppressive mechanisms to avoid local and peripheral hypersensitivity to innocuous antigens, particularly food proteins and components of commensal bacteria. When induced via the gut, the latter phenomenon is called &#x02018;oral tolerance&#x02019;, which appears be a rather robust adaptive immune function in view of the fact that large amounts of food proteins pass through the gut, while overt and persistent food allergy is not so common. Neonatal immune adaptation: The neonatal period is particularly critical, both with regard to infections and priming for allergic disease. This is so because the mucosal barrier function and the immunoregulatory network are poorly developed for a variable period after birth, and successful neonatal immune adaptation to exogenous stimuli is crucial to health. Notably, mucosal homeostasis depends on appropriate microbial colonization as well as adequate timing and dose of foreign food proteins when first introduced in the diet. Dendritic cells are &#x02018;decision makers&#x02019; in the immune system when they perform their antigen-presenting function, thus linking innate and adaptive immunity by sensing the exogenous impact (e.g. conserved microbial molecular patterns) on the mucosa. A balanced indigenous microbiota is apparently required to drive the normal development of both mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and the secretory IgA system as well as mucosally induced tolerance mechanisms such as the generation of regulatory T cells. Moreover, the properties of dendritic cells also appear to be influenced by dietary factors such as vitamin A. Other dietary factors including lipids, particularly the polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids in fish oil, can likewise in several ways have a beneficial effect on the developing immunophenotype of the infant. The same is true for breast milk, which provides both immunoregulatory factors and secretory antibodies reinforcing the infant's mucosal barrier.</p></sec><sec id="Sec800"><title>Mechanism of Allergic Sensitization: the Hygiene Hypothesis</title><p>E Isolauri</p><p>Department of Paediatrics, University of Turku, Finland</p><sec id="Sec801"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>The hygiene hypothesis conceives the increase in atopic disease to be related to reduced exposure to microbes early in life.</p></sec><sec id="Sec802"><title>Methods</title><p>The Nutrition, Allergy, Mucosal Immunology and Intestinal Microbiota (NAMI) research group has evaluated the host-microbe interaction in performing studies on:

How the microbiota is originated, depends on genetics, mode of delivery, early feeding strategies and the hygienic conditions. The NAMI research group has provided evidence for an extended hygiene hypothesis. This unifying theory that early and constant microbial stimulus from the gut microbiota may outweigh that of occasional infections provides an explanation for the simultaneous increase of autoimmunity and inflammatory bowel disease (TH1 mediated) and allergic diseases (TH2 mediated). Specific strains of the healthy gut microbiota (probiotics) were shown to counter allergy by generation of anti-inflammatory interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor-beta produced by Tr1- and TH3 cells, respectively, which have a vital role both in suppression of TH2-induced allergic inflammation, induction of oral tolerance, and IgA production, an indispensable component of the mucosal immune defence. The probiotic effects in atopic disease have been attributed to restoration to normal of increased intestinal permeability and unbalanced gut microbiota, improvement of the intestine's immunological barrier functions, and reduced generation of proinflammatory cytokines characteristic of local and systemic allergic inflammation. Gut microbiota provide again maturational signals for the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, particularly for the IgA plasma cells, conferring the first line of host immunological defence. Probiotics have also been show to exert distinct effects on antigen transport, depending on the food matrix, for example the quality of protein in the diet. In a rodent model mucosal transport of degraded macromolecules has been found to be stimulated when Lactobacillus GG is administered together with unhydrolyzed protein, but reduced when administered with hydrolyzed protein. Such protein may thus stimulate the humoral immunity in the gut, but also affect on the induction of oral tolerance, as antigen degradation is an indispensable component in the acquisition of mucosal tolerance. Moreover, polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to affect the growth and adhesion of probiotics, and the protective effect of probiotics appear to evolve in joint action with the dietary intake of particular nutrients reducing the risk of allergic disease. These advances have prompted enthusiasm in the scientific community and food industry and have fuelled research activities currently focusing firstly on identification of specific strains with anti-allergenic potential, and secondly on the question how food matrix and dietary content interact with the most efficacious probiotic strains.</p></sec><sec id="Sec804" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Taken together, probiotic effects evidently act cooperatively with other nutritional compounds. In the future, the properties of specific probiotics, and their combinations, in an optimal food matrix, might be exploited in the development of specific prophylactic and therapeutic interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec805"><title>Change in Nursing Practice Starts with You!</title><p>W De Groot-Bolluijt</p><p>GrootBolwerk, Maasdijk, The Netherlands</p><sec id="Sec806"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Nursing is an innovative and dynamic profession. Since the early days of Florence Nightingale, nursing practice has changed dramatically in order to provide better care and improve the outcome of the patient's illness. The latest development in nursing is the change towards evidence based practice. Knowing the newest developments does not seem to be sufficient for making a change effective. Providing knowledge by education, training and symposia does often not have the required results. Change Management gives realization in different aspects necessary for implementing an innovation. The aim of this workshop is to present the Change Work Model to obtain practical skills for a successful implementation of innovations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec807"><title>Methods</title><p>The Change Work Model is based on concepts of various theories of change management and learning styles. In addition, unit culture and innovation techniques are also incorporated in this model. The assumptions of the concepts within the Change Work Model are based on the available literature and are connected within a framework in the set up of the Change Work Model. The model is based on the assumption that before implementing an innovation, nurses have to know the different aspects of change. How they experience there own role and learning styles, the culture of there working place and what they expect from innovation. After the explanation of the theory, the participants will work with checklists based on the different aspects with examples from daily practice. The Change Work Model will lead nurses to become aware of their own role and learning styles, recognise the impact of the organization's culture and to identify recommendations to implement change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec808" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>With the Change Work Model different aspects will be important for innovation towards the daily practice. Changing can not only be done through projects in the entire organisation. The workshop sustains working with changes on an individual level and makes the own role of the nurse clear. It also offers tools to work with in a team. As a result, nurses obtain a better understanding of the mechanics and processes involved in innovation. They can use the different aspects of change and this will help them to work on innovation and successful change. Consequently the patient will benefit from any quality improvement in nursing practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec809" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The Change Work Model guides nurses through a systematic process of change to implement innovations into practice. This model is based on a framework of change management theory, research and clinical experience. The Model is a practical guidance for the individual nurses and applicable in every unit regardless the unit culture. In the rapid changing world of PICU and NICU, nurses need to develop their practice and account for their roles in changing practice. The infants and children on the NICU and PICU will benefit from our attitude.

The first reports focused on elderly and in populations where the prevalence of diabetes is already high. The association with insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome was later extended to young adults and to prepubertal children. Our research programme is based on a large community-based cohort where all subjects were carefully selected on birth data and gathers 734 SGA subjects (birth weight &#x0003c; 10th percentile) and 886 AGA (adapted for gestational age) subjects (25 &#x0003c; BW &#x0003c;75 perc.) born 1971&#x02013;85. In these adults born SGA, we have reported a number of malfunctions of the adipose tissue persisting after puberty (22 yr. old) suggesting an abnormal adipose tissue which could participate to insulin-resistance and the metabolic syndrome : &#x02014; They show an excess of fat mass, preferentially abdominal, without obesity &#x02014; Insulin action on lipolysis is reduced and FFA release is not suppressed under physiological insulin concentrations &#x02014; An excessive lipolysis in response to catecholamines was observed by microdialysis of the abdominal adipose tissue &#x02014; Leptin levels show an impaired regulation during catch-up and are low in adults &#x02014; Adiponectin levels are low and the and insulin-sensitizing action is impaired. &#x02014; Pro12Ala of PPAR actually enhances IR in the SGA individuals whereas it shows a insulin-sensitizing effect in AGA's, attesting for a real interaction with the fetal environment. and this observation has been replicated in two independent cohorts At the same time the different features of MS (hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance) were manifested in these SGA subjects and were clustering around IR. However, the phenotype was mild meaning that the differences between the subjects born SGA and their pairs born adapted for gestational age (AGA) were indeed significant for all features but of low magnitude. As a matter of fact, the proportion of disorders of glucose tolerance was low but twice as high in SGA in comparison to AGA (3.8% vs 1.6%) and that of MS six fold higher (2.3% vs 0.4%). We hypothesize that the adipose tissue, which is a major target of fetal growth restriction, is a key-tissue responsible for the metabolic complications and that the process extends beyond the perinatal period and continues to evolve in adults.</p></sec><sec id="Sec821"><title>Controlled Trial of Early Low-Dose Hydrocortisone Treatment in Prevention of Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia in Preterm Infants: A Two-year Follow-Up</title><p>O M Peltoniemi, A Lano, K Nikolajev, M A Kari, <bold>M Hallman</bold></p><p>Department of Pediatrics, University of Oulu, Finland</p><sec id="Sec822"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Dexamethasone treatment is associated with increased the risk of cerebral palsy (CP) among VLBW infants.

These events were all caused by multiple introductions of animal viruses &#x02014; influenza A viruses and SIV of birds and non-human primates respectively &#x02014; into the human population. Besides these introductions causing major pandemics in humans, a large number of other virus infections have spilled over from animal reservoirs to humans or other susceptible species, resulting in considerable morbidity and mortality as &#x02018;virgin soil&#x02019; epidemics. The most recent examples in humans are the introduction of SARS coronavirus and influenza A viruses (H5N1 and H7N7) from the animal world, which caused global concern about their potential to be at the origin of new pandemics. Over the last decades there seems to be a dramatic increase in the emergence or reemergence of virus threats in humans and animals worldwide. A long list of exotic names like Ebola, Lassa, Rift-Valley, Crimea-Congo, Hendra, Nipah and West-Nile is the illustration of names of just some of the places associated with the origin of viruses that crossed the species boundary to humans, with dramatic consequences in the last ten years alone. Similarly, recent mass mortalities among wild aquatic and terrestrial mammals caused by previously known and newly discovered morbiliviruses, as well as outbreaks of hog cholera, foot-and-mouth disease and fowl plague among domestic animals, highlight this trend. Although improved detection and surveillance techniques, as well as increased media attention may have contributed to our perception of an increase in the incidence of outbreaks of virus infections, it is becoming more and more clear that major changes in our modern society increasingly create new opportunities for virus infections to emerge: a complex mix of changes in social environments, medical and agricultural technologies and ecosystems continues to create new niches for viruses to cross species boundaries and to rapidly adapt to new species. In combating this global threat, we should make optimal use of the new tools provided by the unprecedented advances made in the research areas of virology, molecular biology, immunology, epidemiology, genomics and bioinformatics. Serious investment in these areas in the future will not only be highly cost-effective but will also save many lives of humans and animals. In addition, better collaboration and coordination between all the stakeholders is urgently needed, to establish early warning systems and effective preparedness plans.</p></sec><sec id="Sec862"><title>Urogenital Symptoms During Pregnancy and Birth Weight: The Generation R Study</title><p><bold>L Duijts</bold><sup>1,2</sup>, V W V Jaddoe<sup>1,2,3</sup>, A Hofman1,<sup>3</sup>, H A Moll<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>The Generation R Study Group, Erasmus MC &#x02014; Sophia's Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands <sup>2</sup>Department of Paediatrics, Erasmus MC &#x02014; Sophia's Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands <sup>3</sup>Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Erasmus MC &#x02014; Sophia's Children Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands</p><sec id="Sec863"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Physician-diagnosed urogenital tract infections in pregnancy are associated with low birth weight and premature birth.

We previously demonstrated that ethanol enhances S. epidermidis biofilm production. Bacteriostatic 0.9% NaCl, water and heparin sodium solution used in hospitals, contain 0.9% &#x02212;1% benzyl alcohol as preservative.

Experimental and clinical studies show that following asphyxia, multiple inter-related pathophysiological processes that culminate in necrotic and apoptotic cell death occur over a prolonged period. Experimentally, hypothermia ameliorates these processes and reduces the severity of cerebral injury. Recently completed trials of treatment with moderate induced hypothermia following perinatal asphyxial encephalopathy confirm that clinically significant improvement in outcome is possible. When hypothermia will be used as standard treatment for all infants with severe asphyxia we are faced with several questions. Which early entry criteria do we use? How do we cool? Is head cooling or total body cooling best? Should this intervention only be applied in level III units or is there also a place for treatment in local hospitals? Temperature management after brain injury is important, in particular avoiding rebound hyperthermia which easily occurs when circulation is restored. Number needed to treat was 6 in the 2 large clinical trials published in 2005<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2</xref> meaning that 5 out of 6 children treated did not have an effect of hypothermic treatment.

Recent studies in brain tissue samples have shown that nonphysiologic oxygen levels play a key role in induction of apoptosis in the developing brain. As female preterm infants consistently revealed a better neurological outcome then males, estrogen is considered to be neuroprotective in the premature brain. Astrocytes appear to have a critical role in protection and survival of neurons in the brain. As one of the glial cell types they have a great potential for possible involvement in the mediation of estrogen neuroprotective effects.

It is the most frequent cause of bacterial pharyngitis. But it can also cause a variety of cutaneous and invasive infections, such as pyoderma, erysipelas, cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) and myositis, and other complications such as rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. Although the global burden of GAS infections it not known it has been described that at least 517.000 people die each year due to severe GAS infections, eg acute rheumatic fever and invasive infections. Therefore, GAS figures among the 10 major human pathogens worldwide, only clearly exceeded by HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and Streptococcus pneumoniae. GAS is a well known cause of severe infections and sepsis/shock in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with a reported mortality rate of 15&#x02013;25%. The wide range of diseases by GAS with varying severity has been postulated to be due to phenotypic variation in GAS. Differences in virulence factor productions, in ability to invade human epithelial cells and in secretion of high concentrations of exotoxins (A-B-C) are described. However, very recently the difference between a simple GAS pharyngeal disease and a more disseminated, severe disease, eg. Toxic Shock Syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis, is traced to mutations in two regulatory genes. A single mutation in a global two-component signalling locus, the so-called Control of virulence R/S (CovRS) system, alters expression of 10&#x02013;15% of the genes. The mutation in CovRS shifts the expression from a pharyngeal transcriptome (PTP) to an invasive transcriptome (ITP), which can result in more invasive disease in human and mice. By ongoing knowledge at the molecular and gene-expression level, it becomes more and more clear how bacteria interact with their hosts to cause a range of diseases that are associated with infection. As translational medicine, from laboratory to bedside (PICU), develops further it will be possible to treat patients in the future more directly at the molecular-level of their disease. Also the development of a vaccine against GAS is a possibility to reduce the colonisation of tonsils and eliminate the dreadful forms of streptococcal infections. In the mean time the treatment of invasive GAS infections includes management of the complications of sepsis, aggressive surgical debridement if a site of infection is identified and antibiotics for the underlying infection. GAS remains susceptible to beta-lactam antibiotics. However, clinical failures of penicillin therapy for streptococcal infections do occur. Therefore, Clindamycin is recommended in invasive GAS infections together with penicillin or a carbapenem. Infections with GAS are still an important cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in less developed countries, and its global importance has been under-estimated. By new developments in molecular and translational medicine in the near future it will be possible to improve outcome in GAS infections substantially.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1024"><title>The Incidence of Infections of Ventricular Reservoirs in the Treatment of Post Haemorrhagic Ventricular Dilatation</title><p><bold>A J Brouwer</bold><sup>1</sup>, F Groenendaal<sup>1</sup>, A van den Hoogen<sup>1</sup>, M Verboon-Maciolek{ur1}, P Hanlo<sup>2</sup>, K Rademaker<sup>1</sup>, L S de Vries<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Departments of Neonatology, <sup>2</sup>Department of Neurosurgery, Wilhelmina Children&#x02019;s Hospital, University Medical Centre Utrecht, The Netherlands</p><sec id="Sec1025"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Infants with a progressive posthaemorrhagic ventricular dilatation (PHVD) have been treated in our neonatal intensive care unit with a ventricular reservoir since 1992.

However, whether iNO therapy could improve long-term outcomes of premature newborns remains uncertain. We hypothesized that prolonged treatment with low doses of iNO would reduce the incidence of BPD without worsening brain injury.

These successes must be viewed in the context of the huge unmet challenges for which novel developments in vaccines can provide enormous benefits in the future. The challenge of providing improved or novel vaccines comes at a time when the rise in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance poses diabolical problems and the global spread of pathogens is increasingly facilitated by unprecedented population densities in megacities, rapidity of travel, complex food chains and the many natural and human-inflicted disasters that disrupt societal infrastructures.

In the modern era, the only viral vaccine with proven effect on AOM is the influenza virus vaccine. Both the inactivated and the live virus showed some effect, but since influenza virus has only a limited season yearly the effect on the overall OM rate is far from being remarkable. Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) b vaccine did not reduce OM since most Hi causing OM are nontypable (NTHi) and not Hib. The newly developed pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) have all been shown to reduce &#x0003e; 50% of the OM caused by the serotypes included in the vaccines, but some replacement with serotypes not included in the vaccines and non pneumococcal organisms was demonstrated to reduce the overall effect of pneumococcal vaccines. The effect of PCV on the reduction of recurrent OM, OM with effusion, the need for ventilation tubes and frequent visits for AOM has been suggested, and the real impact is still being studied. Aiming with PCV at those with established recurrent OM has proved disappointing. PCVs can reduce OM caused by antibiotic-resistant S. pneumoniae but the continued overuse of antibiotics is responsible for the increase in antibiotic resistance in non-vaccine serotypes. A newly developed PCV with an outer membrane protein for Hi (PnPD) is suggested to reduce also OM caused by Hi, but confirmation studies are needed.

These infections can be in the urinary tract, peritoneal cavity (appendicitis), oral cavity (periodontal disease) or be systemic suggesting transplacental passage for some of these infections. More commonly, however, microbes are believed to ascend into the uterine cavity from the lower genital tract. A maternal inflammation is induced with infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the chorioamniotic membranes and in the chorion plate of the placenta. Eventually, inflammatory cells accumulate also in the umbilical cord indicating a fetal inflammatory response. Indeed, a multitude of cytokines and chemokines accumulate in the cervicovaginal fluid, amniotic fluid and fetal blood and the levels exhibit an association with preterm delivery and neonatal morbidity. Except for treatment of urinary tract infections, antibiotic treatment of patients with bacterial vaginosis or those presenting with preterm contractions have not been successful in prolongation of pregnancy or in reducing neonatal morbidity. This could be due to 1. that preterm birth has multiple causes and, hence, only infectious-related preterm birth could be expected to respond to anti-microbial treatment. 2. Infection induces inflammation which is considered to be critical for induction of preterm birth and neonatal organ damage. Antibiotics may have to be combined with antiinflammatory therapies to be effective, e.g. progesterone and corticosteroids have both proved beneficial and they are both strong anti-inflammatory agents. 3. The infectious/inflammatory process starts early in gestation and treatment at the time of preterm contractions may be too late. Indeed, it has been shown that the presence of ureaplasma Urealyticym or increased cytokines in the amniotic fluid at midgestation predict late abortions/preterm birth. We hypothesize that such chronic &#x0201c;low-intensity&#x0201d; inflammation during pregnancy may be critical not only with respect to preterm birth but also to long-term CNS development, vulnerability and injury. Systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in adult animals induces upregulation of cytokines and activation of microglia in the brain, which was accompanied by a substantial decrease in CNS neurogenesis. High doses of LPS applied between the chorio-amniotic membranes in pregnant mice at embryonic day (ED) 15 (75% gestation) induces preterm birth. However, much lower doses of LPS at ED 15 does not induce preterm birth but elicits a chronic state of CNS inflammation and the animals develop more extensive brain lesions if later exposed to hypoxiaischemia during postnatal life (Wang et al. 2006). Furthermore, maternal LPS induces inflammation, hypomyelination and cell death in the brain of the postnatal offspring. Intrauterine infection causes preterm birth in a subset of patients. Clinical and experimental studies suggest that the inflammatory process starts early in gestation. The immuno-inflammatory activation during pregnancy may have programming long-term influences on CNS development and vulnerability.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1051"><title>Prevention of Inflammatory Damage &#x02014; Is A Double-Edged Sword Needed to Fight Hydra in Wonderland?</title><p>O Dammann<sup>1,2</sup>, P Gressens<sup>3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Perinatal Infectious Disease Epidemiology Unit, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany <sup>2</sup>Neuroepidemiology Unit, Children&#x02019;s Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA <sup>3</sup>UMR 676 and INSERM-Paris 7 and Service de Neuropediatrie, Hopital Robert Debre, Paris, France</p><p>Knowledge continues to accumulate from perinatal and neonatal inflammation research suggesting that each solution to a riddle in this field is accompanied by the appearance of (at least two) new ones. This reminds us of the mythical serpent Hydra, one of whose nine heads was immortal. The beast quickly grew two new heads for each one Hercules chopped off. Recent research suggests that inflammatory processes play a role in most, if not all, neonatal disorders of the brain, eye, lung, and gut. Moreover, systemic inflammation issues require close attention. We should not surrender to complexity, but take it as a stimulation to move ahead. The traditional view that the immune system&#x02019;s primary task is to maintain health by fending off &#x02018;non-self&#x02019; has been challenged by Polly Matzinger (Science, 2002), who suggests to give &#x02018;danger&#x02019; the role of the offender. Her model proposes that alarm signals from stressed tissues rather than specific forms of antigen define the design of the immune response. Although this theory might explain some non-self-tolerance phenomena rather elegantly, we are now obviously left with the task to identify and characterize the alarm signals proposed by the theory. Much of the danger theory revolves around the mechanisms of adaptive immunity (i.e., Tcell activation). Thus, we will need to clarify whether the innate immune response itself constitutes a danger signal, and how much of the danger signal we call &#x02018;inflammation&#x02019; causes damage in and of itself. Finally, we need to figure out how we can prevent the consequences of such danger. For those who consider adult medicine less than straight forward, fetal / neonatal medicine might look like Wonderland &#x02014; a strange world, where almost nothing is to be taken at face value and apparent paradoxes wait for us at every corner. Here are three rather simplistic examples: antenatal infection reduces postnatal respiratory distress, but increases the risk for longterm bronchopulmonary dysplasia (Watterberg et al, 1996); antenatal glucocorticoids reduce the risk of developmental disability, while neonatal glucocorticoids increase the risk (O&#x02019;shea &#x00026; Doyle, 2001); maternal, but not fetal, administration of steroids reduce growth (Newnham et al, 1999). In this presentation, we offer speculations about potential future developments in perinatal and neonatal care in order to begin planning preventive intervention. Much of the work that needs to be done involves concepts such as signal detection, characterization of danger, and intervention design. Extreme caution needs to be exerted when working on these issues, because inflammation might (in part) be beneficial. Therefore, anti-inflammatory strategies are likely to come from the armamentarium of double-edged swords. According to Greek mythology, Hydra was eventually killed only because Iolaus helped his uncle to chop off the immortal ninth head. Unfortunately, because Hercules had not managed to do it all by himself, the success was not counted towards his ten labors. Still, we believe that it will take exactly this kind of teamwork to eventually reduce the dangers brought to perinatal Wonderland by inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1052"><title>Hyperoxic Resuscitation Increases Oxidative Stress and Changes in Gene Expression</title><p><bold>R Solberg</bold><sup>1</sup>, J Andresen<sup>1</sup>, S Tunheim<sup>2</sup>, G I A Borge<sup>3</sup>, M Bjor&#x000e5;s<sup>4</sup>, B H Munkeby<sup>1</sup>, O D Saugstad<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Pediatric Research, University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway <sup>2</sup>Centre for Occupational and Environmental Medicine, University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway, <sup>3</sup>Norwegian Food Institute, As, Norway <sup>4</sup>Centre for Molecular Biology and Neuroscience, University of Oslo, Rikshospitalet University Hospital, Oslo, Norway</p><sec id="Sec1053"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Resuscitation at birth with pure oxygen is associated with long term detrimental effects.

[1] The diagnosis of bile acid pneumonia has been proposed on the basis of a causative role of bile acids (BA) [2]. Because hyaline membranes have been demonstrated in rabbits after tracheal instillation of BA [3] we hypothesized that abnormally high BA levels in ICP could reverse the reaction of phospholipase-A2 in the alveoli, leading to a lack of surfactant.

After birth, fluid secretion has to cease as any excess fluid in the alveolar space will hamper gas exchange. Furthermore, excess fluid must be absorbed out of the alveolar space (alveolar fluid clearance). This is one of the most important processes in the transition to extrauterine life, and continuously thereafter. Expression of fluid by the birth canal is of minor importance. Cell physiologic and animal studies have elucidated the transport mechanisms and carrier proteins involved. Sodium ions are taken up by alveolar type II cells, previously known as the producers of surfactant, through epithelial sodium channels located in the apical membrane, and are actively extruded into the interstitial space by Na, KATPases in the basolateral membrane. Water follows passively the resulting osmotic forces. The fluid is removed from the interstitial space by blood capillaries and lymph vessels.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1079"><title>Methods</title><p>In respiratory distress syndrome, impaired epithelial transport and increased epithelial leakage result in increased alveolar fluid content, leading to impaired gas exchange and surfactant inactivation. Clinical studies have shown that the survival of patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome is dependent on the activity of their alveolar fluid clearance.

The consequences of insufficient or excessive intake of macro- and micro-nutrients influence the outcome of pregnancy, and may also have long-term effects on the health of the child and the future adult. An optimal supply of all important vitamins and minerals is thus essential for pregnant women. Their requirements with respect to a number of vitamins and minerals are considerably higher than those of women who are not pregnant. As these additional requirements cannot always be satisfied by a normal diet &#x02014; even in societies with an abundance of food &#x02014; micronutrient deficiencies occur (hidden hunger), and since detailed individualised nutritional supply levels cannot always be verified, dietary supplements seem advisable for all pregnant women.

From Molecular Biology to Consciousness</title><p>J-P Changeux</p><p>Institut Pasteur, Paris, France</p><p>In the course of human evolution, the complexity of brain connectivity increasesd dramatically, while that of the genome did not change significantly. Several genetic mechanisms may plausible account for this paradoxical non-linear relationship such as the spatiotemporal and combinatorial action of developmental genes ie homeotic genes, microcephaly genes and/or several others. Alternatively, the state of activity (evoked/spontaneous) of the developing brain, during foetal life and in the newborn, may contribute to the development of brain organisation via &#x02018;epigenetic&#x02019; mechanisms such as the selective stabilisation/elimination of developing synapses. Still, such processes are expected to be limited by a &#x02018;genetic envelope&#x02019; which may include genes like those responsible for dyslexia, autism or fragile-X mental retardation. The mechanism of epigenesis by selective stabilisation of synapses was investigated using molecular biology techniques with the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR), the best known neurotransmitter-gated ion channel. Studies with mice deleted for defined subunits of the nAChR revealed a contribution of the spontaneous activity of the retina to the development of the adult visual pathways and maps. Moreover, the analysis of the transcriptional regulation of nAChR genes by electrical activity/neurotrophic factors during motor endplate morphogenesis established causal links between membrane electrical activity and nAChR genes promoters through transcription factors and second messenger pathways. In the brain, an efficient in vivo method involving the selective reexpression of defined genes by stereotaxic injections of lentiviral vectors is used to investigate the plasticity of adult brain circuits in cognitive learning. The importance of epigenetic regulation of synapse development (and its pathologies) in early learning processes, in cognitive and/or conscious functions and in cultural evolution, is discussed in the case of the development of the newborn infant and its pathologies such as autism, ADHD, sudden infant death disease.

Experimental models have improved our understanding of neuropathology and support a glutamate hypothesis of hypoxic-ischaemic brain damage. Substantial evidence indicates that antagonists of ion channel-linked glutamate receptors can reduce damage. In focal ischaemia, this is true for both N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists and for non-NMDA (kainate/AMPA) antagonists. In such models, the magnitude of infarct reduction is typically in the order of 25 to 30%. Moving away from the direct effect of the receptor, there are either upstream or downstream sites for drug action. For example, upstream, glibenclamide (acting at the ATP sensitive potassium channel) prolongs the period over which hypoxia can be tolerated. Alternatively, downstream, dantrolene (acting at the endoplasmic reticulum to limit NMDA-initiated, calcium-mediated, calcium release from the ER pool) limits the induction of apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1142"><title>Methods</title><p>To date, many pharmacological approaches, or combination of approaches, have been applied to animal models, with beneficial effects, which promise efficacy in patients.

Painful procedures are the principal memory in survivors of childhood cancer. However, also neuropathic pain and other forms of chronic pain affect a large number of children. Children with a variety of genetic disorders may develop chronic pain as their life progresses. The reasons for a low availability of data in children are widespread. The diversity and developmental range of the paediatric population have enormous implications for the design and conduct of clinical research and the interpretation of research findings. Inappropriate pain assessment is likely to be an important contributor to the poor pain management in children. The problem of differentiating postoperative pain from fear and anger in toddlers &#x02026;. Nursing and physician alike remain confused as to the dividing line between conscious sedation and pure pain management. The traditional definitions of pain require self-reporting: a contributing factor is the children&#x02019;s difficulty in expressing their pain to those taking care of them in a way that is understood. Behaviour is a useful measure and indicator of pain in neonates and infants and a behavioural pain assessment tool might be necessary. Whatever scale is used, it is important but frequently neglected to ensure that it is appropriate for the cognitive development, personality and condition of the child. Incorporating both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies is as necessary in children as in adults. Hardly any paediatric data are available on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of many drugs and are usually extrapolated from adult data. Recent but limited characterisation of the developmental pharmacokinetics of opioid analgesics, paracetamol and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs has however improved dosing in children. Oral solutions can now be used in neonates. Intravenous paracetamol offers increased dosing accuracy. Moreover, the paediatric population has access to unique formulations: the use of topical creams of a local anaesthetic, otic analgesia and rectal administration, although many children dislike the latter route.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1149" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>As it is recently recognised that pain and its management may have consequences for later pain-related behaviour and perception, all human beings have the right to adequate pain control whether they can self-report or not.

At last count, there were over 40 published assessment scales for measuring pain in infants and children in the hospital setting. While it has been generally recognized that pain is a complex multidimensional experience, attention in pediatric pain measurement studies has remained largely focused on pain intensity, to the exclusion of measuring the meaning of the pain and its affective and behavioral consequences. There are numerous tools for assessment of acute pain in infants, but few have been shown to be valid for assessment of persistent pain or postoperative pain in critically children. More worrying, there remains minimal integration of pain measurement with pain treatment. Pain intensity scores have been successfully used to demonstrate the efficacy of analgesics in clinical trials. However, none of the published assessment scales provide evidence for implementing one treatment versus another for any given pain score. Possibly as a consequence of that lack of evidence, there is low compliance with pain assessment documentation in many units that have implemented standardized scales. If the measurement of pain does not lead to a treatment decision, and the effectiveness of that decision is not demonstrated by a meaningful change in the scale, what is the utility of the measure? Recent research suggests that specific behavioral and physiological indicators are valid and reliable proxy measures for pain in non-verbal children. The best indicators may vary based on age, severity of illness, degree of neurological impairment, context and type of observer (healthcare professional or parent. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in discriminating pain-related signs of distress from other etiologies. Recommendations for pain assessment in preverbal children will be suggested based on current evidence.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1151"><title>Non-Pharmacological Pain Management in the Infant and Child</title><p>I Harth</p><p>PICU, Children&#x02019;s Hospital Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany</p><sec id="Sec1152"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Critically ill children and infants might experience a stay on a PICU with a lot of stressors which may cause pain, discomfort and suffering. Providing comfort to these patients is a core duty of the nursing profession.

This involves transfer of the ventilated patient from the intensive care unit to the scanning suite, with its antecedent risks. The aim of the study was to determine how frequently these CT scans showed abnormalities where surgery could have improved intracranial hypertension refractory to medical intervention, and if there were clinical parameters that could predict this.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1163"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a retrospective study of patients admitted to our tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with TBI requiring intracranial pressure (ICP) monitoring.

Most of these diseases manifest during (early) childhood and affect the nervous system more often than any other organ system. Early diagnosis is important because treatment, if available, may prevent acute metabolic attacks and mental retardation, epilepsy, severe brain damage, or death; and is also a prerequisite for optimal genetic counselling. The ideal classification of metabolic encephalopathies should be based on cause and pathogenesis. In a recent paper (Ref.: A. Simons, F. Eyskens et al. European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 2006) we reported on the intelligence scores and the psychiatric pathology of distinct groups of children with metabolic diseases. Based on this study I would divide the neurometabolic disorders roughly in different subgroups: the &#x0201c;intoxication group1&#x0201d; (including PKU, galactosemia, organic acidurias and urea cycle disorders), the &#x0201c;substrate and enzymatic disorders of energy metabolism group&#x0201d; (including glycogenoses, neoglucogenesis and fatty acid oxidation disorders that have hypoglycaemia in common), the &#x0201c;mitochondrial respiratory chain defects group&#x0201d;, the &#x0201c;storage disorders group&#x0201d; and the&#x0201d;deficiency disorders group&#x0201d;.

Diagnostic assessment included a semi-structured interview, self-report questionnaires and a standard intelligence test. Case reports of different metabolic diseases not included in the paper will be discussed: Nonketotic Hyperglycinemia, Canavan&#x02019;s Disease, peroxisomal disorders, lysosomal storage disorders, Smith-Lemly-Opitz syndrome, Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis, CDG syndrome, L-serine biosynthesis defects, disorders of creatine metabolism, folate receptor antibodies, pyridoxine dependency, and neurotransmitter defects. Besides functional disturbances, developmental structural brain defects, neuronal and glial cell loss, demyelination / leucodystrophy and stroke or stroke-like injury to the brain are common in metabolic diseases. NMR imaging of the brain can reveal specific abnormalities, e.g. Leigh syndrome and Canavan&#x02019;s disease, as well as aspecific abnormalities, e.g. corpus callosum agenesia/hypoplasia and neuronal migratory disturbances. Special extraneural abnormalities should be looked for: dysmorphic features, cardiac involvement, hepatosplenomegaly, skin disturbances,&#x02026;</p></sec><sec id="Sec1188" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In our study in 40% of the children older than 5 years, a child psychiatric diagnosis was made.

Two fifths of the children showed a below normal intelligence, while a performal-verbal IQ discrepancy was found in half of the children, especially in the &#x0201c;intoxication group&#x0201d;.

These adipocytokines are positively correlated only in AGA mothers (r=0.512, p &#x0003c; 0.02).

Moreover, the positive association between leptin and adiponectin levels observed only in AGA mothers could rather indicate that a compensatory mechanism is functional in AGA mothers to counteract the inflammatory state of parturition. This innovative finding may serve to predict outcome in pregnancies at risk. The pronounced leptin decline in IUGR from UC to N1 may result from combination of intrauterine stress, leading to higher fetal levels and decreased adipose tissue, resulting to lower extrauterine levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1215"><title>Serum Osteoprotegerin and Rankl Concentrations in the Perinatal Period: The Impact of Intrauterine Growth Restriction</title><p><bold>D Briana</bold><sup>1</sup>, A Malamitsi-Puchner<sup>1</sup>, D Gourgiotis<sup>2</sup>, M Boutsikou<sup>1</sup>, L Kontara<sup>1</sup>, A Marmarinos<sup>2</sup>, S Baka<sup>1</sup>, T Boutsikou<sup>1</sup>, D Hassiakos<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neonatal Division, 2nd Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Athens University, Greece, <sup>2</sup>Research Laboratories, 2nd Department of Pediatrics, Athens University, Greece</p><sec id="Sec1216"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>RANKL (receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;B ligand) belongs to the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) ligand family and is crucial for osteoclast formation.

Intravenous opioids (such as morphine and fentanyl) and benzodiazepines (such as midazolam) are the most used drugs for this purpose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid tapering off after long-term administration may lead to problems of tolerance, physiological or psychological dependence and withdrawal symptoms. The aim of this study was to describe the frequency of withdrawal symptoms and the correlation between total doses of benzodiazepine or opioids and withdrawal symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1267"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective study was performed in children admitted to the PICU of the Erasmus MC &#x02014; Sophia Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.

There are hardly any differences detected in the frequency of the 24 withdrawal symptoms between total dataset and the decrease group. The Spearman Rank Correlation coefficient (rs) for the relation between total doses of midazolam and maximum sum score (of the SBOWS) was 0.51 (p&#x0003c;0.001). The correlation between total doses of opioids and the maximum sum score was an rs of 0.39 (p=0.001).

Thus a large number of preventive, prophylactic or therapeutic strategies have been developed over the last 30 years to minimize the incidence of PDA and its potentially harmful consequences. Recent clinical trials and metaanalyses will be discussed concerning efficacy in closure of PDA as well as side effects of pharmacological treatment and long-term outcome variables.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1296"><title>Methods</title><p>Literature Review and Prospective Cohort Study in the Hamburg Ibuprofen Trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1297" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Ibuprofen (IBU) and Indomethacin (INDO) have been intensively studied for pharmacological closure of PDA. Metaanalyses and several trials have shown comparable efficacy for inducing closure of PDA in VLBW-Infants. Closure rates between 60 and 90% for VLBW infants and around 40&#x02013;60% for ELBW infants have been reported for early treatment of PDA. Acute side effects are favouring IBU, because it has less vasoconstricive potential especially for renal perfusion. The occurence of oliguria is significantly lower for IBU compared to INDO. Furthermore less influence on cerebral perfusion has been shown for IBU, thus avoiding cerebral vasoconstriction. Mesenteric blood flow is significantly lower after treatment with INDO. Two studies have raised concern about a higher rate of chronic lung disease (defined as the need for oxygen therapy at 28 days) for the IBU group. However these findings have not been reported by other groups, and pulmonary outcome at 36 weeks of gestation was not investigated, although this is far more clinically relevant. Optimal timing of treatment still remains controversial. INDO has been shown to reduce the incidence of severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), when used prophylactically during the first days of life. The rate of PDA and surgical intervention was also significantly lower. However long term outcome has been disappointing for the treatment group, showing no reduction of developmental deficit or infantile cerebral palsy. IBU as well has been investigated for prophylactic treatment. Incidence of PDA and surgical closure was also significantly reduced. There was no clear effect on IVH. One trial was stopped after occurrence of severe pulmonary hypertension in three patients. At the moment prophylactic use of INDO is questionable and of IBU is not recommended. Number needed to treat (NNT) for reduction of PDA surgery is 20 and for reduction of severe IVH 25, showing a high proportion of &#x02018;overtreated infants&#x02019; in the prophylactic regimen.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1298" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>IBU and INDO are both equally effective in pharmacological closure of PDA. IBU has significantly less acute side effects when used in an &#x02018;early therapeutic strategy&#x02019; e.g. from day 3 of life. Cerebral perfusion is not altered. Prophylactic use of both drugs is potentially harmful, especially for infants at low risk for development of hemodynamic relevant PDA. Pulmonary hypertension should be excluded prior to treatment with cyclooxigenase inhibitors. Our own treatment strategy derived from the Hamburg Ibuprofen study is presented.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1299"><title>Ibuprofen Treatment of Patent Ductus Arteriosus in Preterm Infant, Experience from Stockholm</title><p>S Johansson</p><p>Department of Woman and Child Health, Karolinska Institutet, Stockhom, Sweden</p><sec id="Sec1300"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Ibuprofen treatment of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was introduced at the Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden in 2001.

Short term closure was assessed by echocardiography 18&#x02013;24 hours after completed ibuprofen course. Surgical closure rate was assessed at discharge.

Relapses were also common in this group, due to septicemias. Final non-surgical closure rate ranged from 57% among 23&#x02013;24 week infants to 94% among infants born &#x02265;29 weeks.

The decrease in renal function was small but surveillance of renal function is indicated during ibuprofen treatment. Short term PDA closure with ibuprofen was achieved in most infants, but final non-surgical closure rate was low among infants born at 23&#x02013;24 weeks. Whether optimized ibuprofen treatment strategies, such as earlier initation of treatment, could decrease surgical closure rate among the most immature infants remains to be determined. The BPD rate of 44% was comparable to the rate among indomethacin treated infants in 1997&#x02013;1999 (45%).</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1304"><title>Ibuprofen, Bilirubin and Albumin: The Importance of a Balance</title><p>B Van Overmeire</p><p>Neonatology Unit, Department of Pediatrics, Antwerp University Hospital, Belgium</p><p>Ibuprofen at a dosing scheme of 10-5-5 mg/kg at 24 hour intervals is increasingly used as an alternative to indomethacin for the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus in premature infants. Because ibuprofen is highly bound to albumin it may interfere with bilirubin-albumin binding and increase the free fraction of bilirubin, augmenting the risk of bilirubin neurotoxicity.</p><p>A large interindividual variation in ibuprofen pharmacokinetics has been demonstrated in newborns. One hour after the first dose, ibuprofen plasma levels are reported to vary from 31 to 280 mg/L. Ibuprofen is mainly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 complex and more specifically by the CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 subfamily. Maturation of CYP2C increases fast after birth, reaching 30% of adult activity by one month of age. Ibuprofen clearance is highly variable among individual neonates and increases with advancing postnatal age. Ibuprofen serum half-lives decreased from 43 hours at age 3 days to 27 hours at age 5 days. Additionally, the pharmacokinetics may also be influenced by the presence of a ductal shunt. The volume of distribution changed more pronounced in infants with a closing ductus.</p><p>Ibuprofen is 95% bound to albumin and may interfere with bilirubin-albumin binding, thereby increasing the free fraction of bilirubin and induce a higher risk of bilirubin encephalopathy. High ibuprofen serum levels have been shown to have comparable displacing effects on free bilirubin as sulfizoxazole, a drug that has caused bilirubin encephalopathy in neonatal infants. Free bilirubin is superior to total bilirubin concentration in predicting the risk for bilirubin toxicity. The risk of inducing kernicterus depends on the concentration of ibuprofen, the binding constants of albumin for ibuprofen and bilirubin, and the bilirubin load at the moment when ibuprofen is administered. Albumin-ibuprofen binding is variable between neonates and probably also changes in time. On the first day after birth the biliubin pool is usually low, but increases steadily in the first week of life. In many neonatal intensive care units patent ductus arteriosus is preferentially treated when first signs of left to right ductal shunt develop, typically at the moment when the bilirubin pool is increased.</p><p>Several methods for the measurement of free bilirubin, or indirectly by the assessment of albumin binding, were developed. Recently an improved peroxidase assay has been developed with minimal serum dilution and two enzyme concentrations, yielding more accurate results.</p><p>In order to better understand the interactions between ibuprofen, albumin and bilirubin, the concentration of these molecules were analysed in plasma simultaneously with free bilirubin levels, before and after the administration of successive doses of ibuprofen in neonates of varying gestational and postnatal age with patent ductus arteriosus. The infants were followed-up after discharge and were screened for possible hearing deficits. No significant changes of free bilirubin concentrations were observed after the administration of ibuprofen. There was no correlation between these changes and the increase of ibuprofen levels. Free bilirubin increased inversely proportional to birth weight.</p><p>No clinical signs of bilirubin neurotoxicity could be detected in surviving infants.</p><p>First results seem to demonstrate that the risk of bilirubin encephalopathy is not increased after treatment with ibuprofen at a dosing scheme of 10-5-5 mg/kg, with peak levels below 60 mg/L and total bilirubin concentrations below 10mg/dL. However, when higher doses are applied in sick infants, the risk of kernicterus may markedly increase.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1305"><title>Clinical and Immunological Effects of the Long-Term Dietary Supplementation with a Probiotic Fermented Milk in Pre-School Children Allergic to Inhalants</title><p><bold>F Salvini</bold><sup>1</sup>, L Morelli<sup>2</sup>, A Ruscitto<sup>1</sup>, G Radaelli<sup>1</sup>, D Cattivelli<sup>2</sup>, C Agostoni<sup>1</sup>, M Giovannini<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Paediatrics, University of Milan, San Paolo Hospital, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>Microbiology Institute, Universit&#x000e1; Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Piacenza, Ital</p><sec id="Sec1306"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Probiotics may have immunomodulatory functions, exerting beneficial effects in allergic disease.

During the first few days of life, the alveolar surfactant pool size increases in size, reaching the controls within the first week.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1337"><title>Methods</title><p>Here we describe the approach how to define the genetic contribution to disease and discuss the polymorphisms some genes that associate with respiratory disease. The candidate genes studied thus far have been chosen on the basis of phenotype respiratory failure in lack-of-function mutations involving genes encoding surfactant proteins (SP) (SP-B, SP-C), on the basis of the regulatory role in the surfactant metabolism and in the host defense (SP-A), and on the basis of the established relationship to another generalized lung disease (G protein-coupled receptor for asthma susceptibility, GPR154 alias GPRA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1338" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The allelic variants of the genes encoding the surfactant proteins (SP) SP-A1, SP-A2, SP-B, and SP-C have been associated with RDS. Specific alleles affect different risk categories, as defined by the degree of prematurity, uterine size, or multiple pregnancy. The main SP-A haplotype, interactively with the SP-B Ile131Thr polymorphism and with constitutional and environmental factors, influence the risk. Case reports on mutations with partially functional SP-B have been published. The genetic susceptibility factors depend on the degree of prematurity at birth, consistent with sequential differentiation of the lung and gestationdependent differences in clinical presentation. According to recent report SP-C 138Asn associated with RDS in extremely preterm infants (Rova et al. Eur J Hum Gen 2004:12;312). In contrast, the near term infants with RDS may share the same susceptibility and protective GPRA haplotypes with asthma populations (Pulkkinen, Haataja, et al. Ann Med 2006 in press). The preferentially type 2 cell expressed genes involved in processing of the surfactant complex (such as ATPbinding cassette transporter 3, ABCA3) will likely serve as candidate genes in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1339" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>RDS associated with near-term and term births may have a different genetic predisposition and pathobiochemistry compared to RDS after very preterm birth.

On the child&#x02019;s part, this is an inevitable element for, as a minor, his/her interests are represented by the parent. As the child moves through adolescence, their right to privacy requires the exclusion of the parent from the confidential relationship, a process that is complicated by anything that impairs the child&#x02019;s autonomy (notably intellectual disability). Events such as abuse by the parents or parental psychiatric disturbance, mean that their can be so great a divergence between parental interests and the child&#x02019;s. If the child does not have the competence to be a full partner in the confidential relationship, the doctor may find that this is then with a proxy outside the family. B. On the doctor&#x02019;s part, good medical care increasingly requires a team approach by an ill-defined and variable group that is multidisciplinary and multiagency. The boundaries of these teams often are so diffuse and extensive as to be incomprehensible to a child and family. They extend to include not just the people the patient actually sees treating them but also laboratory and pharmacy staff and, linked I a more indirect fashion,. people such as the student and the administrator. The team may include people employed by other agencies &#x02014; notably teacher and social worker &#x02014; the discipline not necessarily being a guide to the employer. The difficulty is not only that different agencies have different concepts and thresholds of confidentiality but also that they have different reasons for their involvement; they have their own agendas. A concrete indicator of confidentiality is the circulation list for clinical letters for it indicates the boundary of confidentiality for that particular matter. Especially where it includes the patient (a practice recently introduced in England) for the practice defines the extent to which the patient has the authority to control the distribution of personal information. The letter also defines their status in relation to their parents &#x02014; are they addressed to the patient or to the parents &#x02014; as well as that of other professionals involved in their care. Certain issues regularly present the paediatrician with their own difficulties such as the pregnant minor who does not want their family to know, and the family in conflict (short of clear-cut child abuse) who do not want other agencies to be brought in. Child abuse brings its own particular problems where the paediatrician can find disclosure that is in his patient&#x02019;s best interests (to prevent further injury to the child) shifting to disclosure that is in the public interest (to prevent injury to other children). Although the determinant of the degree of disclosure is governed by the &#x02018;need to know,&#x02019; partial disclosure is not simple and, once the process has started, it can be very unclear as to who has what responsibility for continued confidentiality.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1369"><title>Privacy and Confidentiality in Children&#x02019;s Healthcare</title><p>P Thornton</p><p>Pear Tree Surgery, Kingsbury, Warwickshire, UK</p><p>It would be difficult to name a democracy in the Western World that pays less respect to confidential medical information than the United Kingdom.&#x0201d; It would be easy to dismiss such criticism if it hadn&#x02019;t come from such an authoritive source. Dr John Havard was speaking in 1989. He was then the secretary of the British Medical Association (BMA), a barrister as well as being qualified in medicine. In 2006, day in day out large numbers of patients divulge highly sensitive information to doctors and the information does not seem to leak out into the public domain. From the perspective of the doctor in clinical practice it is easy to assume that is no great problem with medical confidentiality. So was Havard wrong? Do patients with hold important information from clinicians? What has happened to standards, custom and practice in the interim? Does current practice meet the requirements of the Data Protection and Human Rights Acts? How will the migration to electronic records improve or diminish privacy for patients? At its Annual Representative Meeting in June, the BMA changed its policy. They now demand that patients should give explicit consent before information is transferred on to the national database &#x02014; an &#x0201c;opt-in&#x0201d;. Connecting for Health are recommending that information be transferred to the national spine having simply informed patients by leaflet of the database proposals. They regard it as sufficient to give patients the facility to &#x0201c;opt-out&#x0201d;. But the &#x0201c;opt out&#x0201d; they are offering is simply the use of software safeguards to block the sharing of information via the database. It remains their intention that &#x0201c;People should not be offered the choice to opt out of recording their healthcare data on National Care Records service.&#x0201d; And this is against a the background of connecting for health documents which confirm that the software safeguards on offer &#x02014; metaphorically dubbed &#x0201c;sealed envelopes&#x0201d; &#x02014; are not yet written and tested, will not be available in time for the initial proposed uploads of summary information from GP systems, will never work in respect of scanned images of correspondence and can be over ridden, contrary to the wishes of the patient. Conflated with all of this we have the proposed national Identity register and the two children&#x02019;s registers by which information about children and their parents will be required to be shared.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1370"><title>Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: Impact of Prevenar in North America</title><p>J D Kellner</p><p>Alberta, Canada</p><p>The 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7, Prevenar) was licensed and recommended for routine use in all infants and high-risk children in the USA in 2000 and in Canada in 2001.

Data from post-licensure studies will be presented that show Prevenar has been highly effective to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease in vaccine recipients. Data will also be presented to show the large indirect effect (herd immunity) in unimmunized children and adults. Overall, more than 2 cases of invasive pneumococcal disease are prevented indirectly for every case prevented directly. Another benefit of Prevenar has been a reduction in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant pneumococcal infections.

Almost all children in developed and developing countries acquire their first episode of rotavirus-induced infection before their fifth birthday. Although &#x0003e;80% of deaths due to rotaviruses occur in children in developing countries significant morbidity and occasional deaths occur in developed countries. Examination of rotavirus-induced annual hospitalisation incidence from several industrialized countries demonstrated a median rate of 445 per 100 000 children. The spectrum of symptoms that rotaviruses induce ranges from mild, watery diarrhoea of limited duration to fever, profuse diarrhoea and frequent vomiting that may result in severe dehydration leading to electrolyte imbalance and possibly death. It is difficult to predict which child will develop severe disease and complications to rotavirus-induced infections in industrialized countries are poorly quantified. Rotavirus is a well-known cause of community-acquired diarrhoea but it is less well recognized as a major cause of nosocomial infection in children although it is found consistently to be one of the most common causes of hospital-acquired diarrhoea. Two proteins of the outer capsid (VP4 and VP7) induce neutralizing antibodies and are used for genotyping, G-typing (the glycoprotein VP7) and Ptyping (the protease cleaving protein VP4). Due to the segmented nature of the rotavirus genome (consisting of 11 segments of dsRNA) rotaviruses can reassort during infection with multiple virus strains. Rotaviruses have been detected in many species of wild and domestic animals. Theoretically &#x0223c;110 reassortments are possible but it has been shown repeatedly in studies from different parts of the world that G1, G2, G3, G4 and G9 contribute to &#x0003e;95% of all rotavirus-induced diarrhoea. It will be difficult to eradicate rotaviruses this is why a reasonable goal for rotavirus vaccination is to eliminate severe disease and hospitalization and decrease the total number of rotavirus-induced infections.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1372"><title>Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis: Time for Vaccination!</title><p>F Gimenez-Sanchez</p><p>Advisory Committee of Vaccines, Spanish Association of Pediatrics, Paediatric Infectious Diseases, Torrecardenas Hospital, Almeria, Spain</p><p>The availability of rotavirus vaccination to reduce Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis (PRG) burden in Europe has stimulated efforts to characterize the real burden of rotavirus. It is estimated that PRG results in relatively few deaths per year in Europe, however, nearly every child in Europe is infected with rotavirus by age 5 years and the majority will have gastroenteritis, resulting in about 2.8 million cases cared at home, 700,000 outpatient visits and 87,000 hospitalisations. A prospective, observational study (REVEAL) conducted in seven study areas (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Sweden, UK) between October 2004 to September 2005 confirmed the high burden of rotavirus infections in Europe: 95% of PRG cases were in children above 6 months of age with more than 50% of hospitalisations and emergency department visits due to PRGE. The mean duration of hospitalisation varied between 2.5 to 5 days with at least one parent who had to miss work in 66% of families with a hospitalised child. In addition to causing morbidity and mortality in children, Paediatric Rotavirus Gastroenteritis creates a major economic burden on health care systems and families in Europe. Recent study (REVEAL) found that five globally common rotaviruses serotypes (G1,G2,G3,G4 &#x00026; G9) represent more than 98.5% of the circulating rotavirus strains in Europe. Almost two decades ago, studies demonstrated that rotaviruses serotypes (G1,G2,G3,G4) were predominant with an emerging novel rotavirus type: G9. To effectively reduce Paediatric Rotavirus Burden, a rotavirus vaccine should have demonstrated its efficacy against those five predominant rotavirus serotypes. Despite the significant morbidity and costs associated with Rotavirus in Europe, there is always a need to raise awareness of the rotavirus disease among European physicians and policy-makers in order to help the decision-making process about recommendation and use of rotavirus vaccination in each country. In industrialised countries, if widely used, rotavirus vaccination could substantially reduce the number and associated costs of child hospitalisations and clinical visits for acute diarrhoea as well as office visits and burden on the family.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1373"><title>Rotateq&#x000ae;: Ensure Successful Vaccination</title><p>P Heaton</p><p>Merck Research Laboratories, USA</p><p>The pentavalent human-bovine (WC3) reassortant rotavirus vaccine (RotaTeq&#x000ae; &#x02014; Merck &#x00026; Co., Inc.) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency earlier this year, with registration and/or filing in multiple countries. The vaccine, which is provided in a ready-to-use liquid formulation, was demonstrated to be generally well tolerated and efficacious in Phase III studies conducted in 11 countries worldwide, preventing 98% of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis and reducing rotavirus-related hospitalizations and emergency visits by 95%. Reductions in rotavirus-related health care contacts were comparable across geographic regions and across different serotypes including G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8]-containing G9 strains. The vaccine did not show evidence of an increase in intussusception and was well tolerated with respect to other adverse experiences of special clinical interest for rotavirus vaccines, including fever, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Mean antithrombin activity was statistically significant increased in chylous samples (32.2&#x000b1;11.4%) compared to non-chylous samples (14.4&#x000b1;13.9), and significantly decreased in plasma of children with chylothorax (44.6&#x000b1;15.4%) compared to children with non-chylous pleural effusion (69.9&#x000b1;22.4%).

The formula fed infants had lower calprotectin levels at day 30 than those breastfed (p=0.01), and the initial rise in calprotectin level from day 4&#x02013;10 was lower in the infants delivered by C-section compared to those delivered vaginally (p=0.009), also when stratified according to mode of feeding (p=0.022). A stratified analysis among the infants delivered by C-section demonstrated a lower fecal calprotectin average between day 10 and 30 in the formula versus breast fed group (p= 0.013). An effect of formula feeding in the infants delivered vaginally (7/160) could not be calculated because of too small numbers included so far.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1652" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The initial increase in calprotectin level has previously been reported and may reflect increased migration of neutrophile granulocytes into the gut lumen as an early immunologic adaption to the first bacterial colonization.

It is expressed by trophoblast cells and its preferential binding substrate is phosphatidylserine. As the gamete is fertilized, the trophoblast expresses phosphatidylserine for binding to the endometrial surface. In the normal embryo, annexin V binds to phosphatidylserine as a protective anticoagulant mechanism. In women with recurrent fetal losses, placental annexin V is decreased.

This study aimed to investigate visfatin levels in full-term intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR- below the 10th customized centile) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses (UC) and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4) postpartum, as well as in their mothers (MS) before delivery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1890"><title>Methods</title><p>Blood serum visfatin levels were measured in 20 IUGR and 20 AGA mother-infant sets by enzyme immunoassay.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1891" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>N1 and N4 visfatin levels were significantly higher in IUGR compared with AGA neonates (p=0.011 and p=0.026, respectively). In the AGA group, a positive correlation was demonstrated between N1 visfatin levels and infant centiles (r=0.452, p=0.045); additionally, a similar correlation was found between N4 visfatin levels and infant centiles, as well as birth weight (r=0.455, p=0.044, and r=0.558, p=0.011, respectively). Finally, in the IUGR group, a negative correlation was documented between MS visfatin levels and infant centiles (r=&#x02212;0.643, p=&#x02212;0.002).</p></sec><sec id="Sec1892" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Insulin resistance in IUGR neonates could possibly explain high N1 and N4 visfatin levels. The strong association between visfatin levels and centiles in AGA neonates could be attributed to its production in adipose tissue. Pathology in pregnancy, leading to IUGR, could also be responsible for maternal visfatin levels.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1893"><title>Automatic Identification of Clinically Significant Changes in The Vital Signs of Neonates</title><p><bold>J Quinn</bold><sup>1</sup>, C K I Williams<sup>1</sup>, B Wefers<sup>2</sup>, N McIntosh<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK, <sup>2</sup>School of Clinical Sciences and Reproductive Health, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK</p><sec id="Sec1894"><title>Backgroundand Aims</title><p>Alarms in a neonatal intensive care unit are triggered by vital signs measurements crossing preset thresholds.

Eight test periods of monitoring data, 1&#x02013;3 hours in duration and containing different types of physiological change, were taken from 4 infants.

Since with the exception of the foetal end the umbilical cord lacks innervation, we hypothesised the presence of specialized pacemaker cells in the wall of the umbilical vessels that might contribute to the coordinated function of smooth muscle cells. C-kit protein is considered to be a specific marker for pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal tract, known as interstitial cells of Cajal (ICCs) and c-kitimmunoreactive pacemaker cells have recently been discovered in the rabbit portal vein.</p></sec><sec id="Sec1925"><title>Methods</title><p>C-kit antibody was used on paraffin and on ultrathin sections of umbilical veins obtained from normal-term vaginal deliveries.

It is likely that intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is also connected with the attack of free radicals. We presumed that IUGR is a consequence of a foetomaternal blood flow disorder. Red blood cells (RBCs) have specific properties, which enable them to reach all tissues. The membrane structure is developed to result in a special shape and elasticity. If the integrity of the membrane is damaged, RBCs lose this shape and elasticity and may undergo haemolysis. Consequently, the tissues obtain less oxygen and nutriment.

Vascular study showed involvement of celliaco trunk and upper mesenteryc artery and drainage by dilated suprahepatic left vein. The tumor was completely removed surgically. It was necessary to resect the left hepatic lobe and transverse colon. Macroscopy view showed a gray-red exophytic tumor and an arterio-venous malformation.

Patients with small lesions don't need treatment, but those with big size tumors or symptomatic require aggressive management with surgical or medical treatment (steroids, alpha-interferon or vincristine).

Despite the benign histological findings of these tumors, some hemangioendotheliomes can develop malignant behaviour, so a long term follow-up is important for the evolution of treatment response.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2133"><title>Audit of Trisomy 13 and 18 Cases Over a Ten Year Period in Ireland</title><p><bold>N Ni Shuibhne</bold>, R Howell, A J Green, S A Lynch</p><p>The National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Dublin, Ireland</p><sec id="Sec2134"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>In Western Europe the majority of cases of trisomy 13 and 18 are detected antenatally through routine anomaly ultrasound screening.

He started therapy with albumin, furosemid, aspirin, captopril, levotiroxine, calcium carbonate, D vitamin, imunoglobulin infusions and erythropoietin. At 2 month the renal biopsy confirmed Finnish type nephrotic syndrome and began indometacin. Because of arterial hypertension, he was medicated with losartan and nifedipine. At 3 month, he presented with respiratory distress, seizures, multiorgan failure and coma. Of the laboratorial analysis we emphasize severe metabolic acidosis and ammonia &#x0003e;1000 ug/dl. The child started peritoneal dialysis and was medicated with arginine, carnitine, phenylbutyrate and benzoate. Metabolic defect workup: increased urine and plasma argininosuccinic acid levels, increased plasma citrulline levels and diminished plasma arginine levels.

In 24 infants (mean: 760 g, 25.5 weeks) serial echocardiography were performed on 1,2,3,7 postnatal days, and when PDA was clinically suspected. The diameter of ductus arteriosus (DA) was assessed, and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) was estimated (velocity of tricuspid and pulmonary insufficiency, pulmonary acceleration time, direction and velocity of ductal shunting). PDA treatment was indicated when clinical or echocardiographic signs of volume overload were present. We collected data on presence of IVH grade IIV and BPD.

Thirty-seven children completed the write-and-draw task. Analysis showed children actively construct their understanding of genetics, gathering information from various informal sources.

Thirty infants (61%) subsequently received ECLS. Of the 49 infants transferred 86% (n=42) survived to discharge. No clinical or laboratory factors were identified that significantly predicted survival. In particular, indices of oxygenation at the time of referral (OI r=0.04, p=0.76; FiO2 r=0.10, p=0.94), base hospital blood gas parameters and arrival blood gas parameters did not predict survival.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2631" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Numerical predictors of illness severity, such as the OI, are poor determinants of survival following ECLS.

On closer questioning the parents reported that during their holiday in Spain one week previously, Spanish hospital prescribed paracetamol (fig1) containing 100mg/ml to control the pyrexia. As the written instruction and the explanation of the dosage were in Spanish, the parents did not understand clearly. They had therefore been giving 5 ml of Spanish concentrated paracetamol assuming that it contained only 120 mg. This child weighed 10.4Kg; therefore he was receiving nearly 300mg/Kg/day of Paracetamol.

Previously we demonstrated increased TLR4 expression and IL-8 release following LPS stimulation in neonates compared to adults. However, the role of TLR4 and CD14 in LPSinduced cytokine release is not clear. Aim: To investigate CD14 expression and the role of TLR4 and CD14 in LPS-induced IL-8, TNF-alpha and IL-10 release in neonates.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2993"><title>Methods</title><p>Peripheral blood from 15 preterm, 15 full term neonates and 15 adults was cultured with LPS.

Cytokine release was assayed by ELISA.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2994" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Neonates exhibited increased CD14 expression following LPS stimulation, as compared to adults. Blocking of TLR4 inhibited LPS-induced IL-8 release significantly more in preterms (38%) than in adults (14%). CD14 blockade resulted in an even greater inhibition (80%) on IL-8 release, similar in all groups. Blocking of both TLR4 and CD14 did not result in a further increase in the inhibition of IL-8 release. TLR4 blockade inhibited (60%) LPS-induced TNF-alpha and IL-10 release, while CD14 blockade completely inhibited (100%) TNF-alpha and IL-10 release in all groups.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2995" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Preterms appear to dependent more on TLR4 for IL-8 release than adults. CD14 is critical for LPS-induced IL-8, TNF-a and IL-10 release, whereas the role of TLR4 is less prominent, suggesting that other TLRs are also involved. LPS-induced IL-8 release depends not only on CD14 and TLR4 signalling but also on other immune receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec2996"><title>Cytokine Induction by Streptococcus Pneumoniae: Polysaccharide Capsule Impedes TLR-Dependent Cytokine Production</title><p><bold>C Neeleman</bold><sup>1</sup>, T Sprong<sup>2</sup>, R Petru<sup>1</sup>, M van Deuren<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Pediatric Intensive Care, Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>Department of Internal Medicine, Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands</p><sec id="Sec2997"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Despite advances in critical care, morbidity and fatality rates of invasive pneumococcal disease remain high.

In PM of TLR2-deficient mice, cytokines by the WU2 strain were reduced to baseline levels, whereas significant production was seen by the capsule-negative DW3.8.

Even in previously healthy infants/children &#x02014; in the absence of antibiotic-resistant streptococcal species (due to increasing penicillin resistance or intermediate susceptibility) &#x02014; a rapidly evolving picture of sepsis and septic shock may occur. Emergency physicians and intensivist should be aware of these uncommon complications, needing a complex physiopathological support besides antimicrobials. In our experience, only a highly individualised approach permitted to achieve a significant improvement of the patient clinical status.

Diagnosing meningococcal septicaemia is simple when it presents with classical signs, especially the purpuric rash. However, meningococcaemia may present as a febrile illness mimicking common childhood illnesses. In these circumstances, misdiagnosis results in significant morbidity or death. This study assesses the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin in the setting of meningococcal disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3048"><title>Methods</title><p>Clinical and laboratory data in two emergency department cohorts (A and B) were analysed between 2002 and 2005, within New Zealand's serogroup B epidemic.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3049" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Cohort A consisted of 84 children (&#x0003c;14 years old), with confirmed MCD. Cohort B consisted of 1003 consecutively recruited emergency department febrile children, with 18 cases of MCD diagnosed. Within the MCD cohort (cohort A), the procalcitonin geometric mean was 21.6ng/mL. The overall sensitivity of procalcitonin, using a 2.0ng/mL cut-off (as defined by the ROC analysis in cohort B), was 0.96 (95% CI 0.90-0.99). Procalcitonin was correlated with whole blood meningococcal load (r=0.47) and Glasgow Meningococcal Sepsis Prognostic Score (r=0.42). Mean whole blood meningococcal load was 3.7 Log10 cfu/mL. Within the febrile presentation cohort (cohort B) the specificity of procalcitonin in MCD was 0.84 (95% CI 0.82&#x02013;0.86), positive and negative likelihood ratios were 6.0 and 0.05 respectively, and sensitivity was 0.94 (95% CI 0.73&#x02013;0.99).

Up to age 2 both groups had similar rates of GP contacts despite preterm children having more frequent hospital outpatient visits (most frequently for neurodevelopmental follow-up) and hospital admissions, After age 2 the GP visits became significantly higher in the preterm children (p&#x0003c;0.001). Respiratory diagnoses were significantly higher in the very preterm children for admissions and GP visits &#x0003e;2 years. Ophthalmology, otolaryngology and orthopaedics were the predominant surgical specialties accessed as outpatients and inpatients particularly after age 2. From age 2 years hospital admission continued to be significantly higher in the preterm (p&#x0003c;0.001).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3285" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Babies born very preterm have more frequent GP and outpatient visits and hospital admissions up to age 4 years. Compared to age &#x0003c;2, respiratory illnesses have reduced as reason for hospital admissions but increased as reason for GP visits in the preterm group. Surgical specialties were used more frequently at age 2&#x02013;3 years. These findings confirm the high health utilisation of very preterm infants to age 4.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3286"><title>Prenatal Betamethasone Has No Effect on Renal Drug Clearance in the First Month of Life</title><p><bold>K Allegaert</bold><sup>1</sup>, J N van den Anker<sup>2</sup>, A Debeer<sup>1</sup>, N H Holford<sup>3</sup>, G Naulaers<sup>1</sup>, B Anderson<sup>4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neonatal Intensive Care Unit, University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium, <sup>2</sup>Departments of Paediatrics, Pharmacology and Physiology, George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Washington, DC, USA, <sup>3</sup>Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand, <sup>4</sup>Department of Anaesthesiology, University of Auckland, New Zealand</p><sec id="Sec3287"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>There is conflicting evidence on the effect of prenatal betamethasone administration on renal drug clearance [1, 2].

In adult patients however, tube placement errors are common, with tubes being positioned in the esophagus, the intestines, and the respiratory tract. Incidentally even perforations into the pleural space are mentioned. Errors may occur both during insertion and due to migration over time. In neonates only few studies on tube placement were performed. Improper positions were mentioned in 38% to 55% of cases (Weibley et al., 1987). With regard to patient safety, these are alarming numbers. To establish the validity of these figures for our own NICU, we conducted a retrospective study of tube position on X-rays in a one-year patient cohort.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3354"><title>Methods</title><p>The first available X-ray from all NICU patients with visible nasogastric tube position admitted through 2005 was reviewed.

Meconium, a highly viscous substance, causes small airway obstruction leading to airtrapping and atelectasis, in addition to effects of local inflammation. Meconium contains gastrointestinal secretions, cellular debris and proinflammatory factors. DNA could contribute to the viscosity of meconium, analogous to the situation in sputum in cystic fibrosis patients. RhDNase treatment of these patients induces mucolysis and improves airway patency. Meconiumlysis based on DNA degradation may create new therapeutic approaches in newborns with MAS.

After the alert launched by the hospital, the local health authorities started a community intervention with the involvement of Town Hall, local schools and a non-governmental agency. In January 2006 a vaccination programme was initiated in the gipsy community and in the local school. The programme occurred in 3 stages because 1 new case was found after the first stage and other case after the second. In the local school, HAV vaccines were given to 71 (100%) children and 14 (78%) employees. In the community 197 (71%) children were vaccinated. The global coverage was 79%. The outbreak was successfully controlled.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3581" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The notification of some infectious diseases like HAV infection is obligatory in Portugal. This is very important in public health because it can allow fast and effective measures to outbreak control.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3582"><title>Rotavirus Acute Gastroenteritis: Clinical Burden and Predictors of Severity in A Pediatric Emergency Department</title><p>S Callegaro, <bold>G Rossi</bold>, B Andreola, M Perin, N Mainini, L Da Dalt</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, University of Padova, Padova, Italy</p><sec id="Sec3583"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Rotavirus gastroenteritis still causes clinical and social burden in all developed countries, but Italian epidemiological data are old and inaccurate. Our aims therefore were to evaluate the impact of acute gastroenteritis in children &#x0003c;5 years, in terms of access to a Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) and hospitalization; to compare epidemiologic and clinical characteristics of rotavirus related gastroenteritis to those caused by other pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3584"><title>Methods</title><p>This is a one-year prospective observational study, including children &#x0003c;5 years, admitted with community acquired gastroenteritis to our PED. Demographic, clinical, socio-economical data were collected; rotavirus was detected by an immunocromatographic rapid stool test. We performed descriptive two-variable analyses to compare rotavirus and non-rotavirus gastroenteritis and a multiple logistic regression for predictors of hospitalization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3585" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Annual access rate to our PED due to acute gastroenteritis resulted 4.1/100 inhabitants &#x0003c;5y; 46,9% of them were infected by rotavirus. Annual rate of hospitalization was 5,2/1000, with rotaviral positivity of 56%. In comparison to other pathogens, rotaviral infection was associated with higher clinical severity (number of daily diarrheic episodes, number of vomiting, level of fever, severity of dehydration, metabolic acidosis, ketonuria). At the multi-variable analysis, predictors of hospitalization resulted age &#x0003c; 3 months (OR=70.89) and presence of moderate-severe dehydration (OR=3.87).</p></sec><sec id="Sec3586" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In our area rotavirus gastroenteritis represents an important cause of admission to PED and of hospitalization, with higher severity in respect to other pathogens. These results can be useful in planning strategies of prevention and of active immunization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3587"><title>Outbreak of Measles in West Athens</title><p>A Vontzalidis, <bold>P Korovessi</bold>, K Avgeri, M Psalti, T Poukoulidou, I Papadea, E Papadakis</p><p>Department of Pediatrics, Thriasion General Hospital, Athens, Greece</p><sec id="Sec3588"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Measles continues to be a menace to millions of children worldwide. Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has set up a number of programs to reduce measles mortality worldwide by 50% by the end of 2005. The last 25 years 4 major outbreaks of measles occurred in Greece, last being on 1996.

All cases had no record of receiving any measles vaccine. All children were from a racial/ethnic minority (gypsies), having parents with low educational status, and belonging to a very poor household. Serological analysis (measles specific IgM) was carried out on 10 patients blood samples. Urinary and saliva samples of these patients were also tested for measles virus by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

The median age was 2.5 years. Fifty-four percent of admissions were male. There were 6 deaths, (mortality 5.7%). Detailed information was available for 102 patients. Of these, 17 suffered predominantly meningitis and 79 predominantly septicaemia, 6 had mixed disease. Ninety-two children required mechanical ventilation, 74 required inotropes and 14 required haemofiltration. Eighty-four percent of survivors had no lasting morbidity. Compared to the group that died or survived with disability, intact survivors had significantly lower mean (SD) PRISM score 11.9 (6.5) vs. 19.9 (8.2), p&#x0003c; 0.001, Glasgow Meningococcal Septicaemia Prognostic (GMSP) score 5.4 (2.7) vs. 8.2 (3.6), p&#x0003c;0.001 and Platelet-Neutrophil product 2,156 (2,038) vs. 884 (1,133), p &#x0003c;0.01.

Disturbances of cerebral blood flow play an important role in the pathogenesis of intraventricular haemorrhage and periventricular leukomalacia.

There was an increased risk (RR, 95% CI) of death or disability associated with an elevated lymphocyte count (5.26, 1.48&#x02013;12.85), seizures or encephalopathy (5.38, 1.54&#x02013; 8.44), shock (6.80, 2.22&#x02013;8.95), abnormal neurological signs (8.82, 3.10&#x02013;14.56), readmission to PICU (4.31, 1.36&#x02013;8.41), intubation/ventilation (14.43, 3.64&#x02013;31.24), and receiving inotropes (14.33, 1.73&#x02013;16.41) or nitric oxide (8.80, 3.50&#x02013;10.98).</p></sec><sec id="Sec4099" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Apnoea and paroxysmal cough are key symptoms in those with shorter cough duration.

The chest x ray was characterized by aspiration syndrome and pneumotorax. The severe respiratory distress and the ventilatory parameters led us to consider the use of surfactant.

The major cerebral lesions in these infants are of circulatory origin and pulsed and color Doppler evaluation has become an important tool for studying cerebral hemodynamics. To aim for minimal handling of the premature infants, we wanted to investigate whether measuring blood flow velocity toward or away from the transducer probe gave equal blood flow velocity (BFV) estimates within the same vessel, thus enabling us to measure both middle cerebral arteries (MCA's) from one side only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4302"><title>Methods</title><p>Using an 8.5 Hz probe BFV was measured in the right and left MCA by placing the probe over the respective temporal template.

At that time foodborne botulism was thought. In the next 12h he developed ptosis and extraocular muscle weakness. Serum and stools specimens were collected. It was administrated trivalent antitoxin. Five days after admission he as initiated weakness and diminished tendons reflexes of the upper extremities. The lumbar puncture performed was normal. The electromyography revealed an incremental increase in amplitude to rapid repetitive stimulation. Since then the clinical features suffered a favourable evolution. Nine days after admission it was confirmed the diagnosis by the identification of the B toxin. He was released home. Six months later is physical exam was normal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4363" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In the reported cases in our country the antitoxin administration was not performed but the evolution were less favourable than in our case.

This is imperative in critical care transport where trainees work in foreign, exposed environments. Consequently, critical examination of practice is essential. This study evaluates the effect of reflective practice on a group of paediatric critical care trainees during an attachment to a specialised retrieval service.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4470"><title>Methods</title><p>Trainees already maintained a mandatory logbook of their retrievals. After receiving instruction and on-going support, trainees recorded retrievals as episodes of reflection over an 8-month.

These techniques also explored factors that facilitated or hindered reflective practice.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4471" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Despite intensity of work and time constraints, trainees were able to reflect on their practice. They perceived benefits both in clinical management skills and professional development, particularly in areas not covered by conventional training. There was broad agreement on organisational factors (time, service requirements and training) as facilitators of reflection and both organisational (time and extra work) and emotional factors (fear of criticism, fear of competency assessment) as barriers.

Click ratedependent changes in BAER variables in the CLD infants were generally similar to the term controls, although slightly different.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4492" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>BAER components, mainly reflecting central auditory function, in the preterm infants with CLD increased significantly. The increase in wave V latency and I-V interval is due to the increase in III-V interval. These results suggest that there is delayed neural conduction in the more central portion of the auditory brainstem following neonatal CLD.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4493"><title>Pilot Study Using Niro-200 in Very Low Birth Weight (VLBW) Infants to Assess Cerebral Autoregulation</title><p><bold>A C Doolan</bold>, A R Twomey</p><p>National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, Ireland</p><sec id="Sec4494"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRO) uses light spectroscopy, to provide us with information about oxygenation within the tissues, measuring changes in the concentration of oxygenated haemoglobin (Hb02), deoxygenated haemoglobin (HHb), total haemoglobin (HbT), tissue oxygenation index (TOI) and tissue haemoglobin index (THI), thus giving us information about brain oxygenation, cerebral blood volume and cerebral blood flow.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4495"><title>Methods</title><p>The aim was to observe if infants &#x0003c;1.5kg demonstrated evidence of cerebral autoregulation in response to position changes.

Increased oxidative stress (OS) in brains of fetuses with DS has been proposed on the basis of evidence of impaired metabolism of oxygen free radicals and enhanced lipid peroxidation in vitro.

On the 3rd day of life a 27 G PICC was insterted, with radiological control. On the 29th day, while on CPAP, HFOV was reinstituted due to apneic episodes. Thereafter, an increasing respiratory distress and hemodynamic compromise rapidly developed. Chest Xray revealed a bilateral pleural effusion with increasing cardiomegaly ; 2DEcho showed a &#x02018;swinging heart&#x02019; with marked pericardial effusion. The diastolic volume resulted reduced, thereby impairing LV outflow. Suddenly, the infant became severely hypotensive and bradycardic. A rescue emergency pericardiocentesis [6 mL] avoided the impending cardiogenic shock. A right chest tube was inserted draining 26 mL of milky fluid. Recovered pleural and pericardial effusion fluid analysis was similar to the intravenous fluids given through PICC. Subsequently, oxygenation markedly improved and ventilator settings could be greatly reduced; inotropes were no longer required. Chest X rays confirmed the lung clearing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4797" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Cardiac tamponade represents an emergency situation leading to a fatal outcome without early diagnosis/timely intervention. Pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade have been reported in 1-3% of neonates with PICC (30&#x02013;50% mortality). The coexistence of acute pericardial and bilateral pleural effusions from parenteral fluid extravasation remains a very uncommon finding.

The mean hospital stay was 2.84 days (versus 4.83 days with OA) (significant difference). Infectious complications presented in 4.29% (versus 1.75% in the OA group) (this difference was not significant). Postoperative pain and need for analgesia were less in the TA group than in the OA (difference did not reach significance). The savings resulting from the transumbilical technique represents some 90,561.97&#x020ac; / year compared with the cost that laparoscopic appendectomy would incur, and some 42,232.37&#x020ac; / year versus traditional, open surgery.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4857" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Once the learning curve is overcome, we trust that the percentage of infectious complications will decline sharply.

The first step on &#x0201c;The Milky Way&#x0201d; is skin-to-skin contact. This is easy as in Denmark we mostly use nasal-CPAP rather than ventilator treatment when possible. As soon as the infant is stabile with nasal-CPAP it will be put to the mother's breast to smell and taste and suck for pleasure. This will help the infant to be able to suck sooner when strong enough. The transitioning process will often take time for the premature infant, from days to weeks.

This study suggests that childhood vaccines are well known and appreciated by mothers of all levels of education.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5183"><title>A Comparison of Growth in Preterm Infants Fed Two Different Types of Infant Formula Protein</title><p><bold>K N Florendo</bold><sup>1</sup>, A VanZwol<sup>2</sup>, B Bellflower<sup>1</sup>, R J Cooke<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Division of Neonatology, University of Tennessee, Memphis, TN, USA, <sup>2</sup>Division of Neonatology, VU University Medical School, Amsterdam, The Netherlands</p><sec id="Sec5184"><title>Background and Aims</title><p>Feeding dies suggest that feeding tolerance is better in preterm infants fed formulas containing hydrolyzed whey proteins. However, concern also exists about the biologic value of such formula. We speculated that tolerance, and, therefore, growth would be better in preterm infants fed hydrolyzed whey-based formula when compared to a standard preterm infant formula.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5185"><title>Methods</title><p>In a single-center, double-blind randomized controlled trial, infants weighing &#x0003c; or = 1750g at birth, &#x0003c; or = 34 weeks gestation, and tolerating 150cc/k/day enterally for &#x0003e;24 hours were randomized to receive standard premature infant formula (Group A) or a premature infant formula containing 100% hydrolyzed whey protein (Group B) for 3 weeks. Anthropometry and blood chemistries (BUN, total protein, albumin) were determined at the beginning of the study and weekly thereafter. At the end of the study, plasma amino acids, fatty acids, transferrin, and retinol binding protein were also determined. Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and a per protocol basis. According to data distribution, a difference in weight gain of 3 g/d would be significant. Primary outcome was weight gain; secondary outcomes were feeding tolerance and gains in length and head circumference.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5186" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 80 infants enrolled, 74 completed the study; 2 were never started due to age, 2 were lost to follow-up, and 2 were lost due to sepsis, 1 of whom had NEC. Two infants (1 from each group)were dropped from the per protocol data due to lack of compliance but were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. No significant difference was found between treatment groups for demographics, protocol compliance, or gains in weight (0.9g/d difference, p 0.54) length (0.434mm/wk difference, p 0.51), or head circumference (0.328mm/wk, p 0.44). There were 2 episodes of feeding intolerance, 1 in each group. Two adverse events (1 NEC, Group A; 1 GBS sepsis, Group B) were also equally distributed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5187" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Preterm infants fed hydrolyzed whey protein-based formula have equivalent growth compared to preterm infants fed standard non-hydrolyzed whey-casein based formula.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec5188"><title>Effect of Intravenous Ibuprofen on Bilirubin Binding in Preterm Infants: Interim Data</title><p>L Desfrere</p><p>France</p><p>Abstract not available at the time of printing.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><label>1)</label><citation citation-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></person-group><source>Writing for academic journals</source><year>2005</year><publisher-loc>Maidenhead</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Open University Press</publisher-name></citation><citation citation-type="display-unstructured">Murray R (2005) Writing for academic journals.

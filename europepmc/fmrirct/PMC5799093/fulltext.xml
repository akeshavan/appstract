The availability of multiplex PCR assay is actually frequently performed. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess presence of viral species using a multiplex PCR assay in adult patients admitted to ICU for respiratory failure during the November&#x02013;April period.</p><p id="Par3"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> All adult patients admitted to ICU during the November&#x02013;April period for respiratory failure were eligible. A respiratory sampling was performed according to patient severity&#x02014;sputum, tracheal aspiration, or per fibroscopic broncho alveolar lavage (LBA) and was analyzed for conventional bacterial strain. In all the patients, a multiplex vial PCR assay was performed on pharyngeal aspirate or LBA fluid.</p><p id="Par4"><bold>Results:</bold> During the study period 123 patients were analyzed (male 76, SAPS II: 49&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;17&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;age 69&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;18). 70 of them had at least one respiratory comorbidity. Forty-nine patients required invasive mechanical ventilation. Shock defined by requirement of vasoconstrictor was recorded in 31 patients (23%). In ICU mortality was 23%. Multiplex PCR assay was positive in 23 patients (17%). Co infection by bacteria and virus was noted in 4 patients. Influenzae virus was found in 10 patients and VRS in nine. Four patients with a positive viral sample had a fatal outcome (Influenza virus was found in all these). Mechanical ventilation was required in 45% of patients who were VRS positive but all had a favourable outcome.</p><p id="Par5"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Positive viral sample is not infrequent in ICU patients with respiratory failure. VRS is in this study as frequently found than influenzae.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>CO-02 Low plasma citrulline concentration is associated with sepsis among critically ill patients</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Piton Ga&#x000eb;l<sup>1</sup>, Chaignat Claire<sup>1</sup>, Renaud Lo&#x000ef;c<sup>1</sup>, Benoit Cypriani<sup>1</sup>, Hadrien Winiszewski<sup>1</sup>, Gilles Capellier<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec8"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU Besan&#x000e7;on, Besan&#x000e7;on, France</title><sec id="Sec9"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Piton Ga&#x000eb;l - gpiton@chu-besancon.fr</title><p id="Par6"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-02</p><p id="Par7"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Plasma citrulline concentration, a biomarker of enterocyte function, is frequently low among critically ill patients. Plasma citrulline concentration might be decreased among critically ill patients presenting with sepsis, reflecting an alteration of small bowel function. We aimed to study the link between plasma citrulline concentration measured at ICU admission and variables related to the sepsis in critically ill patients.</p><p id="Par8"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This was a prospective observationnal study performed in a University Hospital. Critically ill patients admitted to the ICU, aged 18&#x000a0;years or more, with ICU duration expected&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;48&#x000a0;h, without chronic renal failure or small bowel disease, were included. Plasma citrulline concentration, plasma I-FABP (biomarker of enterocyte damage), search for sepsis, results of bacterial sample, and usual clinical and biological variables were collected. We compared patients presenting with low plasma citrulline concentration (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol&#x000a0;L), suspected of presenting enterocyte dysfunction, and patients with plasma citrulline concentration&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol&#x000a0;L.</p><p id="Par9"><bold>Results:</bold> Between July and December 2016, 109 patients, aged 64&#x000a0;years, 61% males, SOFA score 8 (6&#x02013;12), were included in the study. Sepsis was found in 43 patients (40%), mainly of pulmonary (58%) and digestive (21%) origins. A plasma citrulline concentration&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol&#x000a0;L at ICU admission was associated with presence of Gram Negative or Candida infection, and higher plasma concentration of CRP and PCT (all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Plasma citrulline concentration was lower among septic patients than among patients without sepsis (12.0&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol&#x000a0;L [8.6&#x02013;17.1] vs 20.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol&#x000a0;L (11.2&#x02013;27.1) respectively, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). Plasma citrulline concentration was not different among patients presenting with a sepsis of digestive origin and extra-digestive origin (7.8 [7.2&#x02013;25.2] and 13.4 [9.8&#x02013;16.3] respectively, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.29). Plasma I-FABP was significantly higher among non-survivors (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005). Other factors associated with 28-day mortality were the age, plasma creatinine and lactate concentrations, and SOFA score.</p><p id="Par10"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study confirms the link between sepsis and low plasma citrulline concentration in critically ill patients. The gut might be both the culprit, responsible for bacterial translocation, and the victim of sepsis. Indeed, the fact that plasma citrulline was also reduced during extra-digestive sepsis suggests the existence of septic enteropathy. I-FABP confirms its prognostic value among critically ill patients. The prognostic value of plasma citrulline in the critically ill requires further evaluation.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>CO-03 Point of care use of the multiplex PCR Unyvero Curetis for the rapid diagnosis of low respiratory infections: performances and practical consequences</title><sec id="Sec11"><title>Guerpillon Brice<sup>1</sup>, Negre Jean<sup>1</sup>, Bohe Julien<sup>1</sup>, Muszynska Monika<sup>1</sup>, Thiery Guillaume<sup>1</sup>, Allaouchiche Bernard<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec12"><title><sup>1</sup>Hospices civils de Lyon, Lyon, France</title><sec id="Sec13"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Guerpillon Brice - guerpillonbrice@gmail.com</title><p id="Par11"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-03</p><p id="Par12"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Lower respiratory tract infections are very common in intensive care units and require rapid microbiological diagnosis in order to optimize the clinical progression and minimize the ecological impact.

</p><p id="Par17">A total of 86 out of 103 samples collected were fully analyzed. The results obtained for 17 samples could not be interpreted due to a handling error (1), technical failures (14) and the absence of conventional antibiograms (2). Samples collected were mostly tracheal aspirates (45). Pathogenic bacteria were detected more often using MxPCR than conventional bacteriology techniques (43 samples compared to 36). Concordance ratio between those two technics is described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. Antibiotic therapy initiated in the 48&#x000a0;h preceding sample did not increase the mismatching (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.42).

Microbiological tests are not enough to early affirm the bacterial or fungal origin of the syndrome. More than fifty biomarkers have been proposed for this purpose but none have been repeatedly validated in external populations. Our goal was to address the accuracy of the biomarkers already reported as being able to efficiently discriminate between sepsis and non-septic SIRS.</p><p id="Par21"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective observational multicenter cohort of 363 consecutive patients with criteria of SIRS who were included when the attending physician considered they required antimicrobial therapy. We collected blood at inclusion to measure 53 biomarkers, including 29 plasma compounds, 10 whole blood RNA and 14 leukocyte surface markers. Patients were classified as sepsis or non-septic SIRS a posteriori, blindly to the biomarker results. Performance of each marker was assessed by AU-ROC curve. Multivariate analysis used a lasso regression (Tibshirani 1996; Musoro 2014), including multiple imputation for missing values and bootstrap validations, adapted for high numbers of variables (biomarkers).</p><p id="Par22"><bold>Results:</bold> Eighty-four patients had exclusion criteria. Ninety-one patients had non-septic SIRS and 188 had sepsis. Median [IQ] SAPS 2 score was 55 [50&#x02013;61] in both groups (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.81). Time from ICU admission to inclusion was 1 [0&#x02013;1] day. 69.8% of infections were pulmonary, most frequent strains were <italic>E. coli</italic> (23%), <italic>S. aureus</italic> (15%) and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (13%). Causes of non septic SIRS were circulatory (37%), inflammatory (25%), hypoxemia (22%) and neurological (16%). Only 8 biomarkers had a ROC-AUC over 0.6 with a 95%IC over 0.5. In multivariate lasso analyses, only CRP and HLA-DRA circulating RNA were repeatedly associated with sepsis, and no model performed better than CRP alone (ROC-AUC 0.76 [0.68&#x02013;0.84]).</p><p id="Par23"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Strengths of this series are (1) the similar severity of SIRS and sepsis groups, (2) a multicenter design and (3) the use of a multivariate method adapted to the high number of independent variables.</p><p id="Par24"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this prospective cohort, among 53 previously published biomarkers, CRP was found to better discriminate between sepsis and non septic SIRS than the other biomarkers. However, its performance was insufficient to be useful for routine use. HLA-DR circulating RNA was the only independent marker predicting infection. Multivariate models did not improve the performance of CRP alone.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>CO-05 Procalcitonin in necrotizing soft tissue infection: an interesting prognostic marker and a potentially useful marker to guide the antimicrobial therapy duration</title><sec id="Sec19"><title>Pouly Olivier<sup>1</sup>, Parmentier-Decrucq Erika<sup>1</sup>, Duburcq Thibault<sup>1</sup>, Thieffry Camille<sup>1</sup>, Mathieu Daniel<sup>1</sup>, Poissy Julien<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec20"><title><sup>1</sup>CHRU Lille, France</title><sec id="Sec21"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Pouly Olivier - olivier.pouly@hotmail.fr</title><p id="Par25"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-05</p><p id="Par26"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Procalcitonine (PCT) is a useful biomarker to reduce antibiotic exposure in intensive care units (ICU), especially in respiratory tract infections. Nevertheless, its usefulness for necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) has not yet been reported.

Initial PCT value and kinetics, demographic and clinical data were reported. We compared the duration of the antibiotic course with: 1) the IDSA guidelines that recommend to use the decrease of fever and the need for surgical debridement and, 2) a theoretical duration if a PCT-based algorithm has been applied.</p><p id="Par28"><bold>Results:</bold> We included 196 patients. Median LRINEC score was 6 [5&#x02013;8.5] and median SOFA score was 6 [4&#x02013;10]. At D28, mortality was 19.4%, significantly linked with initial PCT value (28.6&#x000a0;ng&#x000a0;mL [3.5&#x02013;58.7] in dead patients versus 3.1&#x000a0;ng&#x000a0;mL [0.7&#x02013;11.8] in survival ones&#x000a0;(p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02013;4</sup>).

The duration of the antimicrobial therapy was 12.5&#x000a0;days [10&#x02013;17]. Stopping antimicrobial therapy if PCT levels was inferior to 0.5&#x000a0;ng&#x000a0;mL or decreased of more than 80% from the initial value would have reduced the antibiotic treatment by 6.5&#x000a0;days [5&#x02013;8] (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10<sup>&#x02013;5</sup>).

During the &#x0201c;Before&#x0201d; period, sedation and analgesia was managed by the physician, while during the &#x0201c;After&#x0201d; period, it was managed by the nurses. Survivors were followed up by a phone survey at 3&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year after ICU discharge.</p><p id="Par38"><bold>Results:</bold> 1156 intubated and mechanically ventilated patients were admitted during the study period. Among the 145 included patients, 47 died and 35 were lost or disapproved the follow-up before the 3rd month. Only 62 patients accepted follow-up at 3&#x000a0;months (42.8%), 55 at 6&#x000a0;months (37.9%) and 42 at 1&#x000a0;year (29%). The presence of a new hospitalization after ICU discharge varies from 24.2 to 29.1%, between 3&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year, and the use of psychotropic drugs from 25.5 to 29%. The prevalence of PTSD (PTSS-10 score&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;35) was 12.9% at 3&#x000a0;months, 10.9% at 6&#x000a0;months and 16.7% at 1&#x000a0;year. ICU Stay has a moderate impact on quality of life at 3&#x000a0;months, 6&#x000a0;months and 1&#x000a0;year (62&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;WHOQOL-BREF score&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;96).

There is a lack of validated tools to assess oral comprehension, adapted to those patients. Outside of the critical care setting the Montreal-Toulouse aphasia test (MT-86) is a validated tool to assess language and communication capabilities. It includes an evaluation of the lexical and syntaxic comprehension. This preliminary study aimed to adapt the oral MT-86 to overcome physical limitations of intensive-care unit patients using eye-tracking technology.</p><p id="Par42"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A simplified version of the comprehension tasks from the MT-86, assessing the receptive lexicon and syntax was used. 47 item slides (2 or 4 pictures) were digitalized and integrated into an 8&#x000a0;min automated protocol, presented on a computer screen. The patient&#x02019;s ocular fixation on pictures, when instructed to do so (human voice), was recorded by an eye-tracking device (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, patient instructed to &#x0201c;look at the button&#x0201d;).

A nested exposed-unexposed design was used. The OSAS status was checked for exposed patients using the hospitalization files. Adult patients without therapeutic limitation and staying alive in ICU at least one day were included. OSAS patients were matched (1&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;n, n&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2) with non-exposed patients on body mass index, age and presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Sources of data are as various as biology, bacteriology, monitoring, therapeutic or clinical inputs. ICU dedicated PDMS provides a quick scalable synthesis of this information. Besides computerized physician order entry (CPOE) seems to reduce medications errors in intensive care unit. It enhances traceability of continuous infusion, planed drugs or any items part of the care plan. But in some emergency cases, orally given orders may not be captured in the Medical file. We studied crush induction traceability in Centricity Critical Care (CCC), ICU dedicated solution, from GE Healthcare.</p><p id="Par52"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective anonymous database analyze of 2016 in 21 French ICU using CCC. We checked: the number of endotracheal intubations done in ICU (intubation 20&#x000a0;min or later after admission), the number of induction doses of rapid onset neuromuscular blockade agents (rocuronium or suxamethonium) at the same time (sampling only non-continuous perfusion). For each ICU, we asked if nurses were allowed to capture medications on behalf of physicians in the CPOE.</p><p id="Par53"><bold>Results:</bold> During 2016, 19,736 patients were admitted, mean age was 60.68 mean SAPS II was 40.64 and length of stay was 6.69&#x000a0;days.

The traceability greatly varies between different ICU: individual ratio range from 1.32 to 83%. Third quartile was 51.55%. Traceability was better in ICU&#x02019;s where nurses can capture medications in CPOE 48.7 versus 22.49% p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.02 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Traceability of prescriptions according to the nurse transcription right</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par54"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study may suffer from 2 opposites bias: replacement of tracheal tube without anesthesia or use of bolus of rocuronium for another reason than intubation. Nevertheless, induction drugs seem to be greatly under written in the PDMS. Where nurses support, traceability is better. CCC allowed such database analyzes. Physician in charge of ICU should periodically, among others, check this indicator. Collaborative work with PDMS providers should keep enhancing traceability and safety. In our case, GE agreed in future software releases to add on top of &#x0201c;prescription&#x0201d; a &#x0201c;nurse note option&#x0201d; and when a nurse is adding a device such as endotracheal tube, tracheostomy or gastrostomy to insert a question: did you perform an anesthesia?

Inclusion criteria were (1) admission to the ICU for ARF, and (2) known or de novo granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, microscopic polyangiitis, or anti-glomerular basement membrane antibody disease. Demographics, characteristics of ICU admission, treatments and outcomes were extracted from medical records.</p><p id="Par58"><bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, 130 patients (64 [51&#x02013;75.5] years old&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;63% male) were eligible.

A mixed cause of ARF was diagnosed in 22 patients (16.9%), which was secondary classified as a primary immune cause in 16 patients, and a primary non immune cause in 6 patients. Altogether, 67 patients (51.5%) had an immune ARF (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;67), and 63 (48.5%) a non-immune ARF.

A recent survey suggests that up to 37% of patients report a certain level of anxiety related to NIV sessions. However, few is known on the actual prevalence, severity, risk factor and prognosis impact of anxiety in patients receiving NIV for an ARF. Objectives&#x02014;to determine the prevalence and intensity of anxiety in patients receiving NIV for ARF, to identify the factors associated with anxiety, to assess the impact of anxiety on the risk of NIV failure, outcome, quality of life and post&#x02014;ICU burden.</p><p id="Par62"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Second analysis of a prospective observational cohort study in patients receiving NIV for ARF in 54 ICUs in France and Belgium, in 2010&#x02013;2011.

Therefore, the effect of a SRP on the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia is uncertain. Our objective was to determine the efficacy of a simple electronic monitoring device to maintain a SRP during MV.</p><p id="Par72"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a prospective, randomized, crossover study in two ICUs. BE of the patients were continuously assessed during a sequence of two consecutive 24&#x000a0;h-periods. Each period was either a control day&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;CD or a prototype day&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;PD. During the two periods, the targeted BE was between 40&#x000b0; and 45&#x000b0;. During the CD, BE was managed according to an internal procedure published previously. During the PD, an electronic device developed by our institution was added to the bed. The device was able to monitor continuously the BE and to alarm if the patient is not in the proper position. Adults patient were eligible if they were intubated with an expected duration of MV&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;48&#x000a0;h and not eligible if they had a contraindication to SRP or a SAPS II score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;65. The time spent in a SRP defined by a BE between 40&#x000b0; and 50&#x000b0; was compared first in each crossover period by a Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test and then by a linear mixed effect model.</p><p id="Par73"><bold>Results:</bold> One-hundred-five patients were randomized and a complete set of data were available for 103 patients: 72 men&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;age 59&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;16&#x000a0;years, SAPS II score 48&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;acute respiratory failure in 28% and coma in 27%.

During the two periods, patients had a median proportion of time spent in SRP about 30% higher in PD than in CD (IQR [25&#x02013;75%]). In period 1 and period 2, patients had a higher median proportion of time spent in SRP in a PD than in a CD (93% [86&#x02013;96%] vs 59% [34&#x02013;79%], p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) and (95% [78&#x02013;97%] vs 62% [31&#x02013;92%], p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.005) respectively.

Its occurrence is favored by dynamic hyperinflation that may arise when increasing the pressure support level (PSL). Decreasing the PSL however fails to suppress ineffective triggering in a subgroup of patients that are therefore exposed to refractory ineffective triggering. Proportional assist ventilation with load-adjustable gain factors (PAV&#x000a0;+) decreases the incidence of ineffective triggering in unselected patients but its effect on refractory asynchrony during PSV is unknown.
The main aim of our study was to assess the effect of PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;in patients exhibiting refractory ineffective triggering during PSV.</p><p id="Par77"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Refractory ineffective triggering was defined as persisting ineffective triggering at the lowest tolerated PSL. Patients with refractory ineffective triggering during PSV were included. Flow, airway and esophageal pressures were continuously recorded during 10&#x000a0;min under PSV with the minimal tolerated PSL, and then under PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;with the gain adjusted to target a muscle pressure between 5 and 10&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O. Primary endpoint was the comparison of asynchrony index between PSV and PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;. Continuous data are reported as median [25<sup>th</sup>&#x02013;75th percentiles].</p><p id="Par78"><bold>Results:</bold> Seven patients with refractory ineffective triggering were included so far. The median lowest tolerated PSL was 16&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O [12&#x02013;18], with a PEEP level of 8&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O [5.5&#x02013;8] and a PaO<sub>2</sub> FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio of 209&#x000a0;mmHg [178&#x02013;225]. The median gain during PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;was 70% [63&#x02013;73]. The asynchrony index was significantly lower with PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;than PSV (3% [2&#x02013;8] vs. 24% [13&#x02013;48] respectively, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). Moreover, the asynchrony index decreased in every patient with PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Noticeably, the tidal volume was already protective in PSV and decreased even more during PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(5.71&#x000a0;mL&#x000a0;kg [4.6&#x02013;9.3] vs. 5.71&#x000a0;mL [1.8&#x02013;7.1] respectively, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03);&#x000a0;and the neural respiratory rate was high in both modes (41 cycles min [26&#x02013;51] in PSV vs. 40[28&#x02013;44] in PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.61). Total esophageal Pressure&#x02013;Time Product (PTPes) did not significantly differ between the two modes but the PTPes proportion that was wasted in ineffective efforts decreased with PAV&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(1% [1&#x02013;2] vs. 18% [7&#x02013;37], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Asynchrony index during PSV and PAV+</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig3_HTML" id="MO3"/></fig>

All victims of cardiac arrest during ICU stay are included, whereas patients presenting with cardiac arrest at the time of admission are not. By convention, any resuscitation attempt (chest compression, adrenaline and or electric shock) defines the &#x0201c;unexpected cardiac arrest&#x0201d;. The data collected comprise medical history, circumstances of happening, ongoing treatments, resuscitation maneuvers, and outcome). A 6-month follow up period is planned for survivors.</p><p id="Par88"><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-four centers (17 University and 27 general hospitals) are participating in the study, including 8 medical, 7 surgical and 29 medical surgical ICUs. Among those, nearly one-third have implemented a specific protocol regarding the management of cardiac arrest. Around half undergo regular resuscitation trainings, and among them 80% do so at least annually. Following unexpected cardiac arrest, most of ICU staffs set up post hoc debriefings (always 32%, often 20%, sometimes 41% or never 7%). On two-thirds of the investigation period, 2842 patients were victim of cardiac arrest in the participating units. Of those, 2426 did not endure any resuscitation attempt: 1687 were previously attributed a &#x0201c;do-not-resuscitate&#x0201d; order, 589 were unresponsive to maximal therapy and 150 for other reasons. Four hundred and sixteen patients (69% men, 68&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13&#x000a0;years, mean SAPS2 72&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;25) were included in the &#x0201c;unexpected cardiac arrest&#x0201d; chart.

AMI was defined as an acute intestinal injury related to a splanchno-mesenteric insufficiency and without alternative diagnosis. All AMI patients underwent a computed tomography angiography. AMI were classified in occlusive (atheroma, thrombosis, embolisms etc.) and non-occlusive (splanchnomesenteric hypoperfusion, vasoconstrictive medications), arterial and venous. Patients with post-AMI short bowel syndrome (SBS), chronic mesenteric ischemia, aorta dissection anevrism and left ischemic colitis were not included. Outcomes studied were mortality at 3&#x000a0;months and at the end of follow-up, intestinal resection, SBS and parenteral nutrition requirement. Predictive factors of intestinal resection and mortality were studied in uni- and multivariate analyses. Quantitative data were reported as medians (range).

Main etiologies of occlusive AMI were atheroma (39.5%), thrombosis (35%), embolism (9.7%). Occlusion concerned one, two or three of the digestive arteries in 54, 23 or 13%, respectively and superior mesenteric artery in 89.1% of arterial AMI. Chronic mesenteric ischemia preceded AMI in 22%. A surgical (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23) and or radiological (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;36) revascularization was performed in 56.4% of arterial AMI. Intestinal resection was necessary in 31.4%. At end of follow-up of 290 (0&#x02013;614) days, 22 (18%) patients had a SBS and 16 (13%) required parenteral nutrition. Mortality at 3&#x000a0;months and at the end of follow-up were 11.3 and 16.9%, respectively (Figure). In multivariate analysis a stay in ICU was the only factor associated with resection (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001, OR 7.9 (2.9&#x02013;21.4)) and mortality (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02, OR 4.4 (1.2&#x02013;15.4)).<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figb_HTML" id="MO5"/>

Adverse events associated with PP have been well described such as pressure sores. But although patients with moderate to severe ARDS had high mortality, had prolonged length of stay and were particularly exposed to central venous catheters (CVC), there were no data reporting intravascular catheter-related infections (ICRI). In this study, we evaluated the incidence of CVC colonization in patients exposed to PP for ARDS.</p><p id="Par112"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> In this retrospective bicentric observational study we compared two groups of adults, assigned 1:1. The &#x0201c;exposed&#x0201d; group was composed of patients treated with PP for moderate to severe ARDS. The &#x0201c;non-exposed&#x0201d; group was composed of non-ARDS patients matched with: centre, year, sex, age, APACHE II score and length of ICU stay. ICRI incidence rate (1/1000 catheter-days) and preventive bundles were similar between the two centres, as well as the practice for PP session. The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter-related colonization in each group.

The P55 pneumonia cartridge of the multiplex-PCR Unyvero (Curetis) system allows identification of 19 bacteria and 1 fungi among the most frequently responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and 19 of their resistance markers directly in clinical specimens. We aimed to evaluate the concordance between this technique and the conventional microbiological methods (CMM) for the diagnosis of VAP, assuming that it could support a decrease in broad-spectrum antibiotics consumption.</p><p id="Par127"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective, observational, single centre study. All consecutive patients with suspected VAP and a positive direct examination of broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (i.e. intracellular bacteria on direct examination) were included.

The Unyvero system correctly identified pathogens in 35 (80%) patients&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;whereas no bacteria were detected for 4 patients, and a bacteria different that the one identified by CMM for 5 patients (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab4" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

These failures were mainly observed for Pa (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14, 74% of failures). In non-Pa VAP, the system failed to detect penicillinase in 2 patients with Enterobacteriaceae, and ESBL in 2 patients with E. coli VAP.

Prognosis and outcomes mainly depend on the precocity of diagnosis and specific treatment implementation. A few studies were interested in HLH occuring in ICU patients. The Purpose of the study was to describe epidemiological, clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic characteristics of HLH in ICU patients.</p><p id="Par132"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> It was a retrospective, descriptive and longitudinal study including 30 cases of HLH, assessed during a 5&#x000a0;years period in the intensive care unit. We included all patients who had evidence of hemophagocytosis in bone marrow smears (realized when HLH was suspected) and a H-score superior to 169.</p><p id="Par133"><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of our patients was 48.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;17.6&#x000a0;years [17&#x02013;80] with a female preavalence. Hypertension and diabetes were the most frequent comorbidities. Immunodepression was present in 5 patients. Shock and neurological disorders were the main causes of admission in ICU. Mean APACHE II and SOFA (admission) scores were respectively 22.6 and 8.2. Fever was the most common clinical presentation in SAM. The most common biological disorder was bicytopenia (anemia and thrombopenia). The mean H-score was 209.7 p. Hemodynamic and respiratory distress were the prevalent organ failures. Cortico&#x000ef;ds and immunoglobuline were given respectively to 14 and 13 patients. Etoposid was taken by one patient. Infections were the largely predominant etiology of HLH with a clear prevalence of multidrug resistant bacterial infections. Mortality at day 28 was 40%. Septic shock was the leading cause of death. SOFA and APACHE II scores were the only predictive factors of mortality (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.015 and p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.042).</p><p id="Par134"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Management a patient with HLH is challenging because of its rarity, its variable presentation and its association with a panel of disorders. A multidisciplinary approach is mandatory to determine the best therapeutic option for the patient.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec106"><title>CO-27 Effects of red blood cell transfusion on global oxygenation in anemic critically ill patients</title><sec id="Sec107"><title>Themelin Nicolas<sup>1</sup> Biston Patrick<sup>1</sup>, Massart Jacqueline<sup>1</sup>, Piagnerelli Michael<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec108"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU de Charleroi, Belgium</title><sec id="Sec109"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Themelin Nicolas - nicolas.themelin@ulb.ac.be</title><p id="Par135"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-27</p><p id="Par136"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Anemia and RBC transfusion as treatment are common in ICU patients. Neverthless, RBC transfusions are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Restrictive strategy policy, based on a haemoglobin [Hb] level of 7&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;dL, is the guideline to transfuse most of ICU patients. The aim of RBC transfusion is to avoid tissue hypoxia by improving oxygen delivery (DO2) and therefore oxygen consumption (VO2). This could suggest to combine [Hb] and some parameters reflecting the sytemic DO2 VO2 balance to decide to transfuse. This study aims to analyse the effects of RBC transfusion on the systemic oxygenation assessed by the (central) venous oxygen saturation (S(c)VO2), the lactate level, the venous-to-arterial carbon dioxyde pressure gradient (Pv-aCO2) and the ratio between cardiac index and O<sub>2</sub> extraction (IC EO2), and to assess their usefulness in the transfusion decision.</p><p id="Par137"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> During 9&#x000a0;months, all adult patients transfused in the ICU of CHU-Charleroi Marie Curie were included except patients with active bleeding or without jugular or subclavicular catheter. The systemic oxygenation parameters have been measured before and after transfusion. Patients a priori have been grouped according to their initial S(c)VO2 (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;or&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;70%), to their cardiac (&#x0003c;&#x000a0;or&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;50% of a left ventricular ejection fraction) and septic status. The results are expressed in median and interquartile ranges. Comparisons were made by a Wilcoxon test.</p><p id="Par138"><bold>Results:</bold> 86 RBC transfusions were made on 53 patients. For all patients, mean arterial pressure, [Hb] and S(c)VO2 increased significantly after transfusion ([Hb]: 7.4 [7&#x02013;7.8] to 8.3 [7.7&#x02013;8.8]&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;dL;&#x000a0;MAP: 79 [69&#x02013;90] to 82 [74&#x02013;92]&#x000a0;mmHg and S(c)VO2: 66 [60&#x02013;73] to 69 [63&#x02013;75]&#x000a0;%;&#x000a0;for all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Only patients with an initial S(c)VO2&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;70% improved it after transfusion (62 [58&#x02013;65] to 66 [62&#x02013;71]&#x000a0;%;&#x000a0;p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). The Pv-aCO2 was significantly higher in patients with an initial S(c)VO2&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;70% (8 [5&#x02013;10] mmHg) but did not change after transfusion as [lactate] and IC EO2.

It should be interesting to combine it with the [Hb] in the decision to transfuse anemic critically ill patient.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec110"><title>CO-28 Elderly patients with cancer in the ICU</title><sec id="Sec111"><title>Sirjacques Camille<sup>1</sup>, Ameye Lieveke<sup>1</sup>, Berghmans Thierry<sup>1</sup>, Paesmans Marianne<sup>1</sup>, Sculier Jean-Paul<sup>1</sup>, Meert Anne-Pascale<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec112"><title><sup>1</sup>Institut Jules Bordet, Bruxelles, Belgium</title><sec id="Sec113"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Sirjacques Camille - Camille.Sirjacques@ulb.ac.be</title><p id="Par140"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-28</p><p id="Par141"><bold>Introduction:</bold> There is very little data on the survival of elderly patients with cancer requiring admission to intensive care unit (ICU).

In case of multiple admissions only the 1st admission was used for the statistical analyses.</p><p id="Par143"><bold>Results:</bold> We recorded 311 admissions for 270 patients over the 3&#x000a0;years period. The main reasons for admission were cardiovascular (22%), respiratory (17%) and hemodynamic (13%). ICU and in-hospital mortality rates were respectively 10% (95% CI 6&#x02013;13%) and 22% (95% CI 17&#x02013;27%). Median survival after discharge from hospital was 7.8&#x000a0;months (95% CI 5.7&#x02013;11.3). The identified prognostic factors for higher hospital mortality were non invasive ventilation use (OR 9.8, 95% CI 3.3&#x02013;28.5), invasive mechanical ventilation use (OR 8.6, 95% CI 3.4&#x02013;21.9) and the existence of a therapeutic limitation in the first 24&#x000a0;h (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.5&#x02013;6.6) (assessment of all covariates was restricted to the period of 24&#x000a0;h following ICU admission). After hospital discharge, prognostic factors for higher risk of death were Charlson&#x02019;s score bigger than 8 (HR 2.73, 95% CI 1.93&#x02013;3.86), SAPS II score bigger than 37 (HR 1.50, 95% CI 1.08&#x02013;2.09), administration of amines in the first 24&#x000a0;h (HR 2.13, 95% CI 1.03&#x02013;4.38) and the existence of a life-sustaining therapeutic limitation in the first 24&#x000a0;h (HR 2.35, 95% CI 48&#x02013;3.73). A total of 77% of patients were able to benefit from an antineoplastic treatment after hospital discharge.</p><p id="Par144"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> 78% of oncologic patients aged more than 65&#x000a0;years were discharged alive from hospitalization after an ICU stay and the large majority were still able to benefit from cancer treatment. Life-sustaining therapeutic limitation is directly related to hospital mortality and post-discharge survival.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec114"><title>CO-29 Clinical features and outcomes of central nervous system (CNS) infections in critically ill immunocompromised patients</title><sec id="Sec115"><title>Kerhuel Lionel<sup>1</sup>, Mariotte Eric<sup>1</sup>, Zafrani Lara<sup>1</sup>, Ghrenassia Etienne<sup>1</sup>, Ardisson Fanny<sup>1</sup>, Ekpe Kenneth<sup>1</sup>, Darmon Mickael<sup>1</sup>, Azoulay Elie<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec116"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Avicenne, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec117"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Kerhuel Lionel - lionel.kerhuel@aphp.fr</title><p id="Par145"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-29</p><p id="Par146"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Studies assessing outcomes of CNS infections in critically ill immunocompromised patients are scarce.

Half the TTP were idiopathic, 25 autoimmune, 5 drug-related and 4 surrounded pregnancies. At initial clinical evaluation organ involvement was present in all patients, including neurological (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;77), cardiac (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;76), renal (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;50), or digestive (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;32). All patients received urgent plasma therapy with a median number of plasma exchanges of 11(8&#x02013;18) and all but 3 received steroids, including 28 who received bolus. 52 patients required a rescue therapy (49 rituximab, 21 vincristine, 4 cyclophopshamide, and 6 splenectomy). 68 patients required antihypertensive therapy, 24 mechanical ventilation, 18 vasopressors and 15 renal-replacement therapy. Cardiac involvement was observed in 89 (91%) patients. Namely, 23 patients exerted chest pain, 57 electrocardiogram changes, 70 (71%) increased troponin, and 6 cardiac arrest. Troponin was the only feature of cardiac involvement in 24 patients. In 13 patients, echocardiography identified focal or global hypokinesia. Anticoagulants were prescribed in 86 patients (58 prophylactic and 28 curative) and 88 patients received low dose aspirin. Hospital mortality was 9.4%. All the 9 patients without cardiac involvement survived. Cardiac involvement was associated with prolonged ICU stay (6 (4&#x02013;7) vs. 8 (6&#x02013;14), p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04). By univariable analysis, factors associated with mortality included age, platelet count, status epilepticus, troponin level, cardiac arrest.

Early adequate antibiotic administration, usually including beta-lactams, improves prognosis of septic patients. However, beta-lactam pharmacokinetic as well as effect of renal replacement therapy (RRT) on beta-lactam concentrations have been hardly explored in ICU patients with acute kidney injury (AKI). We aimed to determine factors associated with potential suboptimal beta-lactam concentration in critically-ill patients with AKI treated either with an early or a delayed RRT strategy.</p><p id="Par167"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Ancillary study in a subset of patients with severe AKI (KDIGO3), receiving a beta-lactam antibiotic, in a trial comparing two RRT initiation strategies. In this trial, patients from 31 intensive care units were randomly assigned to either an early (immediate RRT) or a delayed (late or no RRT) RRT initiation strategy. Beta-lactam residual concentrations were sampled at 24 and 48&#x000a0;h after inclusion. The appropriate concentration was defined as a trough of at least 4 times the minimal inhibitory concentration (clinical breakpoint of EUCAST). The primary outcome was an adequate plasma concentration of the beta-lactam during the first 2&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="Par168"><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 233 patients included in the 11 centers participating to this ancillary study, a beta-lactam trough concentration was evaluated in 112 subjects, 53 in the early and 59 in the delayed groups. Ninety patients (80.4%) had an adequate beta-lactam dosage. RRT initiation strategy had no impact on beta-lactam concentration (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.78). Among the 83 septic shock patients (74% of the sampled patients), 73 (88%) had a correct antibiotic concentration. In contrast, only 10 of the 16 patients without definite sepsis (62.5%) had a correct dosage. Factors associated with an adequate beta-lactam trough concentration in univariate analysis were admission for a septic shock (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002), a higher plasma creatinine level (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.024), a higher mean arterial pressure (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.018) and a lower serum bicarbonate level (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.045) at randomization. A higher SOFA score was associated with an adequate beta-lactam concentration near to statistical significance (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.053). Multivariate analysis will be presented.</p><p id="Par169"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In the context of severe AKI, beta-lactam concentration reached a sufficient level in 88% of septic shock patients. Interestingly, RRT initiation strategy was not associated with beta-lactam trough concentration. Early RRT did not affect trough concentration of beta-lactam. We may hypothesize that physicians were highly vigilant and adapted antibiotic administration adequately in these patients.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec134"><title>CO-45 Predictors of insufficient Amikacin peak concentration in critically ill patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</title><sec id="Sec135"><title>Touchard Cyril<sup>1</sup>, Aubry Alexandra<sup>2</sup>, Br&#x000e9;chot Nicolas<sup>1</sup>, Lebreton Guillaume<sup>2</sup>, Besset Sebastien<sup>2</sup>, Franchineau Guillaume<sup>2</sup>, Hekimian Guillaume<sup>2</sup>, Nieszkowska Ania<sup>2</sup>, Leprince Pascal<sup>2</sup>, Luyt Charles-Edouard<sup>2</sup>, Combes Alain<sup>2</sup>, Schmidt<sup>2</sup>, Matthieu<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec136"><title><sup>1</sup>Clinique du Parc, Aix-en-Provence, France; <sup>2</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Piti&#x000e9;-Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re, Paris, France; <sup>3</sup>Clinique Saint George, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec137"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Touchard Cyril - cyriltouchard@hotmail.fr</title><p id="Par170"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-45</p><p id="Par171"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Amikacin infusion requires to target a peak serum concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) 8&#x02013;10 times the minimal inhibitory concentration, corresponding to a C<sub>max</sub> at 60&#x02013;80&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;L<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for the least susceptible bacteria.

Broad-spectrum beta-lactams (BL) are daily used and may have neurological side effects, notably in cases of overdosing. We aimed to assess impact of BL overdosing on confusion through a validated method, the CAM ICU (Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU) as a primary endpoint, and to look for pharmacokinetic factors associated with respect of the BL therapeutic index as a secondary objective.</p><p id="Par178"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective observational study&#x02013;pilot study in two centers. Patients treated with broad spectrum BL for more than 48&#x000a0;h to treat sepsis or septic shock in the ICU could be included. Delirium was assessed through CAM-ICU, and determined group of inclusion: delirium patients or control group. Exclusion citeria were RASS inferior or equal to:&#x000a0;3, imipenem, and other obvious causes of neurologic failure (stroke, poisoning, previous neurological disorders). BL concentrations were measured at peak and trough for intermittent and extended perfusion, and at plateau for continuous perfusion, by high performance chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Data were expressed as median [25&#x02013;75%, interquartile range]. Statistical were performed by Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test and Pearson test. Analysis referred to delirium factors and betalactams&#x02019; concentrations, and PK factors (obesity, renal failure, hypoalbuminemia) and overdosing.</p><p id="Par179"><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty patients were included (29 with delirium, 21 controls), at day 4 for controls and day 5 for patients with confusion. Delirium patients were more severely ill SOFA 5 [3;&#x000a0;9] versus 3[1;&#x000a0;5] (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05);&#x000a0;with higher RASS 1[0;&#x000a0;2] versus 0[0;&#x000a0;0] (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05). They presented with 41% BL overdosing versus 19% in controls (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.09);&#x000a0;with 41% of BL in therapeutic index: 71% in controls (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04). Obesity and renal failure were not associated with BL overdosing but there was a trend with hypoalbuminemia (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.09).</p><p id="Par180"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Trend in association of BL overdosing with delirium corresponds to previous studies, and would need a larger scale study to be confirmed. Severity differences in groups would need changes in inclusion criteria to obtain homogeneous groups. A possible association of BL underdosing with poor evolution of infection and organ failures would need more precise evaluation. Hypoalbuminemia could have an impact on BL overdosing.</p><p id="Par181"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Delirium was not associated with BL overdosing but with therapeutic index. A high variability of BL concentrations warrants therapeutic drug monitoring.

DPRS, DPL and chest wall driving-pressure (DPCW) were measured before and 1&#x000a0;h after prone positioning. Respiratory system, pulmonary and chest wall elastance (ERS, EL, ECW) were calculated at the same time. Finally, we studied the correlation between these respiratory variables and oxygenation indicators.

At each study day, investigators had to screen every patient staying in ICU from 0 to 24&#x000a0;h and to fill electronic CRF. For patients with ARDS (defined from the Berlin definition criteria) at each study day oxygenation and ventilator settings were recorded. For those receiving PP these variables were recorded before and at the end of PP session. The reasons for not proning were also collected. Values are presented as median (1st&#x02013;3rd quartiles).

Here, we describe the main etiologies, management and outcomes of the patients of this cohort presenting with severe hypoxemia.</p><p id="Par204"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A PPD was conducted among 117 French speaking ICUs during spring 2016. Hypoxemia was defined by a PaO2 FiO2 ratio below 300. We analyzed the data from patients with severe hypoxemia (i.e. with a PaO2 FiO2 ratio&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;100) and compared their characteristics (causes of hypoxemia, ventilatory and non-ventilatory management) and outcomes to the patients with mild or moderate hypoxemia.</p><p id="Par205"><bold>Results:</bold> Among the 859 hypoxemic patients the day of the study, 74 (9%) had severe hypoxemia. The main cause of hypoxemia was pneumonia and this diagnosis was more frequent than in mild and moderate hypoxemia. Whereas bilateral radiologic infiltrates were present in 56 (84.9%) patients, ARDS was diagnosed by physicians in only 30 (40.5%) of them. Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) was used in 55 (74.3%) patients. High flow oxygen was administered in 11 (14.9%) of them and 8 (10.8%) were under non-invasive ventilation (NIV) the day of the study. Median Vt was 6.1 (4.8&#x02013;6.6) ml&#x000a0;kg of IBW. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) was higher than in mild and moderate hypoxemic patients (10 (8&#x02013;12) vs. 5 (5&#x02013;8) and 7 (5&#x02013;10)&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O respectively, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). Median plateau pressure was 25.5 (23&#x02013;29.5) and was higher than in mild and moderate groups. Median driving pressure was 13 (10&#x02013;19)&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O with no difference when compared to other groups. Neuromuscular blocking agents were administered in 28 (51.9%) patients, inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in 7 (13%) patients and only 6 patients (11.1%) were on prone positioning. Fourteen (18.9%) patients were under extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). ICU mortality was higher in severe hypoxemic patients as compared to mild and moderate (50.7 vs. 21.3 and 28.5% respectively, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

We herein investigated the risk factors and the outcomes of ICU-acquired infections in a recent cohort of septic shock patients.</p><p id="Par209"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This was a 9-year (2008&#x02013;2016) monocenter retrospective study. All adult patients diagnosed for septic shock within the first 48&#x000a0;h were included. Septic shock was defined as a microbiologically proven or clinically suspected infection, associated with acute circulatory failure requiring vasopressors. Patients who survived the first three days were eligible for assessment of the risk of the first ICU-acquired infections. The diagnosis of nosocomial infections were based on current international guidelines. Patients were classified according to the development of pulmonary or non-pulmonary ICU-acquired infections. The determinants of ICU-acquired infections were addressed in a multivariate logistic regression analysis.</p><p id="Par210"><bold>Results:</bold> 938 patients were admitted for septic shock. 788 patients remained alive in the ICU after the first three days and could then be evaluated for the risk of ICU-acquired infections. Hence, 554 patients remained free of secondary infections, 138 patients first developed an episode of nosocomial pneumonia and 96 patients first developed an episode of non-pulmonary infection. The mortality rates of patients with ICU-acquired pneumonia, non-pulmonary ICU-acquired infections and without secondary infections were 49, 49 and 14%, respectively (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0001). In multivariate analysis, the development of ICU-acquired pneumonia was independently associated with male gender (OR 2.23, CI 95% [1.28&#x02013;3.48], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003), renal replacement therapy (OR 2.15, CI 95% [1.35&#x02013;3.42], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001), platelet transfusion (OR 2.38, CI 95% [1.4&#x02013;4.04], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001) and a primary pulmonary infection (OR 8.06, CI 95% [2.69&#x02013;24.12], p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

Several experimental studies suggested that albumin could have additional protective effects on the vascular wall and more specifically on endothelial functions. However, the in vivo effect of albumin in human endothelium remains unknown. The aim of this study is to assess the effect of albumin or saline infusion on skin endothelial function in septic shock patients requiring volume expansion.</p><p id="Par214"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We performed a prospective randomized monocentric study in an 18-bed medical intensive care unit. All patients with septic shock who required fluid administration were included between H6 and H24 after vasopressor starting. Patients were randomized to receive either 500&#x000a0;ml of saline solution 0.9% or 100&#x000a0;ml of albumin 20%. Norepinephrine dose was not modified 1&#x000a0;h before and during the procedure. Endothelium-dependant vasodilatation in the skin circulation was assessed by iontophoresis of acetylcholine before and after fluid administration. The improvement of skin blood flow in response to acetylcholine after fluid administration was compared between groups. For each patient, age, sex, SAPS II, site of infection, global hemodynamic parameters and clinical microcirculatory parameters were recorded. Results are expressed as mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SD.

Twelve patients received saline and 10 received albumin. Apart from age, no statistical difference was found between groups regarding demographic characteristics and baseline hemodynamic parameters. Norepinephrine dose and mean volume of infused fluid before inclusion was not different between groups (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab6" ref-type="table">1</xref>). Before fluid replacement, endothelial response to acetylcholine iontophoresis was not different between groups (AUC 3514 vs 3378;&#x000a0;p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.16). Volume expansion induced a slight increase of systolic arterial pressure, significantly higher in the albumin group (7 vs 2%;&#x000a0;p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02) with no difference regarding cardiac output variations between groups. Next, we compared the variations of endothelium response to iontophoresis before and after fluid infusion.

We also evaluated 10 healthy controls. Intervention&#x02014;resistance to corticosteroids was assessed using a skin test. 10&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of dermocorticoid cream (class III, Betamethasone) was applied on a 3&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup> surface of the skin. At 24&#x000a0;h, two independent physicians scored the blanching of the skin from 0 to 4&#x02014;0- no blanching&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1-&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;50% of surface&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2- 50 to 75% of surface&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;3- 75 to 100% of surface, and 4- blanching beyond application area. Cohen&#x02019;s kappa was used to measure concordance. A mean score of&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2 indicated corticoresistance and a score of 4 indicating normal sensitivity to corticosteroids. We also performed a 250&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g ACTH test.</p><p id="Par230"><bold>Results:</bold> We enrolled 110 patients, 47 patients with septic shock (22 males, SAPSII 34 [6&#x02013;114]) and 63 patients without sepsis (28 males, SAPSII 30 [6&#x02013;100]). Overall, 81 95 (85%) with two measurements patients had concordant evaluation of score by the two physicians&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;while 14 had a difference of 1-point in scores, resulting in a kappa of 0.78 (95% CI 0.65&#x02013;0.91). In patients with septic shock, 32 (78%) have corticoresistance, i.e. a mean score&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;2, 8 (20%) a score of 2 or 3, and 1 (2%) has normal sensitivity to corticosteroids. In non-septic critically ill, 30 (56%) have corticoresistance, 20 (37%) a mean score of 2&#x02013;3, and 4 (7%) have normal sensitivity to corticosteroids. Hence, as compared to non-septic patients, patients with septic shock were more likely to have corticoresistance (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04).</p><p id="Par231"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Topic application of corticosteroids on the skin results in activation of glucocorticoid receptors present within the vessels. Subsequently, activation of lipocortin 1 may inhibit the activity of phospholipase A2, regulator of prostaglandins, leucotrienes and platelet activating factor. Then, the coupling of alpha adrenoreceptors to their agonists is potentiated, increasing vessels smooth muscles sensitivity to catecholamines. The subsequent local vasocontriction is reflected by skin blanching. Thus, the observed lack of skin blanching in septic patients may reflect altered coupling between gluocorticoids and glucocorticoids receptors.</p><p id="Par232"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Roughly one out of two adults with septic shock may develop a resistance to corticosteroids as assessed by a skin blanching test in response to betamethasone.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec182"><title>CO-62 Short term antibiotics prevents early VAP in patients treated with mild therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest</title><sec id="Sec183"><title>Daix Thomas<sup>1</sup>, Cariou Alain<sup>2</sup>, Clere-Jehl Rapha&#x000eb;l<sup>3</sup>, Dequin Pierre-Fran&#x000e7;ois<sup>4</sup>, Guitton Christophe<sup>5</sup>, Deye Nicolas<sup>6</sup>, Plantef&#x000e8;ve Ga&#x000eb;tan<sup>7</sup>, Quenot Jean-Pierre<sup>8</sup>, Desachy Arnaud<sup>9</sup>, Kamel Toufik<sup>10</sup>, Bedon-Carte Sandrine<sup>11</sup>, Diehl Jean-Luc<sup>12</sup>, Nicolas Chudeau<sup>13</sup>, Karam Elias<sup>14</sup>, Renon-Caron Fran&#x000e7;oise<sup>1</sup>, Vignon Philippe<sup>1</sup>, Le Gouge Am&#x000e9;lie<sup>4</sup>, Fran&#x000e7;ois Bruno<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec184"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU Dupuytren, Limoges, France; <sup>2</sup>HU Paris-Centre, Paris, France; <sup>3</sup>H&#x000f4;pital civil, Strasbourg, France; <sup>4</sup>CHU Bretonneau, Tours, France; <sup>5</sup>CHU de Nantes, Nantes, France; <sup>6</sup>CHU Lariboisi&#x000e8;re, Paris, France; <sup>7</sup>CH Victor Dupouy, Argenteuil, France; <sup>8</sup>CHU de Dijon, France; <sup>9</sup>CH d&#x02019;Angoul&#x000ea;me, France; <sup>10</sup>CHR Orl&#x000e9;ans, Orl&#x000e9;ans, France; <sup>11</sup>CH de P&#x000e9;rigueux, France; <sup>12</sup>HU Paris-Ouest, Paris, France; <sup>13</sup>CHU Le Mans, France; <sup>14</sup>CHU de Brive La Gaillarde, France</title><sec id="Sec185"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Daix Thomas - thomas.daix@wanadoo.fr</title><p id="Par233"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>CO-62</p><p id="Par234"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Mild therapeutic hypothermia, currently recommended in the management of cardiac arrests with shockable rhythm could promote infectious complications and especially ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (Mongardon et al.

Invasive ventilation shared a grim prognosis in the past and non-invasive ventilation had been recommended in these patients, however NIV efficacy has been recently challenged and the advent of high flow oxygen therapy had brought even more complexity in the management of such patients. Using the data from a recent point-prevalence-day of hypoxemia in ICU, we compare the frequency, management and outcomes of hypoxemia in IS and immuncompetent (IC) patients.</p><p id="Par240"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> The SPECTRUM study was conducted in 117 French-speaking ICUs in 7 countries during spring 2016. IS was retained in case of malignant hemopathy, HIV positivity, immunosuppressive drugs, recent chemotherapy, neutrophil count&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.5 G L.

Hypoxemia was mild in 46 (46%), moderate in 43 (43%) and severe in 10 (10%) IS patients with a similar distribution compared to hypoxemic IC patients. The causes of hypoxemia were also similar pneumonia being the leading cause. 24 (24%) hypoxemic IS patients fulfilled the Berlin criteria for ARDS in a similar proportion to IC patients. Respiratory support used in hypoxemic IS patients was ambient air in 3, low flow oxygen in 24, high flow in 11, NIV in 5 and invasive ventilation in 56 patients, with a different distribution from the IC patients (more patients on high flow therapy and less invasively ventilated).

High dose intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIG), able to neutralize these toxins, are frequently used even tough evidence of its efficacy is not supported by randomized controlled study (RCT). Moreover, IVIG are expensive and possibly harmful. Before conducting a RCT, a pilot study was first designed to assess the feasibility in the context of pediatric critical care.</p><p id="Par260"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A double blinded RCT was performed comparing 2&#x000a0;g&#x000a0;kg of IVIG to isovolumic 4% albumin perfusion within the first 12&#x000a0;h of TSS in children aged between 1&#x000a0;month to 17&#x000a0;years. A priori criteria to determine the feasibility were defined as a rate of inclusion among eligible patients&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;50%, a rate of protocol&#x02019;s deviations&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;30% (treatment delivery, non-respect of blinding, premature stop), and by the practical and financial aspects of the protocol. Secondary objectives were to assess the efficacy of IVIG on organ dysfunction (using Pelod-2 score), on mortality at day 60 and their safety. The study was promoted by the Hospices Civils of Lyon, approved by the CPP Sud-Est and registered at clinical trial (NCT02219165). Inform consent from both parents was required before randomization. This study was funded by CSL-Behring company.</p><p id="Par261"><bold>Results:</bold> During the 30&#x000a0;months study period, 21 patients were included in 9 centers.

Two patients were wrongly included (pneumococcal shocks), one patient didn&#x02019;t receive the treatment because he was transferred for ECMO in a non-investigator center, three patients were treated after 12H, and in two patients one bottle of treatment was missing. The blinding was well respected. Missing data on the Pelod2 score and mortality was lower than 10%, and no premature stop was reported. The eCRF completion was judged easy by investigators. The inclusion of children within the first 12&#x000a0;h was judged challenging. The treatment delivery had to be improved, requiring the help of research assistants. Seven serious and one severe adverse events were registered, all patients recovered and no death was reported.</p><p id="Par262"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This pilot study suggested that a RCT is feasible.

In PICU, data are usually recorded between 5 to 60&#x000a0;min which leads to only a minority of the arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) that are usable to calculate a valid oxygenation index (OI). If not available, PaO2 should be replaced by the SpO2 if&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;98% to calculate the oxygen saturation index (OSI). Using a high temporal resolution (HTR) database that records data every 5&#x02013;30&#x000a0;s, we aim to develop a relevant clinical algorithm of mass data aggregation to improve PARDS screening with the automatic OI and OSI calculation.</p><p id="Par275"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> All the patients admitted to our Pediatric ICU between May 2015 and August 2017 were included.

The OI results differ slightly between the HTR and the EMR. The accuracy is probably in favor of the HTR because of the shorter time-lapse between the OI parameters. The OSI is possibly a biased OI surrogate and should be interpreted with caution.

Despite protocol-based optimization, intradialytic hemodynamic instability (IHI) remains a common complication and could account for mortality and delayed renal recovery. The identification of patients at high risk for IHI is crucial but remains poorly explored. Our objective was to test whether tissue perfusion parameters assessed at the bedside (mottling, index capillary refill time (iCRT), and lactate) predict IHI and to develop and to validate a predictive score of IHI.</p><p id="Par285"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective observational study in a 18-bed medical ICU in a tertiary university hospital including hemodialysis sessions performed for acute kidney injury. Exclusion criteria were patients with dark skin and dialysis performed in extreme emergency. Mean arterial pressure (MAP), mottling score, iCRT, and lactate were recorded just before starting hemodialysis. First episode of IHI requiring therapeutic intervention was recorded 60, 120, and 240&#x000a0;min after hemodialysis starting.</p><p id="Par286"><bold>Results:</bold> Ninety-six hemodialysis sessions performed in 43 patients were recorded. Half of the patients received vasopressors (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;43, 45%).

Thus, a heparin-free easy-to-use anticoagulation within the dialysis circuit is needed but, to date, usual protocols (iterative saline flushes, heparin grafted membranes) lead to 20&#x02013;50% of premature clotting and sessions that last greater than 240&#x000a0;min are rarely achievable. We assessed the safety and efficiency of heparin-free regional citrate anticoagulation of the dialysis circuit using a calcium-free citrate-containing dialysate, with calcium reinjected according to ionic dialysance (an online measure of the instantaneous clearance of small molecules available in most of dialyzers).</p><p id="Par300"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We prospectively reported the clotting events that occurred during all the heparin-free dialysis sessions that were performed with a regional anticoagulation based on calcium-zero citrate-containing dialysate (Citrasate, Hemotech, France) between January 2016 and August 2017 in a 28-beds ICU.</p><p id="Par301"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 186 dialysis sessions were performed in 70 patients (mechanical ventilation n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;93&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;norepinephrine n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20).

When assessed, urea and Beta2-microglobulin reduction rates were 64.5%&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.4% and 48%&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.13%, respectively.

A major clotting event that led to premature termination of the session occurred in only 5186 sessions (2.7%). In these five cases, major catheter dysfunction occurred before clotting within the circuit. Prefilter ionized calcium remained within narrow ranges (before after change +0.07&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.006&#x000a0;mmol L), and total-to-ionized calcium ratio, a surrogate marker for citratemia, was unchanged and always below 2.5.

Calcium reinjection according to ionic dialysance allows prolonged hemodialysis sessions in critically ill patients without the need to systemically monitor ionized calcium.

Confusion was more frequent in STEC-HUS (33%) than aHUS patients (5%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05). Biologically, STEC-HUS patients displayed elevated fibrinogen levels (5.1 vs 3.2 and 3.6 for a HUS and TTP, both p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and severe renal failure. Forty-two percent required renal replacement therapy and 83% were treated with plasma exchange before the distinction from other TMAs could be made.

Epidemiological data reported increased incidence during the past 10&#x000a0;years in Metropolitan France. Most of the cases are asymptomatic or sparsely symptomatic, but some patients develop severe leptospirosis, requiring hospitalisation in intensive care units (ICU). Only few studies exist on severe leptospirosis and data on severe leptospirosis in Europe are very scarce. We performed a retrospective multicentre study in metropolitan France in order to identify the characteristics, treatments and prognostic factors of severe leptospirosis in this context.</p><p id="Par396"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> LeptoRea was a retrospective multicentre study performed in 73 French ICUs.

For each patient, a case report form was completed and hospitals report was sent to the study coordinator (AFM). A descriptive analysis was performed to assess the patients characteristics, treatments received and mortality rate. A univariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with mortality.</p><p id="Par397"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 73 participating ICUs, 26 (35.6%) did not admit any patient with leptospirosis during the study period. 147 patients were included. 90% were male.

However, its role in the post-extubation period, in traumatic brain injury patients, is uncertain. Especially, because of effects of the brain injury, on respiration and airway control. We perform a study to assess the impact of prophylactic NIV after extubation among patients with severe traumatic brain injury.</p><p id="Par406"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Over a period of 1&#x000a0;year, adult patients with isolated severe traumatic brain injury, who were under invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 48&#x000a0;h were eligible for inclusion in the study. They were randomized, after decision of extubation, to receive conventional therapy or conventional therapy associated with NIV. Conventional therapy consisted of oxygen delivery by facial mask, semi-recumbent position, mucus suctioning and nebulization therapy. The main objective of the study is to assess the impact on reintubation rate. Extubation succes was defined by the absence of need for reintubation within the 7&#x000a0;days. The secondary objective is to evaluate the effect on ICU length of stay after extubation.</p><p id="Par407"><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty-three patients ranging in age from 17 to 61&#x000a0;years, were included in the study.

Indeed, in a multicenter randomized trial recently conducted in hypoxemic ARF patients (Pa02 Fi02&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;300), intubation rate in the NIV group was 50% and intensive care unit (ICU) mortality rate was 25%, numbers higher than in the standard-oxygen group (1). An excessive tidal volume under NIV is a hypothesis to explain these bad outcomes (2). Our experience does not seem to support these data. Therefore we wanted to&#x02014;investigate the rate of NIV success in hypoxemic ARF and global in-ICU mortality. Estimate the average expired tidal volume and identify predictive factors of NIV failure.</p><p id="Par411"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Observational cohort study conducted in a medical ICU, including all patients treated with NIV for hypoxemic ARF over a 3&#x000a0;years period.</p><p id="Par412"><bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, 57 patients were included (mean age 57.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15.1&#x000a0;years, median SAPS II 43 (29&#x02013;54), median Pa02 Fi02 151 (111&#x02013;186)) and 23 had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Intubation rate was 28.1% and in-ICU mortality was 14%. Patients with a Pa02 Fi02 ratio&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;150 during the first NIV session had a mortality rate five times higher than those with a Pa02 Fi02&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;150 (37.5 vs 7.3% p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.047). More than 2000&#x000a0;h of NIV were analysed. Median expired tidal volume was 10&#x000a0;ml/kg of predicted body weight (PBT) (8&#x02013;11&#x000a0;ml/kg PBT), whether the patients were intubated (NIF failure) or not (NIV success). In multivariate analysis, only the presence of ARDS was independently associated with NIV failure.</p><p id="Par413"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> With a success rate of 71.9% and a mortality rate of 14% it seems legitimate not to exclude VNI of the management of patients with hypoxemic ARF.

A NIV local procedure, based on current guidelines, is available in the investigating centre, but UE is not mentioned. The decision to perform NIV in this setting was only based on the attending physician&#x02019;s judgment. All patients experiencing an UE were included. We registered demographic data, patient&#x02019;s characteristics and evolution after UE according to the occurrence of NIV. Prophylactic NIV denoted NIV performed after extubation without sign of respiratory failure, whereas curative NIV was a mean to treat post extubation respiratory failure.</p><p id="Par417"><bold>Results:</bold> 106 UE occurred during the study period. Age was 59.4 [41.1&#x02013;74.4] years, SAPS II 45 [36&#x02013;54]. Reintubation was needed in 30 cases, within 1.8 [0.33&#x02013;21.5] hours after UE, mostly for acute respiratory failure (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25). The death was associated with the need for reintubation (10 30 vs 0 76, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). NIV was performed in 21 cases. In all but 8 patients, NIV was used to treat an acute respiratory failure, the remaining indications being described as preventive of reintubation without evidence of respiratory failure. Respiratory failure as an indication for NIV was more often associated with reintubation (10/13 vs. 1/8, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.008). NIV was also associated with death (5/21 vs. 5/85, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). As a comparison, during the same period, 536 patients ventilated at least 48&#x000a0;h had a planned extubation (age 67 [54&#x02013;80] years, SAPS II 49 [35&#x02013;62]). Regarding NIV in this subgroup, data were available in 438 patients. NIV was used 141 times, with prophylactic NIV being more frequent (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;118) as compared to rescue NIV (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23). Reintubation rates were similar as compared to UE patients for prophylactic NIV (16 118 vs. 1 8, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.94) and rescue NIV (9 23 vs. 10 13, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.26).</p><p id="Par418"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Though limited by its design, our study seems to show a similar efficacy of NIV following UE as compared to planned extubation, with a safety concern for rescue NIV and a potential interest for &#x0201c;prophylactic&#x0201d; NIV.

Recent studies on stable obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) patients have risen concern about hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia in this population, but many questions remain unanswered. How important is this risk in acute care? Is there a risk in non-OHS obese patients as well? This study aims to evaluate the risk of hyperoxia-induced hypercapnia in post-op obese cardiac surgery patients.</p><p id="Par426"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> 30 obese patients (BMI&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;30) having coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) are currently being recruited. Informed written consent is obtained before inclusion. With a crossover design, we are comparing two oxygenation strategies immediately after extubation, in terms of their effect on arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2)&#x02014;a peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) target of&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;95% achieved with manual titration (control period) and a SpO2 target of 90% achieved with automatic titration by a closed-loop system (FreeO2 period). Every patient is delivered oxygen according to both strategies for 30&#x000a0;min each, in a randomized order. FreeO2 (Oxynov, Qu&#x000e9;bec, Canada) is a closed-loop oxygen delivery system which titrates oxygen flow according to the patient&#x02019;s real-time SpO2 and a target set by the physician. SpO2, oxygen flow and heart rate are continuously recorded by FreeO2 during both periods. Hemodynamic parameters are checked at 10&#x000a0;min intervals and arterial blood gases are collected at the end of each period. The primary outcome is the change in PaCO2 between periods.</p><p id="Par427"><bold>Results:</bold> 17 patients have been included so far and data for 16 patients are presented here. 13 are men, mean age is 60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;years and mean BMI is 34&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup>. 9 patients are responders, as shown by an elevation in PaCO2 in control period compared to FreeO2 period, and 7 patients are non-responders. Two distinct oxygenation profiles are being studied (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig15" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The mean SpO2 for FreeO2 period is 91.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.3% while it is 97.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.4% for control period. Mean oxygen flow is 0.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.7 L min for FreeO2 period (equivalent to&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;24% FiO2) while mean FiO2 is 51&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;10% for control period.<fig id="Fig15"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Percentage of time in different saturation ranges per period</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig15_HTML" id="MO23"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par428"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> FreeO2 is helpful in maintaining oxygenation within target. High SpO2 values may cause an elevation in PaCO2 in obese patients after CABG, but more analyses are required for this outcome.

Asynchronisms are currently diagnosed by direct bedside ventilatory curves analysis, which is yet operator dependent and time-consuming, or by invasive methods including esophageal pressure or diaphragmatic electromyogram measurements. The main purpose of this study was to assess the relevance of Curvex as a noninvasive diagnostic and classification tool for asynchronism management.</p><p id="Par431"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This project is based on a prospective physiological tracing data-warehousing program (Rea STOC, clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02893462) that aims to record 1500 consecutive ICU patients, over 3-years. All consecutive patients were recorded for a 2-hours period during 24-h following ICU admission. All measurements were recorded with the patient laying supine, with a 30&#x000b0; bed angulation. Raw ventilatory pressure and flow curves were transferred to a centralized server using a dedicated network. The physician in charge of the study was informed of the online analysis on a routine basis. Physiological recordings were associated with metadata collection. Asynchronisms detection is based on a non-parametric hypothesis testing (Random Distortion Testing), that requires no prior information on the signal distribution. Beside Asynchrony Index monitoring (AI), five asynchronism&#x02019;s types were qualified&#x02014;ineffective efforts (IE), short cycles (SC), multiple cycles (MC), prolonged inspiration (PI) and premature cycling (PC).</p><p id="Par432"><bold>Results:</bold> 72 patients were included (age 61.2&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13.8&#x000a0;yr&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;52 male 20 female&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;SAPS II 53.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.4), of whom 15 with chronic respiratory diseases.

IE were the most frequent asynchronisms (39.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;28.6%). Concordance between visual and automatic evaluation was 97.2%. An attempt to reduce AI according to a standardized protocol was performed in 56/72 patients. Significant AI reduction (&#x02265;&#x000a0;10%) was observed for only 10 patients (mean AI reduction&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.9%).

Although some diplomas are welcome (Master 2, for instance), prerequisites to become a fellow are limited to graduation in a specialized medical degree, and a medical thesis. Hence, fellows in the ICU may have a very varied background. We therefore decided to perform a survey of the scientific, clinical and educational training of intensive care medicine fellows, at the dawn of a new degree in intensive care medicine, and analyse heterogeneity causes.</p><p id="Par441"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a national survey among the current and former fellows (2014&#x02013;2017) of French medical and mixed critical care units, with an electronic questionnaire.</p><p id="Par442"><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred and fifty-seven current and former fellows were contacted, among whom 123 (78%) responded (age&#x02014;33&#x000a0;years [32&#x02013;35], men 60.2%)&#x02014;56.9% completed a complementary degree in intensive care, while 37% were on their way to graduate.

Naive HCWs received a training (course and hands-on). Right Internal Jugular Vein (RIJV) and Right Axillary Vein (RAV) with either linear probe (LP) [HFL38, with the M-Turbo<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sonosite, Bothewell, MA], or micro-convex probe (MCP) [GE8C, with a Vivid 7<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, General Electric, 78457 Velizy, France] using IP and OOP approaches were performed on an inanimate manikin (Blue Phantom II, CAE Healthcare St. Louis, MO).

Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) in clinical conditions or high fidelity simulation (HFS) represents a highly stressful medical situation. Stress measurement and its correlation to technical and non-technical performances could be a tool to improve teaching methods. Heart rate variability (HRV) is mediated by the autonomic nervous system and a lower HRV reflects parasympathetic inhibition therefore it could reflects stress. The aim of this study was to validate the feasibility of objective stress measurement by heart HRV monitoring during CA in HFS. Analyzing the relation between ANI, self-reported stress and performance was the second objective.</p><p id="Par452"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> An open monocentric prospective study was conducted from December 2015 to December 2016 in Lille&#x02019;s medical simulation center PRESAGE. Intensive care residents from Lille Medical University played team leader in a CA scenario. Objective stress was measured from recordings of three leads electrocardiogram portable device (PhysioDoloris<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> monitor, MDoloris Lille, France). HRV was obtained by analyzing time interval between successive R waves and transformed in the Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI). ANI gives both a qualitative and quantitative measurement of HRV. Self-reported stress was assessed with a visual analog scale (VAS). Results were expressed in numbers (%), mean (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;Standard Derivation). Correlations were tested using the non-parametric Spearman rank test (Rho). p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05 was considered significant.</p><p id="Par453"><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-four intensive care residents were monitored for HRV in simulation training. 36 signals (56.3%) were fully interpretable. Team leader&#x02019;s self-reported pre-HFS stress VAS was 43.3 (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;22.4) and maximal stress VAS was 58.7 (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;21.7). Team leaders&#x02019; maximal heart rate was 157&#x000a0;bpm (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;20). Minimal ANI, reflecting intense stress was 33.7 (&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.9). Objective and subjective stress of each team leader is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig16" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. There was a significant negative linear correlation between minimal ANI and maximal HR (Rho&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;0.52, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). There was no significant correlation between self-reported stress VAS (neither pre HFS or maximal stress) and minimal ANI.<fig id="Fig16"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Team leader&#x02019;s objective (heart rate and ANI) and subjective stress (declared VAS stress)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig16_HTML" id="MO24"/></fig>

Adequacy was defined when all bacteria responsible for infection were sensitive to at least one prescribed proposed antibiotic. National guidelines were used when published after 2011. Otherwise, most recent international guidelines were used.</p><p id="Par468"><bold>Results:</bold> 120 initial prescriptions were analyzed (45 monotherapy) in 97 patients (median age 63y, median SAPS II 53, median SOFA on prescription 7, ICU mortality 41%, 17% immunocompromised). Main sources of infection were lung (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;75) and intra-abdominal (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23). Leading isolated bacteria were Enterobacteriaceae (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;67, antibiotic resistance in 14), Streptococci (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55), non-fermenting Gram negative bacilli (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;27, antibiotic resistance in 12) and Staphylococci (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;25, resistance to methicillin in 5).

It is now acknowledged that a seated position allows for optimized preoxygenation (1). However, there is no guideline concerning the patient&#x02019;s position for intubation. The patient is most often laid in a supine position, leading to a higher risk of aspiration (2). Face-to-face intubation in sitting position (FtFi) would allow for an easier intubation and a lower morbidity. We focused on learning the FtFi technique using the Macintosh laryngoscope and the Airtraq videolaryngoscope in simulated difficult intubation situation and comparing the performance of the FtFi with the classic technique.</p><p id="Par472"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> The participants would intubate a high-fidelity manikin (SimMan3G, Leardal, Norway) configured with a tongue edema (Cormack 2b-3). For each trial, time to intubate (TTI), success and complication rate, intubation difficulty and glottis exposure were noted. In classic position, three trials were performed with the Airtraq followed by the laryngoscope in order to obtain baseline parameters. In FtFi, at least 30 intubations were performed by each participant for each device. The utilization order was randomized.</p><p id="Par473"><bold>Results:</bold> Thirty physicians, with an experience of at least 200 intubations each, were included. Figure shows the learning curves of the FtFi based on the evolution of the TTI measured for the Airtraq and the laryngoscope. In classic position, the mean TTI with the Airtraq was 30.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;19.1&#x000a0;s versus 27.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;16.7&#x000a0;s with the laryngoscope (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;ns). In FtFi, once the technique mastered, the TTI was 14&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.9&#x000a0;s with the Airtraq versus 17.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.4&#x000a0;s with the laryngoscope (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). Success rate, TTI, complication rate, intubation difficulty and glottis exposure were better using FtFi versus classic intubation (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). These parameters were even better with the Airtraq than with the laryngoscope (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figj_HTML" id="MO26"/>
</p><p id="Par474"><bold>Discussion:</bold> The learning profile of FtFi is different between the Airtraq and the laryngoscope. It could be due to the participants&#x02019; lesser familiarity with the Airtraq. The better performances in FtFi could be due to better ergonomics allowing easier glottis exposure and learning (3).</p><p id="Par475"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Face-to-face intubation in sitting position is easy to learn. It provides better performances and fewer complications than the classic intubation technique which might result in a lower morbidity. The Airtraq provides even better results than Macintosh laryngoscope. All participants recommend their colleagues to be trained in face-to-face intubation.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec375"><title>F-15 Non invasive ventilation use for Acute Chest Syndrome in French speaking Pediatric Intensive Care Units, online survey</title><sec id="Sec376"><title>Heilbronner Claire<sup>1</sup>, Grimaud Marion<sup>1</sup>, Oualha Mehdi<sup>1</sup>, Sommet Julie<sup>1</sup>, Rambaud Jerome<sup>1</sup>, Brousse Valentine<sup>1</sup>, Allali Slimane<sup>1</sup>, Renolleau Sylvain<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec377"><title><sup>1</sup>Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec378"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Heilbronner Claire - claire.heilbronner@aphp.fr</title><p id="Par476"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-15</p><p id="Par477"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Acute chest syndrome (ACS) is the leading reason of admission in Pediatric Intensive Care unit (PICU) for patients with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD).

For patients who observed an ACS&#x02014;bronchodilatators nebulisations were administrated in 47 (34%) of them, incentive spirometry was performed by 94 patients and 64 (47%) received standard oxygen therapy. Among non-invasive respiratory support, NIV with bilevel pressure was the most frequent (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;68, 50%) before CPAP (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;23, 17%) and high flow oxygen (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21, 15%). The proportion of patients on NIV was up to 71% in the centres hosting more ACS patients.</p><p id="Par480"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Despite the absence of evidence from randomized controlled trials NIV is nowadays commonly used in PICU and HDU for SCD patients with ACS, especially in centres taking in charge a high number of SCD patients. Future physiological studies and randomized controlled trials might help to choose between the different ventilatory support options for ACS.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec379"><title>F-16 Transfusion practices in children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective cohort study</title><sec id="Sec380"><title>Emeriaud Guillaume<sup>1</sup>, Paquin Marie-Eve<sup>1</sup>, Shemyakina Ilona<sup>1</sup>, De Cloedt Lise<sup>1</sup>, Tucci Marisa<sup>1</sup>, Lacroix Jacques<sup>1</sup>, Jouvet Philippe<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec381"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU Sainte Justine, Universit&#x000e9; de Montr&#x000e9;al, Montr&#x000e9;al, Canada</title><sec id="Sec382"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Emeriaud Guillaume - guillaume.emeriaud@umontreal.ca</title><p id="Par481"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-16</p><p id="Par482"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Restrictive transfusion practices are increasingly used in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), but evidence is lacking for deciding transfusion in children with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS).

Lung protective strategies in ARDS advocate using low tidal volume and high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) while limiting the inspiratory plateau pressure in the recent international consensus conference on PARDS (PALICC)<sup>1</sup>. Our objectives were to evaluate the adherence to the guidelines for lung protective ventilation proposed by the PALICC and determine whether variations in tidal volume were related to the severity of oxygenation impairment.</p><p id="Par488"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> All patients, admitted to our tertiary pediatric ICU from January 2013 to May 2015, who received conventional ventilation for severe PARDS using PALICC definition and who had data to calculate ideal body weight (IBW) were retrospectively included. We excluded children with pulmonary bronchodysplasia and those admitted after cardiac surgery. Expiratory tidal volume (VTe), PEEP, peak inspiratory pressure, mean airway pressure, FiO2 and PaO2 were collected from electronic medical record (ICCA, Philips), using SQL Server 2008 (Microsoft, USA)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;data were collected for 10&#x000a0;days following onset of conventional mechanical ventilation.

Mortality rate was 38% (8/21) with a median duration of mechanical ventilation of 10&#x000a0;days ([IQR]&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;7&#x02013;32&#x000a0;days). On 1780 measurements of respiratory parameters, 72% of VTe measurements were&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;8.0&#x000a0;mL&#x000a0;kg with median VTe of 6.7&#x000a0;mL&#x000a0;kg ([IQR]&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;5.6&#x02013;8.3). During the first 10&#x000a0;days of conventional mechanical ventilation (159 patient-days), there were a significant variations in the daily rates of adherence to low tidal volume ventilation (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) and a significant decrease in VTe with the highest oxygenation index (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02).</p><p id="Par490"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our centre, adherence to PALICC guidelines for low tidal volume ventilation in PARDS is not perfect.

A third of the cohort attained the target, according to our dosing regimen and to the European guidelines. To reach the target and according to the simulated dosing regimens, children with acute kidney injury should receive intermittent infusion every 6&#x000a0;h, administered on 30&#x000a0;min.

Its effectiveness in preventing endotracheal intubation and reducing intensive care mortality is undeniable. Few studies have evaluated the relationship between ventilation modalities (noninvasive ventilation [NIV] versus invasive mechanical ventilation [IMV] and long-term survival in COPD patients treated in the intensive care unit (ICU).

</p><p id="Par540"><bold>Discussion:</bold> In spite of the sample size and of the voluntary character of this survey, these data indicate an ample room for improvement of the awareness of PICS in our ICU. The knowledge of the specific tests used for the assessment of PICS is mostly determined by the professional background. Hence, the implementation of a follow-up clinic is challenging as it requires educational training. Large similar projects have been successful after intensive training and awareness campaigns.</p><p id="Par541"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Knowledge of PICS is poor in the absence of training and education. Post-ICU follow-up clinics require skill and motivation from a large variety of ICU healthcare workers.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec427"><title>F-28 Evaluation of death certificates drafted in emergency and intensive care departments</title><sec id="Sec428"><title>Wiem Ben Amar<sup>1</sup>, Zribi Malek<sup>1</sup>, Ennouri Hassen<sup>1</sup>, Karray Narjess<sup>1</sup>, Bardaa Sami<sup>1</sup>, Hammami Zouheir<sup>1</sup>, Maatoug Samir<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec429"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Habib Bourguiba, Sfax, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec430"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Wiem Ben Amar - wiembenamar@yahoo.fr</title><p id="Par542"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-28</p><p id="Par543"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Drafting a death certificate (DC) is a procedure considered as a part of doctor&#x02019;s daily practice, especially in emergency and intensive care departments.

Although confidential, the medical part of the DC was sealed by the doctor in onlyone third of cases. In the administrative section, nine socio-demographic parameters were studied. In 10% of the cases, less than four of the nine criteria were found. In the section concerning the certifying doctor data, 7 parameters were screened. 67.1% of the certifying doctors met at least six criteria. The most frequently missing parameter in this section was the identity of the person to whom the certificate was issued. The identity of the doctor was not mentioned in 10% of the cases. Forensic data (4 items) was complete in over three quarters of the certificates. Nevertheless, in 26.7% of cases, the medicolegal obstacle to burial box was left empty (8.3%) or not ticked even if judicial investigation was required (18.3%). The section on causes of death was the source of almost all of the drafting errors. We have classified these errors into six major ones, according the classifications reported in the literature. The percentage of certificate without faults was 13%. The most common major error was insufficient cause of death found in 40.4% of cases followed by incorrect sequence of causes of death (28.8%), medicolegal obstacle to burial not ticked although required (26.6%), several causes of death mentioned simultaneously (16.7%), unacceptable cause of death (10.8%) and mechanism of death mentioned instead of the cause of death (5.8%).</p><p id="Par546"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study showed that the quality of drafting of DC suffered from several insufficiencies, which encourages us to provide more effort in training doctors and to review the current official model of DC.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec431"><title>F-29 Validation of a delocalized measurement method of lactate for septic patients</title><sec id="Sec432"><title>Jouffroy Romain<sup>1</sup>, Leguillier Teddy<sup>1</sup>, Boisson Marie<sup>1</sup>, Boussaroque Agathe<sup>1</sup>, Nivet Antoine Val&#x000e9;rie<sup>1</sup>, Beaudeux Jean Louis<sup>1</sup>, Vivien Benoit<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec433"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec434"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Jouffroy Romain - romain.jouffroy@gmail.com</title><p id="Par547"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-29</p><p id="Par548"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Septic shock is defined as a sepsis with hyperlactaemia greater than 2&#x000a0;mM after correction of hypovolemia requiring vasopressors to maintain MBP&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;65&#x000a0;mmHg [1].

Prognosis of comatose patient relies on multimodal testing&#x02014;clinical examination, electrophysiological testing and structural neuroimaging (mainly diffusion MRI). This prognostication is accurate for predicting poor outcome (i.e. death) but not sensitive for identifying patients with good outcome (i.e. consciousness recovery). Resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a powerful tool for mapping functional connectivity, especially in patients with low collaboration. Several studies showed that rs-fMRI can differentiate states of consciousness in chronically brain-damaged patients. A recent study also showed that functional neuroimaging can early detect signs of consciousness in patient with acute traumatic brain injury. However, rs-fMRI has not been assessed for the early prognostication of post-anoxic comatose patient.</p><p id="Par574"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We assessed whole-brain function connectivity (FC) of 17 post-anoxic comatose patients early after CA using rs-fMRI. Nine patients ultimately recovered consciousness (good outcome) while eight died (poor outcome). We estimated FC for each patient following a procedure previously described. We statistically compared whole-brain FC between good and poor outcome group, to assess which brain connections differed between them. Then, we trained a machine-learning classifier (a Support Vector Machine, SVM) to automatically predict coma outcome (good poor) based on whole-brain FC of comatose patients. Finally, we compared this outcome prognostication based on functional MRI to those using standard structural diffusion MRI.</p><p id="Par575"><bold>Results:</bold> Good and poor coma outcome groups were similar in terms of demographics, except for time to ROSC. Good outcome group showed significant increase in whole-brain FC between most cortical brain regions&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;with the strongest changes occurring within and between occipital and parietal, temporal and frontal regions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig22" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Using whole-brain FC and a SVM classifier to predict coma outcome yielded to an overall prediction accuracy of 94.4%(AUC 0.94). Interestingly, automatic outcome prognostication using functional neuroimaging achieved better results that structural neuroimaging methods like DWI (accuracy 70.6%).<fig id="Fig22"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Outcomes of post-anoxic comatose patients early after CA, using rs-fMRI</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig22_HTML" id="MO1000120"/></fig></p><p id="Par576"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We used rs-fMRI to predict coma outcome in a cohort of post-anoxic comatose patients early after CA. We deliberately chose to include only patients with indeterminate prognosis after standard multimodal testing, to assess the contribution of rs-fMRI in the early prognostication of coma outcome. We found that automatic prediction based on functional neuroimaging yielded much better results than current DWI methods, notably for identifying patients who recovered consciousness.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec455"><title>F-35 Neurological Pupil index for early neuroprognostication</title><sec id="Sec456"><title>Miroz John-Paul<sup>1</sup>, Solari Daria<sup>1</sup>, Eckert Philippe<sup>1</sup>, Oddo Mauro<sup>1</sup>, Ben-Hamouda Nawfel<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec457"><title><sup>1</sup>Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV), Lausanne, Switzerland</title><sec id="Sec458"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Miroz John-Paul - John-Paul.Miroz@chuv.ch</title><p id="Par577"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-35</p><p id="Par578"><bold>Introduction:</bold> ECMO is increasingly used in critical care.

A recent systematic review (Weiss et al. Crit Care 2017) reported a significant heterogeneity in endpoints used in RCTs comparing treatment of severe pneumonia that may influence their ability to demonstrate differences between studied drugs. Clinical cure was the most frequently used endpoint but its definition was highly variable. These results are not surprising as far as even guidance from regulatory agencies on how to evaluate HAP VAP treatments differ. The aim of this work was to reach a consensus on the most appropriate endpoint to consider in future clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of antimicrobial treatment for HAP VAP, using Delphi method.</p><p id="Par584"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Twenty-six international experts from intensive care, infectious disease and from the industry were consulted using Delphi method (four successive questionnaires) from January 2016 to January 2017. More than 70% of similar answers to a question were necessary to reach a consensus.</p><p id="Par585"><bold>Results:</bold> According to 60% the experts, clinical cure was the most desirable primary outcome among those found in the literature but two other endpoints were highly rated&#x02014;all-cause mortality and mechanical ventilation (MV)-free days. Consequently, 88% of the panelists agreed to use a composite endpoints and even a hierarchical composite endpoint to combine these items together in which clinical cure and MV-free days would be assessed at day 28 and clinical cure at day 7 after end of therapy. For VAP, mortality was considered as the most clinically significant item by 75% of the experts, followed by MV-free days and finally clinical cure (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). For HAP, a dual composite endpoint that only included all-cause mortality and clinical cure was chosen (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig23" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). Among the various elements of clinical cure definition found in the literature, only three were retained by the experts&#x02014;resolution at end of therapy of signs and symptoms present at enrolment, no further antimicrobial treatment needed and resolution or lack of progression of radiological signs of pneumonia. Finally, we found a consensus on the signs and symptoms that should trigger the suspicion of pneumonia&#x02014;worsening of gaz exchange, purulent tracheal secretions, hypotension and or vasopressor requirements and fever or hypothermia.<fig id="Fig23"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Clinically significant endpoints of hospital-acquired (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig23_HTML" id="MO1000121"/></fig></p><p id="Par586"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We provide here two consensual endpoints (for VAP and HAP) that would help addressing the efficacy of antimicrobial molecules for HAP VAP treatment in future clinical trials.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec463"><title>F-37 Ventilator associated pneumonia due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: risk factors and outcome</title><sec id="Sec464"><title>Merceron Sybille<sup>1</sup>, Ibn Saied Wafa<sup>1</sup>, Schwebel Carole<sup>1</sup>, Le Monnier Alban<sup>1</sup>, Garrouste-Orgeas Mait&#x000e9;<sup>1</sup>, Marcotte Guillaume<sup>1</sup>, Ruckly St&#x000e9;phane<sup>1</sup>, Souweine Bertrand<sup>1</sup>, Darmon Michael<sup>1</sup>, De Montmollin Etienne<sup>1</sup>, Mourvillier Bruno<sup>1</sup>, Reignier Jean<sup>1</sup>, Papazian Laurent<sup>1</sup>, Siami Shidasp<sup>1</sup>, Azoulay Elie<sup>1</sup>, B&#x000e9;dos Jean-Pierre<sup>1</sup>, Timsit Jean-Fran&#x000e7;ois<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec465"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Le Chesnay, Versailles, France</title><sec id="Sec466"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Merceron Sybille - sybille07@gmail.com</title><p id="Par587"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-37</p><p id="Par588"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM) is a Gram negative bacteria rarely involved in ICU acquired infections. Empirical treatment is challenging, as SM is resistant for almost all clinically-relevant antibiotics.

Identifying risk factors for SM-VAP could be useful.</p><p id="Par589"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in a multicenter database in France. VAP was determined as microbiologically documented pneumonia occurring after at least two days of mechanical ventilation. All patients admitted from 2000 to 2015 presenting at least one episode of VAP were included. SM-VAP were compared with VAP due to other micro-organisms (VAP-other). To assess risk factors and day-30 (D30) mortality, SM-VAP were matched (1&#x000a0;&#x02212;&#x000a0;n) with VAP-other based on center, time from ICU admission to VAP occurrence, and SAPS II score.</p><p id="Par590"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 20 968 patients included, 1 659 presented at least one episode of VAP.

Median length of stay in ICU was longer in SM-VAP (Table). 93 SM-VAP were matched with 380 control patients. In univariate analysis, risk factors for SM-VAP were&#x02014;male gender, chronic heart failure, respiratory, cardiovascular and coagulation SOFA scores two days before VAP, median number of antibiotics used, percentage of time with antibiotics before VAP, parenteral nutrition, dialysis, catecholamine use and exposure to Ureido-carboxypenicillin, Ciprofloxacin, Tazobactam or Imipenem-Meropenem during the week before VAP (Table). Patients with SM-VAP were less likely to receive initial adequate therapy (56 vs 70%, OR 0.53, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). There was no statistical difference for ICU or D30 mortality. D60 mortality was higher for SM-VAP (Table).

On first year, students had access to a theoretical formation then were convened by groups for a demonstration of the correct execution of world health organization&#x02019;s (WHO) procedure [3]. Before HH training, each group underwent a cluster randomization. In the control group, the student hand rubbed under visual supervision and advises of a trainer. In the intervention group after the same visual assessment, completeness of AHR hand application was recorded under UV light and shown to the student. He was given free access to the UV cabinet to repeat the technique, until perfect application complete under UV light. An enhancement with a scenario-based learning was proposed to both groups. On second year, every student were asked to hand rub with the fluorescent AHR.

Among these 57 patients, 7 (1.2%) acquired the ESBL-E fecal carriage during their stay in the ICU. No cross-transmission of ESBL-E occurred (as assessed by PFGE analysis) even for ICU-acquired fecal carriage. ESBL genes were found to be mostly from the CTX-M group mainly CTX-M group 1 (36 57) enhancing the community origin of the ESBL-E fecal carriage even in ICU. ESBL-E caused infections occurred in 5 57 patients always consisting in ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by the colonizing strain.</p><p id="Par608"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Hygiene isolation procedures seem to be well applied in our units as we do not have any ESBL-E fecal carriage cross transmission case. But still cases of ICU-acquired ESBL-E fecal carriage occurred suggesting an endogenous origin in a non-outbreak situation. Therefore, the mechanisms of ESBL-E expansion in the community and of endogenous ESBL-E acquisition in ICU are still to investigate.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec479"><title>F-41 Bloodstream infections in adults undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: epidemiology and risk factors</title><sec id="Sec480"><title>Perrin Caroline<sup>1</sup>, Conil Jean-Marie<sup>1</sup>, Georges Bernard<sup>1</sup>, Seguin Thierry<sup>1</sup>, Crognier Laure<sup>1</sup>, Fourcade Olivier<sup>1</sup>, Bounes Fanny<sup>1</sup>, Minville Vincent<sup>1</sup>, Silva Stein<sup>1</sup>, Delmas Cl&#x000e9;ment<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec481"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU de Toulouse, France</title><sec id="Sec482"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Perrin Caroline - perrincaroline@hotmail.fr</title><p id="Par609"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-41</p><p id="Par610"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Detection of nosocomial infections (NIs) occurring during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is difficult and their related side effects appear to contribute to the high mortality rates (40&#x02013;50%) of these patients.

Cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction may result in insufficient dosage and subsequent therapeutic inefficiency of the patients&#x02019; co-treatments including the anticonvulsive drugs administered to treat the SE. Our objective was to describe the anticonvulsive drugs administered to SE patients and determine the resulting theoretical risk of drug&#x02013;drug interactions with the patients&#x02019; treatments.</p><p id="Par621"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Patients admitted during 1&#x000a0;year (Jan&#x02013;Dec 2016) in our University Hospital intensive care unit (ICU) were selected using the Program of Medicalization of the Information system (PMSI). The usual demographic, clinical, and outcome data were collected with a special focus at the patients&#x02019; treatments taken before ICU admission and treatments administered during the ICU stay including the anticonvulsive drugs. We used the table of drug&#x02013;drug interactions of the Geneva University Hospitals (1) and the DrugBank website (2) to determine the risks of drug&#x02013;drug interactions.</p><p id="Par622"><bold>Results:</bold> Sixty-one patients (74% males 26% females&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;age&#x02014;56&#x000a0;years [16&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;92] (median [percentiles 25, 75]) were included in this study. Patients were chronic alcoholics (41%) and drug users (16%). The following anticonvulsive drugs were administered&#x02014;levetiracetam (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;46, 75%), fosphenytoine (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40, 66%), clonazepam (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37, 61%), clobazam (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28, 46%), midazolam (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22, 36%), valproic acid (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10, 16%), carbamazepine (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7, 12%) and phenobarbital (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7, 12%). Among the 46 61 patients (77%) treated with a CYP inducer, 26 patients (63%) received at least one drug with liver metabolism of which plasma concentrations might have been altered by such potential drug&#x02013;drug interactions, thus representing 43% of the SE patients admitted to the ICU. Drugs at risk of pharmacokinetic alterations were cardiovascular, metabolic and psychotropic drugs.</p><p id="Par623"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Drugs with potential risk of drug&#x02013;drug interactions used to treat SE patients in the ICU are relatively frequent.

Numerous pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies have been investigated for delirium treatment without success. Therefore delirium prevention strategies are recommended by current critical care practice guidelines. Among the potentially modifiable risk factors for delirium, the impact of daylight exposure on delirium incidence and or duration has not been studied. The objective of this study was to investigate whether daylight exposition would reduce delirium burden in critically ill patients.</p><p id="Par644"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a prospective study in a 27-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU) over a 1-year period (January 2016&#x02013;January 2017). All consecutive adult patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) for 2&#x000a0;days or more were eligible for the study. Patients were assigned to a room with windows allowing daylight exposure (&#x0201c;Light&#x0201d; group) or without window (&#x0201c;Dark&#x0201d; group), depending on bed availability. Delirium was evaluated with the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) for a maximum period of 28&#x000a0;days. Delirium was defined by a ICDSC score&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;4 for two consecutive days. Agitation was defined by a RASS&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;or&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;+2.

Guidelines for the management of refractory generalized CSE currently recommend general anesthesia for 24&#x02013;48&#x000a0;h, followed by gradual withdrawal. Our objective is to evaluate the incidence of refractory generalized CSE among patients who required MV during pre-hospital management of status epilepticus, and to describe the management of general anesthesia in intensive care unit (ICU).</p><p id="Par649"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This ongoing multicenter retrospective observational study is conducted in 4 French ICUs. All patients admitted in ICU under mechanical ventilation between 01-01-2014 and 12-31-2016 with disease-code &#x0201c;Status Epilepticus&#x0201d; are included.

In many ICUs, cirrhotic patients are widely admitted and revalued after receiving optimal treatments. Little is known about risk factors involved in the evaluation of the prognosis at day 3, except the persistence of organ failure. This susceptibility to organ failure would be related to an alteration of the regulation mechanisms of the systemic inflammatory response. The blood neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an inflammation biomarker reported to predict clinical outcome in unselected critically ill patients and in patients with stable liver cirrhosis, but has never been studied in critically ill cirrhotic patients.

Four of these nine patients were subsequently transplanted. At the time of LT, all had PT levels lower than 10%, a marked rise in bilirubin levels and required support for at least one organ (or x organs were involved). Histological findings on the explanted livers demonstrated massive or sub-massive necrosis and little potential for effective mitosis with a mitonecrotic appearance.

The indication for liver transplantation is based on an evolving dynamic. The lack of any signs of an improvement in liver function at or after D3, in patients presenting with other organ dysfunctions or failure, means that liver transplantation should be envisaged. The peculiar histological features observed on all the explanted livers, and the aspect of abortive mitoses in hepatocytes could be attributed to the effects of heatstroke.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec527"><title>F-53 Should we use Prometheus for fulminant hepatitis ?</title><sec id="Sec528"><title>Roubin Johanna<sup>1</sup>, Kelway Charlotte<sup>2</sup>, Nafati Cyril<sup>2</sup>, Reydellet Laurent<sup>2</sup>, Blasco Valery<sup>2</sup>, Harti Karim<sup>2</sup>, Cungi Pierre Julien<sup>2</sup>, Albanese Jacques<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec529"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital de la Timone, Marseille, France; <sup>2</sup>CHU de Toulon, France</title><sec id="Sec530"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Roubin Johanna - roubinjohanna@gmail.com</title><p id="Par672"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-53</p><p id="Par673"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Without any treatment, patients with fulminant hepatitis die in 70 to 90% of cases.

Specific scales for non-communicative patients have been developed and validated but their routine use still remains inaccurate and subjective. Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) is based on high-frequency heart rate variability. This study objective was to assess the correlation between the Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS) and ANI during care procedures in deeply sedated patients.</p><p id="Par696"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conduced a French multicentric prospective observational study with blinded continuous recording of ANI during 8&#x000a0;h with spotting of care procedures in patients with RASS less or equal to &#x02212;&#x000a0;2. We compared pain assessment using BPS and ANI before (t1) and during (t2) each care procedure. The cares analyzed included prick glycaemia, turning, catheter insertion, dressing change and others. A behavioral pain reactivity (BPR) was defined by a BPS elevation of at least 1 point. We analyzed minimal ANI values and its variations with calculation of DeltaANI (ANIt1&#x02013; ANIt2).

Our goal was to assess the impact of the introduction of a nurses-dedicated sedation protocol in our ICU.</p><p id="Par742"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This monocentre retrospective before-after study included all the patients admitted in our ICU, over two three-month periods, from July 2015 and January 2016, treated with invasive mechanical ventilation for more than 24&#x000a0;h and older than 18yrs. After the first period, all physicians and nurses were trained to a new sedation management protocol.

Their constantly evolving medical condition warrants continuous reevaluation and adjustments in pharmacotherapy. Multiple studies have shown the impact of pharmacist&#x02019;s interventions on the reduction of medication prescription errors and extrapolated hypothetic cost savings. Critical care societies around the world recommend full time specialized clinical pharmacy services in the intensive care unit (ICU). Nonetheless, the full impact of specialized clinical pharmacy in the critical care unit should be appreciated in terms of meaningful direct patient outcomes such as length of ICU stay, length of mechanical ventilation (MV), risk of MV associated pneumonia or other nosocomial infections, risk of delirium, thromboembolic events or mortality and direct actual expenditure savings.</p><p id="Par747"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Literature review (PubMed, google scholar and cross-referencing of selected articles) with selected Mesh terms (Intensive Care Units [Mesh] OR Critical Illness [Mesh] OR Resuscitation [Mesh]) AND (Pharmacists [Mesh] OR Pharmacy [Mesh]) done on August 28th, 2017.

Eighty-eight percent of the studies were done in the USA and 31% were prospective trials (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1348 patients). Six studies evaluated actual monetary expenditure and 100% of them concluded in cost-effectiveness of critical care clinical pharmacy services.</p><p id="Par749"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> ICU clinical pharmacists do not only intercept medication prescription errors once they happen and decrease related hypothetic institutional costs. Their full time presence and interdisciplinary team inclusion in the ICU globally improves patient care and translates into tangible benefits in terms of patient outcomes and direct monetary savings. We can no longer ignore international recommendations warranting full time specialized clinical pharmacy services in critical care units to ensure patient care efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. Critical care clinical pharmacy services should be considered as an essential element of a standard ICU.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec583"><title>F-67 Impact of implementing a computer-based prescription system and moving in new buildings on healthcare workload&#x02014;the case for acute respiratory failure (ARF) and sepsis</title><sec id="Sec584"><title>Dachraoui Fahmi<sup>1</sup>, Tlili Mariem<sup>1</sup>, Bouker Nouha<sup>1</sup>, Hraiech Kmar<sup>1</sup>, Nouira Wiem<sup>1</sup>, Ouni Amal<sup>1</sup>, Zorgati Hend<sup>1</sup>, Boukadida Sana<sup>1</sup>, Hammouda Zaineb<sup>1</sup>, Ouanes Islem<sup>1</sup>, Ouanes Besbes Lamia<sup>1</sup>, Abroug Fekri<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec585"><title><sup>1</sup>Chu Fatouma Bourguiba, Monastir, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec586"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Dachraoui Fahmi - dachraoui.fahmi@gmail.com</title><p id="Par750"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-67</p><p id="Par751"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Workload affects the quality of care and the prognosis of critically ills patients. Measuring workload in intensive care units (ICU) has thus become essential for allowing a better matching between the activities required and the management of resources.

Bland&#x02013;Altman analysis showed excellent accuracy and precision between recorded and collected data for all tested variables within clinically significant pre-defined limits of agreement. However, 82 (2.5%) data were missing and a delay was observed between videotaped and collected times. This delay was less than 28&#x000a0;s and remained stable through all data for each patient. We identified that the missing data were due to a limit in the number of data being processed in the database at the same time and the delay between data presentation and data collection in the database was due to different server time settings. Both technical issues were corrected.</p><p id="Par759"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study identified two issues in the data collection process that slightly limited the accuracy of our high resolution electronic database. We recommend the performance of such validation study before using a high resolution database for clinical or research purposes.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec591"><title>F-69 Association between bodyweight variation and survival and other adverse events in critically ill patients with shock: a multicenter cohort study of the OUTCOMEREA network</title><sec id="Sec592"><title>Dupuis Claire<sup>1</sup>, Gros Antoine<sup>1</sup>, Ruckly St&#x000e9;phane<sup>1</sup>, Lautrette Alexandre<sup>1</sup>, Garrouste-Orgeas Mait&#x000e9;<sup>1</sup>, Gainnier Marc<sup>1</sup>, Forel Jean-Marie<sup>1</sup>, Marcotte Guillaume<sup>1</sup>, Azoulay Elie<sup>1</sup>, Cohen Yves<sup>1</sup>, Schwebel Carole<sup>1</sup>, Argaud Laurent<sup>1</sup>, De Montmollin Etienne<sup>1</sup>, Siami Shidasp<sup>1</sup>, Goldgran-Toledano Dany<sup>1</sup>, Darmon Michael<sup>1</sup>, Timsit Jean-Fran&#x000e7;ois<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec593"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Andr&#x000e9; Mignot, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec594"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Dupuis Claire - cdup83@gmail.com</title><p id="Par760"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-69</p><p id="Par761"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Fluid overload, and also its variations, is known to jeopardize the outcome of ICU patients.

Fine and Gray sub-distribution survival models were used, with ICU discharge as competing event, adjusted on comorbidity and illness severity at admission at each landmark, from Day 3 to Day 7. The impact of BWV on ICU stay duration was estimated through a multivariate negative binomial regression model.</p><p id="Par763"><bold>Results:</bold> The median age and SAPS 2 score of the 2 374 included patients were 67 (IQR, 55&#x02013;77) years and 53 (IQR, 41&#x02013;65), respectively. The BWV increased from 0.4&#x000a0;kg (IQR, 0&#x02013;4.8) on Day 3 to 3&#x000a0;kg (IQR, &#x02212;&#x000a0;0.4 to 8.2) on Day 7. The 30&#x000a0;day in-hospital mortality, the ICU occurrence of bedsore and VAP were 27, 3 and 19.6%, respectively. Four categories of BWV were defined according to BWV interquartiles: weight loss, stable weight, moderate and severe weight gain. Categories of BWV were independently associated with death on Day 5 and Day 6 (Day 5 : sHR 1.27; 95% 0.99&#x02013;1.63 p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.06; Day 6: sHR 1.43; 95% CI 1.08&#x02013;1.89, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig26" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). A weight loss tended to be associated with increased occurrence of bedsore, and weight gain with increased occurrence of VAP.

The minimisation of ICU acquired PU remain an international challenge. This paper describes Australian research that used multi-layer soft silicone sacral and heel dressings to prevent PU in critically ill patients.</p><p id="Par768"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A total of 440 critically ill patients were enrolled into an 18-month randomised controlled trial in one of Melbourne&#x02019;s trauma centres. Patients were randomised on admission to the Emergency Department and either had standard PU prevention or standard care plus the application of prophylactic sacral and heel dressings. Patients were observed daily for PU development for the duration of their ICU stay.</p><p id="Par769"><bold>Results:</bold> Patients in the dressing group has significantly reduced incidence rate of PU development compared to patients receiving standard PU prevention alone (3.1 vs 13.1%, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.03). Patients in the dressings group had a relative risk reduction of 80% and a 10% absolute risk reduction for developing a PU regardless of their critical illness. Results indicate the number needed to treat to prevent one PU was 10. Additionally, we calculated the cost&#x02013;benefit of this intervention and found the patients treated with prophylactic dressings cost 3.6 time less than the standard care group for wound care.</p><p id="Par770"><bold>Discussion:</bold> The use of prophylactic dressings to prevent PU at our hospital have proved to be very effective in ICU and subsequent studies have confirmed our results. It appears that the main mechanism of PU protection provided by these dressings is the reduction of pressure and shear forces leading to tissue distortion and cell death rather than the previously accepted ischaemic model of PU development. Our current policy is now to use these dressings on all patients with a high risk of developing PU.</p><p id="Par771"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of prophylactic multi-layer silicone dressings to prevent PU in critically ill patients is effective but it does not replace standard PU prevention methods. The use of these dressings sould be considered complimentary to best practice in PU prevention.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec599"><title>F-71 Iatrogenic events in intensive care unit: incidence, risk factors and impact on outcome</title><sec id="Sec600"><title>Ayed Samia<sup>1</sup>, Merhebene Takoua<sup>1</sup>, Jamoussi Amira<sup>1</sup>, Ben Khelil Jalila<sup>1</sup>, Besbes Mohamed<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec601"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Memmi, Ariana, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec602"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Ayed Samia - samia.ayed@yahoo.fr</title><p id="Par772"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-71</p><p id="Par773"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Iatrogenic events (IEs) are defined as harm resulting from medical intervention and health care, and not explained by underlying disease.

However hyperlactatemia and lactate kinetics may result from both increased production and impaired clearance in the critically ill, and may therefore not only rely on the severity of circulatory failure. We herein addressed the determinants of hyperlactatemia (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;mmol/L) and the factors likely to impact on early lactate clearance in septic shock.</p><p id="Par779"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This was a 9-year (2008&#x02013;2016) monocentric retrospective study. All adult patients diagnosed for septic shock within the first 48&#x000a0;h were included. Septic shock was defined as a microbiologically proven or clinically suspected infection, associated with acute circulatory failure requiring vasopressors. The first lactate value (L1) was measured at the time of ICU admission. Hyperlactatemia was defined as a first lactate level&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;mmol/L. The second value (L2) was measured within 12&#x000a0;h following the first measurement. Lactate clearance was calculated as (L1-L2) L1 time between L1 and L2 measurements) and expressed in mmol hour.

Patients with initial hyperlactatemia had a higher in-ICU mortality rate (41.3% versus 32.6%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.007). In multivariate analysis, hyperlactatemia was independently associated with bacteremia (OR 1.64, CI 95% [1.19&#x02013;2.27], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002) and prior beta-2 adrenergic agonist therapy (OR 0.32, CI 95% [0.15&#x02013;0.67], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003). In multivariate analysis adjusted with severity, early lactate clearance (i.e. decrease in lactate levels within the first 12&#x000a0;h) was independently associated with the following variables&#x02014;leucopenia at admission (OR 0.53, CI 95% [0.32&#x02013;0.89], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.016), initial lactate value (OR 1.28, CI 95% [1.20&#x02013;1.36], p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), arterial oxygen content (OR 1.05, CI 95% [1.01&#x02013;1.10], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009), concurrent fluid balance (per liter) (OR 0.91, CI 95% [0.85&#x02013;0.97], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.005).</p><p id="Par781"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Optimisation of the arterial oxygen content to improve tissue oxygenation represents a major therapeutic goal in septic shock.

CPB induces a significant increase in circulating neutrophils. Neutrophil activation, associated with production of antibacterial peptides, reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines, and other inflammatory mediators, as well as release of DNA into the extracellular milieu (Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)), plays a central role in innate host defense and modulation of inflammation. However, it has been shown that, in septic shock or systemic inflammation as major surgery, immature circulating neutrophils can induce immunosuppression and increase the risk of secondary infections. Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is one of the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogen responsible for poststernotomy mediastinitis, and neutrophils alterations may favor postoperative infections. The main objectives of this study were to evaluate the direct effects of CBP on neutrophils functions and to study the impact of different strains of SA on neutrophils bactericidal functions.</p><p id="Par784"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Blood samples were collected before and 24&#x000a0;h after cardiac surgery with CPB and bone marrow samples were harvested directly after sternotomy, before initiation of CPB, and at the end of CPB, before sternal closure. Septic patients were included as controls. Circulating neutrophils analysis was performed using flow cytometry. We also studied NETosis, ROS production and bactericidal activity in isolated neutrophils before and after surgery using two strains of SA&#x02014;one responsible of postoperative mediastinitis and one isolated from nasal carriage.</p><p id="Par785"><bold>Results:</bold> Blood cell count with differential demonstrated a significant increase in neutrophils 24&#x000a0;h after surgery. Flow cytometry analysis of blood samples indicated neutrophils were matures with a significant increase in degranulation marker (CD66b). Neutrophils life span was also increased after CBP. Flow cytometry analysis of bone marrow samples showed no difference in cell composition and maturation before and after CBP. The neutrophil production of ROS was significantly higher after CBP. However, CBP did not impact NETs formation, phagocytosis and bactericidial function. Moreover, there was no difference regarding the phagocytosis and the bactericidial activity when exposed to the two strain of SA. As expected, immature neutrophils count was significantly increased in septic patients compared to cardiac surgery patients.</p><p id="Par786"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These results indicate that CBP promotes the recruitment of matures neutrophils via a demargination process. CBP does not induce neutrophil dysfunction. Neutrophils should not be targeted to decrease postoperative infection after CPB.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec611"><title>F-74 A study of the correlation between Protein Tyrosin Phosphatase-1B gene expression and organ failure during septic shock</title><sec id="Sec612"><title>Beuzelin Marion<sup>1</sup>, Grang&#x000e9; Steven<sup>1</sup>, Clavier Thomas<sup>1</sup>, Girault Christophe<sup>1</sup>, Beduneau Ga&#x000eb;tan<sup>1</sup>, Carpentier Doroth&#x000e9;e<sup>1</sup>, Artaud-Macari Elise<sup>1</sup>, Hobeika Sinad<sup>1</sup>, Lemaitre Caroline<sup>1</sup>, Enguerrand Pauline<sup>1</sup>, Tamion Fabienne<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec613"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU Charles Nicolle, Rouen, France</title><sec id="Sec614"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Beuzelin Marion - marion.beuzelin@gmail.com</title><p id="Par787"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-74</p><p id="Par788"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of both NO production and insulin signaling and has been shown to be an aggravating factor in septic shock.

The pharmacological inhibition of TREM-1 confers protection in several pre-clinical models of acute inflammation. In this study, we aimed to decipher the role of TREM-1 on the endothelium.</p><p id="Par799"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We evaluated the expression of Trem-1 in vessels and isolated endothelial cells by flow cytometry, qRT-PCR and confocal microscopy. We generated an endothelium-conditional Trem-1 ko mice and submitted them to polymicrobial sepsis through CLP. Organs and blood were harvested at different time points and analyzed for cellular content, cytokine chemokine concentrations, and vasoreactivity. Survival was monitored for 1&#x000a0;week.</p><p id="Par800"><bold>Results:</bold> Trem-1 was expressed in aorta and pulmonary vessels from animals, and inducible after LPS stimulation or during sepsis. These results were confirmed in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells. The pharmacological inhibition of TREM-1, using the synthetic inhibitory peptide LR12, decreased the LPS-induced Trem-1 expression. Sepsis induced a profound vascular hyporeactivity in WT animals, both in terms of contractility and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Although contractility was still impaired in EndoTREM-1&#x02014;mice, vasorelaxation was completely restored. Soluble TREM-1 concentrations, a marker of TREM-1 activation, were markedly increased in the plasma, the peritoneal lavage fluid and the lungs from WT septic mice compared to control. In EndoTREM-1&#x02014;mice, sTREM-1 level was reduced. Plasma concentrations of soluble VCAM-1 and IL-6 were also reduced in EndoTREM-1&#x02014;animals. We observed an accumulation of neutrophils and inflammatory Ly6Chigh monocytes in the lung of WT septic mice. This accumulation was dampened in EndoTrem-1&#x02014;mice. By contrast, endothelial Trem-1 deletion favored the accumulation of reparative cells (Ly6Clow monocytes). Finally, survival was clearly improved in the EndoTrem-1&#x02014;group as compared to the WT group.</p><p id="Par801"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We reported that TREM-1 is expressed and inducible in endothelial cells and plays a direct role in vascular inflammation and dysfunction. The targeted deletion of endothelial Trem-1 conferred protection during septic shock in modulating inflammatory cells mobilization and activation, restoring vasoreactivity and improving survival.

Two groups of eight animals were randomised to receive a continous perfusion (5&#x000a0;mL/kg/h) of sodium lactate 11.2% (treatment group) or 0.9% NaCl (control group). In order to inject the same caloric load in the two groups, a 4.35&#x000a0;mL/kg/h of either water of 10% dextrose solution were perfused.

Intermittent RR measurement via visual observation is routine and it is usually estimated by visual counts of the chest wall movements. This approach has several inherent limitations that diminish its clinical applicability. The pulse oximetry photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal monitoring is routine since the early 1980&#x02019;. The PPG signal includes respiratory synchronous components, seen as frequency modulation of the heart rate, amplitude modulation of the cardiac pulse, and respiratory induced intensity variations in the PPG baseline. Several studies have attempted to extract RR from PPG recordings, however their majority have been undertaken in controlled settings, on small groups of healthy subjects, and or have included waveforms without artefacts. The main purpose of our study is to assess the validity of a new RR extraction algorithm.</p><p id="Par815"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This study is derived from a datawharehousing project (ReaSTOC study, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier&#x02014;NCT02893462), including all consecutive patients admitted to our ICU. Physiological tracings were recorded from the standard monitoring system (Intelliview MP70 Philips), using a dedicated network and extraction software (Synapse v1, LTSI INSERM U1099) that enables photoplethysmographic recordings at a native resolution of 125&#x000a0;Hz. All consecutive patients were recorded for a 2-hours period during the first 24-hours following admission. Physiological recordings were associated with metadata collection. The proposed method for RR estimation relies on analyzing frequency components of a PPG signal via its spectrum, and enhancing respiration-induced modulations by advanced statistical signal processing techniques.</p><p id="Par816"><bold>Results:</bold> 202 patients were analyzed (140 male&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;age 60&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;11&#x000a0;yr., SAPSII 51.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;15.7). 26.2% had a history of chronic respiratory disorder&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;They were admitted for acute respiratory failure (41.6%), hemodynamic failure (28.2%), neurological failure (18.3%). 128 patients were under invasive mechanical ventilation (63.4%) and 72 patients were spontaneously breathing (35.6%).

Relying on self-report, its measurement remains challenging in patients unable to communicate. A 5-item observation scale, namely the intensive care&#x02014;respiratory distress observation scale (IC-RDOS), has been proposed as a surrogate of dyspnea-visual analogic scale (D-VAS) self-report in intensive care unit (ICU) patients [1]. However this scale has been validated among non-intubated patients and included one item &#x0201c;supplemental oxygen&#x0201d; not thoroughly adapted for intubated population. We sought to develop a dyspnea observation scale more suitable for intubated patients and to evaluate its performance to detect dyspnea.</p><p id="Par840"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Ancillary analysis of data prospectively collected from 220 ICU communicative patients enrolled for the validation of the IC-RDOS. Factorial principal component analysis was first performed to select variables that mostly contributed to the principal axes, among a set of 21 observable variables with possible clinical relevance. To identify the best correlation between these variables and D-VAS, were performed an iterative partial least square regression process (PLS).</p><p id="Par841"><bold>Results:</bold> Iterative PLS procedure identified five variables, of which the combination and weighting allowed optimal correlation with D-VAS (r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.61;&#x000a0;95% CI 0.50 to 0.72;&#x000a0;<italic>p</italic> value&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), which constitute the IC-RDOS [1].

Early diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) remains a challenge to the intensivist. However, scientific evidence is little available on whether LUS reliably improves the diagnosis of VAP. The aim of this prospective study was to assess whether LUS could be an alternative to pulmonary computerized Tomography (CT) for assessing diagnosis of VAP in ICM.</p><p id="Par847"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Twenty-one patients ventilated for duration more than 5&#x000a0;days suspected of VAP were included. LUS was performed by a well-trained operator who was blinded of the VAP diagnosis. The diagnostic gold standard of VAP was on the basis of pulmonary CT and positive culture pulmonary. All clinical criteria for the diagnosis were collected the same day of LUS and pulmonary CT. The ultrasound exam included anterior, lateral and posterior views from both sides of the chest with superior and inferior views. We classed patient in 4 groups according diagnosis of VAP with pulmonary CT (VAP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;or VAP-) and LUS (LUS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;or LUS-). LUS characteristics of VAP diagnosis included 9 profils&#x02014;asymetric line B (profil A B), without sliding (profil B&#x02019;), sub pleural consolidation (profil C), consolidation with punctiforme bronchogram (PB), linear air bronchograms (LB) or dynamic bronchograms (LBD), posteror lateral alveolar pleural suffusion (PLAPS), pleural effusion pathological (PEP), shred sign (SS).</p><p id="Par848"><bold>Results:</bold> Of 21 patients prospectively included, 17 (81%) were diagnosed VAP&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;.

The positive rates for LUS&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;of the profil A B, profil B&#x02019;, profil C, PB, LB, LBD, PLAPS, PEP and SS were respectively 34, 23, 14, 34, 25, 32, 21, 9, 45%. The overall accuracy, sensitivity and negative predictive value of LUS for VAP diagnosis were 85.8, 95.7 and 80.4% respectively. Specificity and positive predictive value of LUS for VAP diagnosis were 82 and 95.3% respectively. The area-under-the-ROC curve of the LUS for VAP diagnosis was 0.89 (95% IC 0.76&#x02013;0.92), p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0055.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figan_HTML" id="MO27010011100"/></p><p id="Par849"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> LUS is a sensitive diagnostic tool with which to identify VAP in critical ill patient.

Investigating center was the sole factor significantly associated with the choice of insertion site in multivariate analysis (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). Higher weight did not affect choice of insertion site. Mean duration of catheter use was 6.6 (+-5.0) days without difference according to site. Catheter dysfunction was the main reason for replacement (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;61, 49%). Suspicion of infection led to replacement of many catheters (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40, 32%) but was actually seldom proven (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4, 3%).

However, little is known about the effect of SLED on antibiotics clearance. Despite recent new antibiotics, vancomycin remains an important drug used to treat cocci-gram positive severe infections in ICU. Many studies have reported data regarding clearance of vancomycin during continuous and or intermittent RRT. However, only few data are available regarding vancomycin pharmacokinetic (PK) on SLED. Here, we realised a meta-analysis of vancomycin clearance during continuous and intermittent RRT to model vancomycin PK during SLED.</p><p id="Par862"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a systematic review of published article on PK of vancomycin during RRT with high flux filters. The literature search was conducted from the PubMed database from its inception to August 2017. Studies were included if they were providing an estimation of RRT vancomycin clearance. A model based meta-analysis of RRT vancomycin clearance in function of RRT settings (blood, dialysate and ultrafiltration flow rate) was performed using a non-linear mixed effect model. To guide the choice of the dosing regiment, we used previously published population PK data to simulate the PK of vancomycin in ICU patient undergoing SLED.

Based on population PK simulations, following a 1.75&#x000a0;g vancomycin bolus (25&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg for a 70&#x000a0;kg patient), time to pass below a threshold of 15&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g&#x000a0;l was estimated to 5.87&#x000a0;h [2.83&#x02013;12.7] (mean, 90%CI) for patient undergoing SLED (started 1&#x000a0;h after first administration) and to 19.21 h [4.37&#x02013;120&#x000a0;+] for whose who not.

Dialysis alter hemodynamics mainly by short term variation of blood volume. In this study we took advantage of a continuous monitoring of blood volume during dialysis session to decipher the relationship between the variation of relative blood volume (RBV) with mean arterial pressure (MAP).</p><p id="Par867"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This study is observational prospective, including all prolonged (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;h) dialysis sessions in Saint Etienne nephrology intensive care unit between January and June 2017. Exclusion criteria were ongoing blood transfusion and blood volume controled ultrafiltration. Medical records were compiled along with cardiac ultrasonography at the beginning when available. The statistical analysis was perfomed in two parts. The first part studied the performances of the first hour deltaRBV (defined by RBV before minus RBV after 1&#x000a0;h of dialysis) to predict a drop of MAP below 65&#x000a0;mmHg (hypotension). This analysis excluded sessions with hypotension and intervention during the first hour.

Several retrospectives studies reported the short-term outcome of KTR admitted to the ICU, but data concerning the risk of chronic kidney disease and anti-HLA immunization are scarce.</p><p id="Par872"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> In this retrospective study, we addressed the in-hospital and long-term mortalities of the 200 KTR admitted in a French ICU (10 beds) between January 2010 and June 2016. Predictive factors for death, long-term renal function and HLA immunization were identified.</p><p id="Par873"><bold>Results:</bold> The main causes for admission were acute respiratory failure (27.5%), sepsis (26.5%), post-operative period (peritonitis, hemorrhage&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;23%). At the admission, mean age, SAPS2 and SOFA score were 58&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13&#x000a0;years, 52&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;19 and 6.7&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.3, respectively. Renal replacement therapy, mechanical ventilation and vasopressors were required in 103 (51.5%), 107 (53.5%) and 97 (48.5%) patients. Immunosuppressive regimen was modified in 155 patients (76.1%&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;steroids increase 68%, calcineurin inhibitors or antimetabolites withdrawal 25 and 37%, respectively). In-hospital mortality was 20% (30.1 and 38.2% at months 12 and 36). By multivariate analysis, EBV blood proliferation in the 6&#x000a0;months preceding the admission in the ICU, and the SAPS2 gravity score at admission independently predicted the in-hospital and long-term mortalities. Among the 113 patients alive at month 6 after the admission in the ICU and with available data, 34 (30.1%) and 51 (45.1%) progressed to a more severe CKD stage at months 1 and 6, respectively. Both, the severity of the AKI and the preexisting CKD predicted the risk of progression of the CKD. Last, de novo anti-HLA immunization at month 6 was identified in 18 119 patients (15.1%, donor specific antibodies 11 18 (61.1%)) and was significantly associated with the occurrence of acute transplant rejection (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002).

AKI was defined according to the &#x0201c;Kidney Disease&#x02014;Improving Global Outcomes&#x0201d; definition. We used multivariate analysis to assess whether or not the presence of AKI independently influenced the risk for 30-day death.</p><p id="Par879"><bold>Results:</bold> The study included 21,131 patients with acute PE, of whom 6222 (29.5%) had AKI at baseline. Of these, 4385 patients (21%) were in stage 1, 1385 (6.5%) in stage 2 and 452 (2%) in stage 3. The proportion of patients with high-risk PE in those with no AKI, AKI stage 1, AKI stage 2 and AKI stage 3 was&#x02014;2.8, 5.3, 8.8 and 12%, respectively (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

Moreover AKI was an independent predictor of poor outcome in PE patients. This study suggests that PE (and its severity) should be considered as a risk factor for AKI and AKI may deserve to be evaluated as a prognostic factor in patients with acute PE.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec683"><title>F-92 Severe metabolic acidosis after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: risk factors and relationship with outcome</title><sec id="Sec684"><title>Jamme Matthieu<sup>1</sup>, Ben Hadj Salem Omar<sup>1</sup>, Guillemet Lucie<sup>1</sup>, Dupland Pierre<sup>1</sup>, Bougouin Wulfran<sup>1</sup>, Charpentier Julien<sup>1</sup>, Mira Jean-Paul<sup>1</sup>, P&#x000e8;ne Fr&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ric<sup>1</sup>, Dumas Florence<sup>1</sup>, Cariou Alain<sup>1</sup>, G&#x000e9;ri Guillaume<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec685"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Cochin (APHP), Paris, France; <sup>2</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Ambroise Par&#x000e9; (APHP), Boulogne Billancourt, France</title><sec id="Sec686"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Jamme Matthieu - mathieu.jamme@aphp.fr</title><p id="Par881"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>F-92</p><p id="Par882"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Metabolic acidosis is frequently observed as a consequence of global ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Similar findings have been reported from Anglo-Saxon countries in the setting of intensive care. Due to the different structure of the healthcare system in France, we aimed to investigate whether socio-economic status influences initial severity of disease and 3&#x000a0;months mortality in patients admitted to intensive care in France.</p><p id="Par888"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective, multicentre, cohort study including 1396 adult patients admitted to one of 8 participating intensive care units (ICUs) between 2012 and 2016, and presenting failure of one or more major organs.

Compared to non-vulnerable patients, socially vulnerable patients were younger (64.8 vs 67.2&#x000a0;years, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.006), more frequently had chronic disease (18.0 vs 12.0%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003 respectively for congestive heart failure&#x000a0;and 26.8%vs 18.1%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0002 for chronic respiratory disease), had higher levels of physical dependency (9.2 vs 4.7%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002), and were more often classed as having long-term health conditions (67.1 vs 62.1%, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Conversely, non-vulnerable patients had greater severity of disease at admission to the ICU than those classed as vulnerable, both in terms of SAPS II and SOFA scores (respectively 53.16 vs 50.09 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001) and 8.35 vs 7.77(p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002)).

A decision of LST limitation was reported in 948 patients (23.4%). In univariate analysis, patients with LST limitation decision were older and more frequently hospitalized for a medical condition, had a lower body weight, a higher SOFA score, and presented active neoplasia immunosuppression or chronic liver failure more frequently (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001 for all). Patients admitted after trauma, drug overdose or pulmonary contusion were less subject to have an LST limitation decision (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001). In contrast, patients with non-cardiogenic shock were more subject to these decisions (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.018).

Among 948 patients with an LST limitation decision, 148 survived (15.6%). Mortality was higher in this group than in the whole study population (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). In univariate analysis, death after decision of LST limitation was associated with admission for a medical condition (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02), severe ARDS, higher inspiratory pressure, non-cardiogenic shock, higher SOFA score with or without respiratory component and chronic liver failure (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001 for all). On the contrary, admission for trauma was associated with survival (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.001). Regarding the 1503 patients who died during their hospital stay, 703 did not receive a decision of LST limitation (46.8%).

A decision not to re-admit a patient to the ICU could be seen as a limitation of therapy, thus falling within the scope of the law dated 22 April 2005, by denying the patient access to potentially-available healthcare resources. In this context, we aimed to&#x02014;(1) investigate whether decisions not to re-admit patients to the ICU are taken in accordance with French legislation&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;and (2) identify the characteristics of patients concerned by this type of decision.</p><p id="Par903"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This study was based on data from the prospective, multicentre IVOIRE cohort (Influence of socio-economic vulnerability on initial severity and prognosis of patients admitted to the ICU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;PHRC-IR 2012).

The study was evaluating 2 different PEEP strategies. Notably, PEEP and other settings was kept constant during the last 14&#x000a0;h of the 16&#x000a0;h PP session. EIT was performed with Swisstom BB2 device. Patients were assessed in SP at 30&#x000b0; and in PP at 0&#x000b0;or 15&#x000b0; from the horizontal plane. EIT belt was placed around the chest according to manufacturer&#x02019;s specifications. To prevent pressure sores in the PP dressing was placed between EIT belt and mattress and around the EIT wire. We analyzed the the center of ventilation (CoV), which describes the well-ventilated areas of the lung with 0% for ventilation occurring only in the ventral region and 100% for a ventilation only in the dorsal region. We report the time course of CoV in supine position (SP) 30&#x000a0;min before PP, 30&#x000a0;min after the beginning of PP (H0.5) and every hour (H1, H2&#x02026; H16) till PP end.

With PP, CoV did not vary significantly (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.53) between SP and H0.5. However, some patients experienced clinically significant drop or rise of CoV (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig34" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

Transpulmonary driving pressure (DPtp) was 13 [11&#x02013;16.5]&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O and was highly correlated to DP (R2&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.97, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), whereas lung (EL) and chest wall elastance (ECW) were 25[20&#x02013;34] and 9.4[7.0&#x02013;11.0]&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O litre, respectively. Patients with PLrel below 20cmH20 had higher ECW and lower DPtp. PEEP volume was significantly lower in the group with PLrel below 20cmH20 with 360[272&#x02013;571] vs 621[438&#x02013;856] ml, respectively, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04.

We performed an incremental PEEP trial (5&#x000a0;cm H2O steps) with TPP measurement (NutriVent probe, Sidam, Italy) in a semi-recumbent position as previously described. A decremental PEEP trial after a recruitment maneuver was not performed since the safety of such a maneuver in this specific population is largely unknown. We defined two ways for determination of external PEEP setting&#x02014;(1) PEEP necessary to obtain a positive expiratory TPP and (2) PEEP necessary to obtain a plateau pressure between 28 and 30&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O (maximal alveolar recruitment Express strategy).

The Express strategy indicated a PEEP setting of 15&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O (IR 15&#x02013;20) whereas TPP-guided PEEP was 30&#x000a0;cm H<sub>2</sub>O (IR 25&#x02013;32), p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03.

It was recently demonstrated that vasopressor dependency and refractory shock could be predicted by a MAP-phenylephrine dose&#x02013;response curve.

Prevalence decreased both for CS on admission (from 2.7% in 2000 to 1.1% in 2015) and CS developing at a later stage (from 4.4 to 1.7%). In CS patients, baseline demographic characteristics did not change markedly over time (mean age 74&#x000a0;years in 1995, 72&#x000a0;years in 2015&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;female sex 44% in 1995, 28% in 2015, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.11). Diabetes mellitus remained unchanged while hypertension increased from 52 to 66% and hypercholesterolemia from 24 to 42%. History of AMI (28 to 15%), stroke (13 to 4%) and heart failure (20 to 6%) decreased over time. In contrast, cardiac arrest increased from 9% in 2005 to 16% in 2015. In parallel, invasive ventilation increased from 16 to 40% and circulatory assist devices from 0.4 to 9%. Use of PCI increased from 20% in 1995 to 74% in 2015, while Coronary Artery Bypass Graft Surgery during the initial hospital stay increased from 2 to 4.8%. Six-month mortality was 73% in 1995, decreased to 62% in 2005 and remained as high as 58% in 2015. At each time point, mortality was lower in patients who underwent PCI&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;trends in 6-month mortality showed little difference from 1995 to 2015 in patients without PCI (76 to 74%), and only a slight decrease in those undergoing PCI (60 to 53%).

However, their incidence has decreased thanks to the development of an antifungal prophylaxis in the post-transplantation period. In patients at high risk of invasive fungal infection (IFI), this strategy is recommended, whereas its benefit remains controversial in low-risk patients. However, there is no clear definition of these two patients groups.

Ensuring a reliable and safe drug dosing in critically ill patients can be difficult, due to variable and dynamic organ function. Indeed, overexposure to piperacillin and amoxicillin can lead to neurological disorders. Pharmacological therapeutic monitoring (PTM) of beta-lactams ensures the efficacy and safety of the treatment by measuring the residual serum concentration. There are currently no clear guidelines on a threshold for toxic concentrations for all beta-lactams and therapeutic drug monitoring in critically ill patients may be a useful intervention to avoid antibiotic-related toxicities. The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic concentration values of the beta-lactam antibiotics as well as threshold values associated with toxicity.</p><p id="Par1015"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This study was carried out retrospectively during the period 01.01.2015 to 08.02.2017, in patients hospitalized in the medical ICU-CHU Rouen with PTM. The dosages of piperacillin and amoxicillin were performed in the Department of Pharmcology and Toxicology using a high performance liquid chromatography technique coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC MS).</p><p id="Par1016"><bold>Results:</bold> The number of beta-lactam antibiotics was 119. Of these 119 requests, half were for piperacillin (49.6%), and one-third were for amoxicillin (30.3%). The other dosages were mainly for cloxacillin, cefepime, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone.

Patients with a GNB-BSI were included and were divided into two groups according to the resistance (R) profile (BSI due to a R isolate or not). The following resistances were considered&#x02014;all GNB-BSI including Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas spp. and Enterobacteriacae (Eb) for which the following antimicrobial resistances were considered&#x02014;ticarcillin and ceftazidime (cefta) (Pseudomonas (PA)), third generation cephalosporin (3GC) (Eb) and imipenem (all GNB).

Drainage of the pleural space by a chest tube is a common intervention in such situations. Blunt dissection technique with a Kelly clamp is preferred to classical trocar techniques to prevent severe complications, like perforation of thoracic or abdominal organs. Despite these precautions, malposition remains the most common complication of tube thoracostomy. We investigated a new technique of bougie-assisted chest tube insertion to prevent chest tube malposition after chest drainage of post traumatic pleural effusion.</p><p id="Par1072"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We performed a controlled before-and-after study to assess the ability of a bougie-assisted chest tube insertion technique, compared to a standard blunt dissection technique, to prevent chest tube malposition. For the bougie-assisted group, we used a disposable Eschmann-style bougie, commonly used to guide the endotracheal tube during difficult intubations. Technique consisted in blunt dissection until the parietal pleura is opened. Thoracostomy tube was preloaded onto the bougie and bougie was advanced alongside the finger, with apical or caudal direction after entering the chest cavity, depending on the type of pleural effusion. Thoracostomy tube was then advanced forward utilizing a Seldinger technique. The primary end point was optimal position of the chest tube. The tube position was blindly assessed on standard chest X-ray. In pneumothorax, optimal position was apical (above the aortic arch), and in hemothorax or mixed-effusion it was basal (2&#x000a0;cm above the diaphragm or lower).</p><p id="Par1073"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 58 patients were enrolled (bougie-assisted&#x02014;n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;30&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;conventional&#x02014;n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;28).

While adequate delivery of oxygen to tissue is crucial, hyperoxemia may be deleterious. Invasive out-of-hospital ventilation is often promptly performed in life-threatening emergencies. We propose to determine whether the arterial oxygen pressure (PaO2) at intensive care unit (ICU) admission affects mortality at day 28 (D28) in patients with septic shock subjected to mechanical out-of-hospital ventilation.</p><p id="Par1097"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We performed a monocentric retrospective observational study on 77 patients with septic shock admitted to the ICU. PaO2 was measured at ICU admission in patients subjected to invasive ventilation before any hospital admission. The primary outcome was mortality at day 28 (D28).</p><p id="Par1098"><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-nine (64%) patients with septic shock were mechanically ventilated before any hospital admission and transferred to the ICU. The mean PaO2 at ICU admission was 153&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;77 and 202&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;82&#x000a0;mmHg for alive and deceased patients at D28, respectively. PaO2 was significantly associated with mortality at D28 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04). Using a ROC curve, the corresponding AUC was 0.70 [0.54&#x02013;0.85]. For a PaO2&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;150&#x000a0;mmHg, the OR for mortality at D28 was 4.20 [1.25&#x02013;15.95] (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02), whereas for a PaO2&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;150&#x000a0;mmHg, the OR was 0.24 [0.06&#x02013;0.80] (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02).</p><p id="Par1099"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In this study, we report a significant association between hyperoxemia at ICU admission and mortality at D28 in patients with septic shock subjected to pre-hospital invasive mechanical ventilation. The adjustment of the PaO2 is a crucial prognosis factor in patients with septic shock subjected to invasive out-of-hospital ventilation to avoid the toxic effects of hyperoxemia. However, blood gazometry is hard to get in a prehospital setting. Consequently, alternative and feasible measures are needed, such as pulse oximetry, to improve the management of prehospital invasive ventilation.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec856"><title>P-15 Benefits of control CT-scan 24&#x000a0;h after thrombolysis in acute pulmonary embolism</title><sec id="Sec857"><title>Jamoussi Amira<sup>1</sup>, Jarraya Fatma<sup>1</sup>, Ayed Samia<sup>1</sup>, Merhebene Takoua<sup>1</sup>, Hantous Saoussen<sup>1</sup>, Ben Khelil Jalila<sup>1</sup>, Besbes Mohamed<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec858"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Abderrahmen Mami, Ariana, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec859"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Jamoussi Amira - dr.amira.jamoussi@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1100"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-15</p><p id="Par1101"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Nowadays, benefit of enhanced CT-scan in positive diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is well established.

We previously showed that diazepam (DZP) BUP combination induces severe respiratory depression in the rat, while each drug by itself does not. The objective of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in this drug&#x02013;drug interaction using 11C-BUP PET imaging and diaphragmatic electromyography in the Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rat.</p><p id="Par1133"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> 11C-BUP was administered intravenously, 30&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg unlabeled BUP intraperitoneally and 20&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg DZP subcutaneously. PET acquisition started with 11C-BUP PET injection, 15&#x000a0;min after DZP or its vehicle (VEH&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5 group) administration. SUV normalized time activity curves (TACs) were generated and 11C-BUP binding potential [BPND, i.e. the ratio of the total receptor density (Bmax) on the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD)] were modeled in different brain regions using a simplified reference tissue model with cerebellum as reference region. dEM, implanted under anesthesia 7&#x000a0;days before the experiment, was recorded during 240&#x000a0;min in rats receiving VEH VEH, DZP VEH, VEH BUP or DZP BUP (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6 group). After filtering and half-wave rectification, the first 60&#x000a0;min AUC of diaphragm contraction and workload were determined and compared between the groups.</p><p id="Par1134"><bold>Results:</bold> TACs and 11C-BUP BPND were not different between the DZP BUP and the VEH BUP groups in all studied brain regions. Diaphragm contraction was significantly increased in the VEH BUP group in comparison to the DZP BUP group (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).

BUP administration induced an increase in diaphragm contraction and workload. This increase was inhibited in the presence of DZP suggesting that DZP BUP combination-induced respiratory depression is mostly related to DZP.</p><p id="Par1136"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Respiratory depression related to DZP BUP combination results from a pharmacodynamic drug&#x02013;drug interaction.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec884"><title>P-22 Is naloxone the best antidote to reverse tramadol-induced neuro-respiratory toxicity in overdose?

Tramadol overdose results not only in central nervous system (CNS) depression attributed to its opioid properties but also in seizures, possibly related to non-opioidergic pathways, thus questioning the efficiency of naloxone to reverse tramadol-induced CNS toxicity. Our objective was to investigate the most efficient antidote to reverse tramadol-induced seizures and respiratory depression in overdose.</p><p id="Par1139"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats overdosed with 75&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg intraperitoneal (IP) tramadol were randomized into four groups to receive solvent (control group), diazepam (1.77&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg IP), naloxone (2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg intravenous bolus followed by 4&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg h infusion) and diazepam naloxone combination. Sedation depth, temperature, number of seizures and intensity, whole-body plethysmography parameters and electroencephalography activity were measured. For each parameter, we compared the areas under the curves using Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests for two-by-two comparisons between the four groups. Regarding the effects of treatments on seizures, comparisons were performed using two-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison tests using Bonferroni&#x02019;s correction.</p><p id="Par1140"><bold>Results:</bold> Naloxone reversed tramadol-induced respiratory depression (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) but significantly increased seizures (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01) and prolonged their occurrence time. Diazepam abolished seizures but significantly deepened rat sedation (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) without improving ventilation. Diazepam naloxone combination completely abolished seizures, significantly improved rat ventilation by reducing inspiratory time (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) but did not worsen sedation. Based on the EEG study, tramadol-treated rats experienced electro-clinical seizures as soon as 5&#x000a0;min after the injection, characterized by spike-waves and polyspikes with progressive decreased frequencies and inter-critical phases of slow delta waves until the next crisis. After diazepam naloxone injection, EEG waveforms consisted in 8&#x000a0;Hz-alpha rhythms and slow-down theta rhythms of drowsiness. None of these treatments significantly modified rat temperature.</p><p id="Par1141"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diazepam naloxone combination is the most efficient antidote to reverse tramadol-induced CNS toxicity. Our experimental data greatly encourage administering this combination rather than naloxone alone as first-line antidote in tramadol-poisoned patients as an alternative to tracheal intubation.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec888"><title>P-23 Acute Rubigine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> poisoning in the French Overseas Departments of America: clinical characteristics and prognostic factors</title><sec id="Sec889"><title>Resiere Dabor<sup>1</sup>, Florentin Jonathan<sup>1</sup>, Valentino Ruddy<sup>1</sup>, Brouste Yanick<sup>1</sup>, Gueye Papa<sup>1</sup>, Mehdaoui Hossein<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec890"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU de la Martinique, Fort-De-France, France</title><sec id="Sec891"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Resiere Dabor - dabor.resiere@chu-martinique.fr</title><p id="Par1142"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-23</p><p id="Par1143"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Rubigine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> poisoning is a medical emergency that causes a major public health problem in underdeveloped countries, as it is frequently fatal. This poisoning is rare in France, but frequent in the French overseas departments (DOM). The Rubigine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, made of fluoride and used as a rust remover, is the main source of poisoning in the Caribbean. In Martinique, the exact incidence of this intoxication is unknown, as there is no national and regional register. It could represent up to 8&#x02013;10% of severe acute poisoning. It was not until April 1994 that, following a prefectural order on the declaration, classification, packaging and labeling of substances, the composition of Rubigine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> was modified to significantly reduce the mortality induced by its ingestion. The objective of our study was to describe the clinical features and complications that can occur after ingestion of Rubigine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> as well as to determine the prognostic factors of death.</p><p id="Par1144"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective study over 16&#x000a0;years, from 2000 to 2016, including all patients admitted to emergency and intensive care units of the University Hospital Center (Martinique) for acute Rubigine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> poisoning.

One-quarter of patients had no significant history. The average length of stay was 3.3&#x000a0;days (1&#x02013;37). Forty percent of patients experienced hypocalcaemia after initial intravenous calcium supplementation. Complications included acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation (22% of patients, duration of ventilation&#x02014;2.8&#x000a0;days, (1&#x02013;16)), renal failure (20%, of which 50% required extra-renal treatment, hemodynamic failure (16%), hepatic failure (15%), coagulation failure (15%), neurological failure (12%) and multi-visceral failure (10.9%).

We investigated the effects of various specific pretreatments on tramadol-induced seizure onset and alterations in brain monoamines in the rat.</p><p id="Par1159"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats were randomized into five groups (N&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6 group) to be pretreated with various agonists antagonists before receiving 75&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg tramadol intraperitoneally&#x02014;1.77&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg IP diazepam&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg IV bolus followed by 4&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg h infusion naloxone&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;10&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg IP cyproheptadine, and 15&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg IP fexofenadine. Seizure severity was graded according to the modified Racine Score (1). We measured neurotransmitter concentrations in the frontal cortex using high performance liquid chromatography coupled to flurorimetry or radioenzymatic assay, as required. We used positron emission tomography-computed tomography to investigate Interactions of tramadol with GABA-A receptors. The effects of treatments on seizures were compared using two-way analysis of variance followed by multiple comparison tests with Bonferroni&#x02019;s correction. The Areas under the curves of the effects on monoamine concentrations and the binding potentials in the PET-imaging study were compared two-by-two using Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests.</p><p id="Par1160"><bold>Results:</bold> Diazepam abolished tramadol-induced seizures, by contrast to naloxone, cyproheptadine and fexofenadine pretreatments. Interestingly, despite seizure abolishment, diazepam significantly enhanced tramadol-induced increase in the brain serotonin (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01), histamine (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01), dopamine (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) and norepinephrine (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) while no significant modifications were observed with the other tested pretreatments. Based on Positron emission tomography imaging using 11C-flumazenil fixation in the rat brain, we demonstrated molecular interaction between tramadol and &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-A receptors not related to a competitive mechanism between tramadol and flumazenil on the benzodiazepine binding site. Our findings clearly ruled out the involvement of serotoninergic, opioidergic, histaminergic, dopaminergic and norepinephrinergic pathways in tramadol-induced seizures while strongly suggested tramadol-induced specific allosteric change in GABAA receptors that could contribute to seizures onset in overdose.</p><p>

The clinicobiological severity scores, the reasons for admission to resuscitation were similar in both groups (HIT+&#x000a0;and HIT&#x02212;) as well as the characteristics of the heparins used. The time of occurrence of thrombocytopenia was similar in the two groups. The diagnosis of HIT was more often the only plausible diagnosis in the HIT+&#x000a0;group. The 4T&#x02019;s score was significantly higher in the HIT+&#x000a0;group. The evolution of the platelet count was similar in the two groups, in the decay phases as well as in the recuperation phase.

Acute pulmonary hypertension (PH) in ACS is associated with an increased mortality, but its mechanism remains poorly known.

There were no significant clinical, biological or radiological differences between patients with a low-intermediate probability of acute PH and those with a high probability of acute PH+ their evolution was similar. The exploration of haemostasis did not show between-group differences, regarding each parameter of haemostasis. However, when using a hierarchical cluster analysis, distinct profiles of coagulation were evidenced, defining 3 biological classes. The subset of patients with a high echocardiographic probability of acute PH was more frequent in biological classes 2 and 3 which corresponded to hypercoagulability states. Acute PH was transient in patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;17) with a repeated echocardiography at steady state.</p><p id="Par1177"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Acute PH may likely occur in patients with ACS and a biological condition of hypercoagulability.

Its value for hospitalization and death during hospitalization in a population of patients with lung cancer (LC) consulting at the emergency department has also been demonstrated previously. The aim of our retrospective study was to evaluate the prognostic role of mGPS in LC patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU).</p><p id="Par1180"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We performed a retrospective study in a cancer hospital between September 1st 2008 and December 31st 2013. We included all patients with LC admitted into the ICU for a medical or surgical complication and for whom the data (CRP and albumin levels) used to calculate the mGPS were available.</p><p id="Par1181"><bold>Results:</bold> CRP and albumin values were available to calculate the mGPS in 148 patients with LC admitted in the ICU. The majority of patients were younger than 70&#x000a0;years (72.3%), were male (63.5%) and had non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (79.1%). Cardiovascular (33.1%), respiratory (26.4%) and neurological complications (17.6%) were the three main causes of admissions. Hospital mortality was 26.4%. SAPS 2 score (OR 1.07&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;95% CI 1.03&#x02013;1.11&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) and respiratory distress (OR 3.46&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;95% CI 1.41&#x02013;8.51&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;p 0.007) were the 2 independent predictors of hospital mortality.

This inflammatory score could therefore be used as a long-term prognostic marker in this population of patients and would be more reflective of cancer, than reflecting the acute complication leading to ICU admission.

Every patient admitted, especially when transferred from another hospital, was subjected for the screening. A double swab set was used to collect rectal swab specimens. One swab was used for classical bacteriology and MDR bacterial screening by chromogenic media, and the other swab was reserved for multiplex real-time PCR, which was performed by Cepheid&#x02019;s Gene Xpert Carba-R allowing detection of the 5 most prevalent carbapenemase gene families&#x02014;blaVIM, blaNDM, blaIMP, blaOxa-48 and blaKPC.</p><p id="Par1269"><bold>Results:</bold> Forty-four patients were screened on admission for carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacilli.

The molecular characterization of detected carbapenemases showed the simultaneous presence of multiple target genes in most of samples&#x02014;three genes (blaVIM&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;blaVDM&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;blaOxa-48) in 14 samples (48.2%), both blaVIM&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;blaNDM genes in 4 samples (13.8%), and both blaVIM&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;blaOxa-48 genes in 2 samples (6.8%). Furthermore, 9 samples were positive for only one target gene, as follow the blaVIM in 5 samples (17.2%) and the blaNDM gene in 4 samples (13.8%). The classical bacteriology and parallel screening of MDR bacteriaby chromogenic media detected the presence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli in all molecular positive samples.</p><p id="Par1270"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Most of the patients included in this study were carriers of carbapenemases, 76% of them were transferred from another hospital. Our study describes the characterization of carbapenemases in burn patients and highlights their alarming spread. Thus, detection of colonization may guide the empirical antibiotic therapy. This emphasizes the importance of an isolation policy of transferred patients, and the need of a strategy to limit the spread of the MDR organisms.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec988"><title>P-48 Frequency of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> serotypes in burned patients and their resistance to antibiotics</title><sec id="Sec989"><title>Thabet Lamia<sup>1</sup>, Bourbiaa Yosra<sup>1</sup>, Bouslah Zoubeir<sup>1</sup>, Messadi Amen Allah<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec990"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital de Ben Arous, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec991"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Thabet Lamia - thabetlamia@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1271"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-48</p><p id="Par1272"><bold>Introduction:</bold>

The sites of infection most often involved were the abdomen and lung (50%), there was a predominance of Gram-negative bacilli, the number of organ failure is in average 2.6&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.1. The overall mortality was 65.1%. Prognosis factors related to mortality retained after logistic regression are cardiovascular organ failure followed by neurological.

We developed a research project investigating the reciprocal relationships between bacterial sepsis and cancer. We reported that sepsis-induced immune suppression promoted tumor growth in post-septic mice inoculated with cancer. In a reverse cancer-then-sepsis model we observed that sepsis may conversely inhibit tumor growth. This study aimed at investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms of sepsis-induced tumor inhibition, and most especially the role of monocytes macrophages and Toll-like receptor (Tlr) signaling.</p><p id="Par1315"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We used C57BL 6&#x000a0;J wild-type (WT), Tlr4-/-, Tlr2-/- and Myd88-/- mice. Mice were first subjected to tumor inoculation by subcutaneous injection of MCA205 fibrosarcoma cells. Fourteen days after, mice were subjected to polymicrobial sepsis induced by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Controls were cancer mice subjected to sham surgery. Alternatively, cancer mice were subjected to an i.p. challenge with Tlr agonist (LPS or heat-killed <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (HKSA)). The distribution of tumor-associated immune cells was assessed by FACS at days 1 and 7 following surgery. The activation status of tumor-infiltrating monocytes macrophages was assessed by FACS (MHCII, CD40, CD86, PDL1, PD1). F4/80&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;cells were purified by FACS and we assessed cytokines production (rt-qPCR) and bacteria phagocytosis.</p><p id="Par1316"><bold>Results:</bold> We confirmed polymicrobial sepsis dampens tumor growth in WT mice. A similar CLP-induced tumor growth inhibition was observed in Tlr2-/- mice, but neither in Tlr4-/- nor Myd88-/- mice. A challenge with LPS resulted in a marked anti-tumoral effect, whereas a challenge with HKSA had no impact on tumor growth. Tumor-infiltrating immune cells analysis retrieved monocytes/macrophages predominance with two different subsets based on F4/80 expression (F4/80High and F4/80Low). Late-onset (day 7) tumors from CLP-operated mice displayed increased proportions of F4/80High. As compared to F4/80Low cells, F4/80High cells displayed a more immature status with a lower expression of CD40, MHCII and PDL1, and a higher phagocytic activity. Interestingly, F4/80High cells from CLP-operated mice exhibited a higher phagocytic activity than those from sham-operated mice.</p><p id="Par1317"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Polymicrobial sepsis drives a potent antitumoral activity in cancer mice, which is associated with changes in the distribution and functions of tumor-associated monocytes macrophages subsets. Our results converge on a critical role of Tlr4 signaling, that should be further investigated.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1024"><title>P-57 Critical sepsis and ILCs (CriSIs): a prospective study of circulating innate lymphoid cells in septic shock</title><sec id="Sec1025"><title>Carvelli Julien<sup>1</sup>, Fraisse Megan<sup>1</sup>, Bourenne Jeremy<sup>1</sup>, Vely Fr&#x000e9;d&#x000e9;ric<sup>1</sup>, Vivier Eric<sup>1</sup>, Gainnier Marc<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1026"><title><sup>1</sup>R&#x000e9;animation des Urgences et M&#x000e9;dicale,&#x000a0;Marseille, France</title><sec id="Sec1027"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Carvelli Julien - Julien.CARVELLI@ap-hm.fr</title><p id="Par1318"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-57</p><p id="Par1319"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Immune response to bacterial infection is central in the pathophysiology of septic shock. It is essential to understand it thoroughly in order to identify new biological markers, new therapeutic targets whilst allowing a decrease in morbidity and mortality. After a cytokine storm syndrome, post-aggressive immunosuppression takes place. Within immunologic changes after a severe infection, innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) status remains unknown.</p><p id="Par1320"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We compared prospectively 9 patients hospitalized for septic shock in the medical intensive care unit (ICU) of the teaching hospital La Timone-Marseille to 10 control patients hospitalized in the same unit for another reason (cardiac arrest, trauma). Fresh blood samples were collected and analyzed. An extended lymphocyte phenotyping (B cells, T cells, NK cells, regulatory T cells and ILCs), was conducted as well as an evaluation of HLA-DR expression on circulating monocytes.</p><p id="Par1321"><bold>Results:</bold> There was a trend for more pronounced lymphopenia in septic patients but without statistically significant difference (620/mm3 [166&#x02013;3987] versus 1300/mm3 [598&#x02013;2246], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.15). In addition, septic patients weren&#x02019;t more susceptible to develop a secondary infection (2 secondary infections versus 4 in the control group, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.4). However, septic patients exhibited a decrease in circulating ILC3&#x000a0;s (49&#x000a0;mL [5&#x02013;124] versus 183&#x000a0;mL [38&#x02013;1026], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01). An excess of ILC2&#x000a0;s was found to be associated with a higher risk to develop a secondary infection (314&#x000a0;mL [152&#x02013;621] versus 104&#x000a0;mL [15&#x02013;677], p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05). Finally, immunosuppression was correlated with disease severity (SOFA&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;8).</p><p id="Par1322"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Post-agressive immunosuppression in ICU is not specific to sepsis. In septic shock, the low counts in circulating ILC3&#x000a0;s could be explained by ILC plasticity (conversion of these cells into ILC1&#x000a0;s), by migration from the blood or by an exacerbated apoptosis. ILC2&#x000a0;s expansion, associated with a higher risk of secondary infection, could be promoted by IL-33, released by tissue injuries. ILC2&#x000a0;s could activate regulatory T cells via IL-10. These preliminary results must be confirmed on a larger cohort.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1028"><title>P-58 Measure of regulatory B cells level in peripheral blood of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock</title><sec id="Sec1029"><title>Brault Cl&#x000e9;ment<sup>1</sup>, Guignant Caroline<sup>1</sup>, Titeca Beauport Dimitri<sup>1</sup>, Marolleau Jean-Pierre<sup>1</sup>, Gubler Brigitte<sup>1</sup>, Maizel Julien<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1030"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU AMIENS PICARDIE, Amiens, France</title><sec id="Sec1031"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Brault Cl&#x000e9;ment - brault.clement@chu-amiens.fr</title><p id="Par1323"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-58</p><p id="Par1324"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Sepsis is characterized by a dysregulation of the inflammatory response initiated by the infection. An extreme inflammatory state is responsible of severe shock, multiple organ failure and death. The compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS) includes immunological phenomenons which is aimed at reducing inflammation. Among them, regulatory B cells (Breg) are a lymphocyte subpopulation derived from transitional or marginal zone B cells. They play a suppressive role in the immune system by the secretion of negative regulatory cytokines such as interleukin-10 or by immune cell contact inhibition.

This procedure has not only led to a reduction of morbimortality in ARDS but also in all patients mechanicaly ventilated in intensive care units as well as in major surjery. Nevertheless, the incidence of high volume (VT) on morbimortality is extremely variable (about 8 to 70%). Our main objective is to assess the incidence of high volume ventilation (&#x0003e;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;ml/kg predicted body weight, PBW) in our hospital intensive care units. Moreover we were interested in determining the risk factors of high volume ventilation.</p><p id="Par1377"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective observational study from January to March 2015 in three intensive care units of a tertiary university hospital.

The objective of the study and demonstrate the place of tracheotomy in neuro-resuscitation patients, and prevent its complications.</p><p id="Par1398"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A retrospective descriptive study of 597 patients hospitalized in the neuro-resuscitation unit during the period 1 January to 31 December 2016, of which 113 patients benefited from surgical tracheotomy, is a frequency of 19% of all inpatients during this period. Clinical, para-clinical, etiological, and therapeutic data were collected from hospitalization records.</p><p id="Par1399"><bold>Results:</bold> In a series of 597 hospitalized patients, during the defined period, 113 patients had surgical tracheotomy, a frequency of 19%, in the literature two studies or the data were extremely variable, with 29% in the study Namen versus 2.9% in the Coplin study. Of the 113 tracheotomies, 6 were performed by neurosurgeons, and 107 by resuscitators at a frequency of 95%. The tracheotomy was performed on average 7&#x000a0;days after the intubation of the patients, after verification of the impossibility of the extubation of the latter either for central affection of the ventilatory controls, or reached the mixed nerves and disorders of the laryngo-pharyngeal intersection and according to expert recommendations in 2017&#x02014;Tracheotomy should not be performed in the intensive care unit before the fourth day of mechanical ventilation. Different pathologies that patients suffered and required tracheotomy were: post-operative complications of brain tumors (brain stem and mixed nerves) with 52 patients, a rate of 46%, vascular pathologies (stroke and CVT)), with 32 patients (28%), traumatic pathologies, with 29 patients (26%). 21 cases, 19%, 4 cases of secondary bleeding of the orifice, 2 cases of tracheal stenosis, and 1 case of tracheomalacia. The decan made after pharyngolaryngeal neurological examination, and according to SFAR 2017 recommendations experts suggest that a multidisciplinary decanulation protocol available in resuscitation departments.</p><p id="Par1400"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Tracheotomy in neuro-resuscitation has its place, especially in view of the different complications specific to this type of patient, but no study has demonstrated its improvement in vital prognosis. Post-tracheotomy complications can be considerably reduced if the protocols and expert recommendations are applied.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1087"><title>P-73 Ultasonographic detection of patient-ventilator asynchronies during non-invasive ventilation.

Their detection requires a respiratory muscles activity monitoring. Diaphragmatic ultrasonography is a simple imaging technique available at bedside to assess diaphragm motion. Whether diaphragmatic ultrasonography would allow detecting asynchronies due to leaks during NIV is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess two methods of diaphragmatic ultrasonography (excursion and thickening), coupled with the airway pressure signal to detect patient-ventilator asynchronies during NIV.</p><p id="Par1403"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Nine healthy subjects were placed under NIV and subjected to intentional inspiratory and expiratory leakage on the ventilator circuit to generate delayed cycling and auto-triggering, respectively. The flow, airway pressure and diaphragmatic electromyogram were collected in order to identify the asynchronies generated by the leaks. In the meantime, an ultrasound recording of the excursion of the right diaphragm and of the thickening of the right diaphragmatic zone of apposition were performed and combined with the display of airway pressure on the ultrasound screen. These records were analyzed a posteriori to define the diagnostic performance [including sensitivity (Se), specificity (Spe), positive predictive value (Ppv), and negative predictive value (Npv)] of the excursion and the thickening to detect asynchronies.</p><p id="Par1404"><bold>Results:</bold> The experimental setup generated a median of 34 asynchronies per subject (interquartile range 24&#x02013;44). Auto-triggering was correctly identified by continuous recording of both excursion (Se&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;93%, Spe&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;99%, Ppv&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;93%, and Npv&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;99%, Fig. <xref rid="Fig49" ref-type="fig">1</xref>A) and thickening (Se&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;94%, Spe&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;99%, Ppv&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;95%, Npv&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;99%&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Fig. <xref rid="Fig49" ref-type="fig">1</xref>C).

Moreover, their generalization to critically ill patients may depend on several factors including echogenicity, stability and amplitude of the ultrasound signal in this population.</p><p id="Par1406"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ultrasound is a simple clinical tool available at the bedside to detect delayed cycling and auto-triggering associated with NIV leaks, provided that the airway pressure curve is displayed on the screen of the ultrasound machine. Further studies are needed to assess its usefulness in detecting other types of asynchronies and its feasibility in critically-ill patients.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1091"><title>P-74 Single center experience of ECCO2R</title><sec id="Sec1092"><title>Winiszewski Hadrien<sup>1</sup>, Aptel Francois<sup>1</sup>, Piton Ga&#x000eb;l<sup>1</sup>, Capellier Gilles<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1093"><title><sup>1</sup>CHRU Besan&#x000e7;on, Besancon, France</title><sec id="Sec1094"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Winiszewski Hadrien - hadrien51@hotmail.com</title><p id="Par1407"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-74</p><p id="Par1408"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Although extra-corporeal CO2 removal (ECCO2R) is not recommended, strong rational supports the concept.

If we include&#x000a0;the type of patient in the model, emergency surgery seems protective (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009 vs.&#x000a0;medical or elective surgery).</p><p id="Par1432"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our experience only SAPS II and use of vasopressors in the ICU can predict IHM in VVOP.

However the potential benefit for patients in terms of recovery and discharge versus delayed death in the ICU environment remains debated. We aimed to describe their stay in the ICU and the mortality in the unit.</p><p id="Par1440"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Multicentric observational study. All patients over 85&#x000a0;years old hospitalized in the ICU or attendant intermediate care units were included in seven French participating centers from 2015 to 2016.</p><p id="Par1441"><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 239 patients included, 48 (20%) were over 89&#x000a0;years. 62 (25%) were admit exclusively to intermediate care units. 107 (41%) lived alone at home, 40% in couple or with ther family, 21 (9%) in retirement home and 16 (7%) in nursing home. 40 (17%) had a simplified ALD score lower than 4 indicating good functional independence. The more frequent diagnosis were acute pulmonary oedema and exacerbated COPD. The mean simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) was 53&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;21. The treatment were were invasive mechanical ventilation 84 (36%), only with noninvasive ventilation 50 (21%), vasopressor agents 79 (33%) and 4 (2%) with renal replacement therapy. The average length of stay was 5.9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.1&#x000a0;days. After adjustment on SAPSII (without age), those invasive treatments were not associated with mortality no more than age. Global mortality rate was 28%. 53 (22%) were subject of a procedure for limiting therapeutics, among which 35 (66%) died in the unit versus 17% for the other patients. The decision of therapeutic limitation was associated with severity of illness as measured by the SAPSII (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01) but not with age.

Data collected were: clinical features at admission, acute management procedures, functional characteristics and vital parameters (Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, ABG&#x02019;s) at ICU discharge. Patients were followed during 1&#x000a0;year via phone calls. A multivariate regression analysis was used to identify risk factors for one-year mortality.</p><p id="Par1447"><bold>Results:</bold> During the two-years study period, 102 elderly patients were discharged alive. 60 (58.8%) were male.

We selected patients with an initial VF VT caused by an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and who were successfully treated with early percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on admission. The primary endpoint was the recurrence of major arrhythmia between ICU admission and ICU discharge. All arrhythmias resulting in CA recurrence and or severe arterial hypotension requiring infusion of vasopressors were classified as major arrhythmias. Multivariate logistic regression identified factors associated with the occurrence of major arrhythmias.</p><p id="Par1474"><bold>Results:</bold> Between 01/2007 and 12/2016, 256 consecutive CA patients were included in the analysis.

The only drug used as a prophylactic AA treatment was amiodarone, which was employed in 104/256 patients (41%). Overall, 29/256 patients (11.3%) had a major arrhythmia recurrence during their ICU stay. A large majority of these major arrhythmia recurrences (79.3%) occurred during the first 24&#x000a0;h.

The Physioflow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a new non-invasive method using the waveform analysis of the thoracic impedance signal (TI) to assess CO. In hemodynamicaly unstable patients, no studies have evaluated the level of agreement between the CO estimated by transthoracic echocardiography (CO-TTE) and that measured using the waveform analysis of thoracic Impedance Physioflow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (CO-TI). The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of CO-TI relative to CO-TTE to estimate the absolute CO value and detect the expected variation CO (V-CO) in critically ill patients.</p><p id="Par1488"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Fourteen patients sedated and mechanically ventilated, in shock under catecholamines and monitorred with TTE and TI Physioflow<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were included.

BB may worsen the early circulatoryfailure by limiting the adaptive cardiac and vasopressive response. Recent data suggests that BB could exert a protective role insepsis by improving cardiovascular dynamics. We aimed to investigate hemodynamic parameters and outcomes of septic shockpatients with respect to prior BB treatment.</p><p id="Par1493"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a 9-year (2008&#x02013;2016) retrospective study. All adult patients diagnosed for septic shock within the first 48&#x000a0;h were included. Septic shock was defined as an infection associated with circulatory failure requiring vasopressors. BB treatment was stopped at ICU admission. Qualitative and quantitative parameters were compared using the Chi square or Mann&#x02013;Whitney tests.</p><p id="Par1494"><bold>Results:</bold> Among 938 patients admitted for septic shock, 230 (24.5%) patients were previously treated with BB.

With respect to hemodynamic parameters at ICU admission, patients with prior BB displayed lower heart rates (81[82&#x02013;111] vs. 107[89&#x02013;122] bpm, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01).

However, lots of studies report the impact of the age on the decision to admit a patient to the ICU despite no triage recommendation exists. The primary objective was to determine prognostic factors of death for the 80&#x000a0;years and over at admission to the ICU and secondly to evaluate their functional prognostic at short and medium term after their exit.</p><p id="Par1515"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective and observational study conducted in our ICU 30 beds unit from August 2015 to February 2017. Patients of 80&#x000a0;years and over were listed. The dying patients arriving after a pre-hospital resuscitation for whom no therapeutic plan has been initiated and those admitted for an organ donation were excluded. The primary outcome was the duration between the admission and the potential death during the follow-up. The secondary outcomes were the necessity to entry an healthcare institution or the loss of one autonomy point on the ADL French scale after the hospitalization.</p><p id="Par1516"><bold>Results:</bold> 107 patients of the 1763 admissions were included.

The most common diagnosis were a septic shock (23 patients), a cardiopulmonary arrest (21 patients), a cardiogenic shock (9 patients) and a pulmonary oedema or a lung infection (8 patients each). 75 patients (70.03%) died during the follow up&#x02014;50 at the ICU, 13 during ward and 12 during re-education or after their home return. From a multivariate analysis (Table <xref rid="Tab36" ref-type="table">1</xref>), anisocoria, cardiopulmonary arrest and acute kidney injury (AKI&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;0) seem to be independent risk factors of death. 32 patients were alive at the end of the follow up. 11 recovered their previous autonomy, 8 needed a place in a specialized institution.

Objective&#x02014;To improve the differential diagnosis procedure in cases of post-partum AKI.</p><p id="Par1526"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A hundred and five cases of post-partum AKI, admitted in the last 5&#x000a0;years (2011&#x02013;2015) in French ICU from 9 different regions, were analysed. Initial and final diagnosis, renal features, haemostasis and TMA parameters were all analysed, paying a special attention to their dynamics within the first days following the delivery.</p><p id="Par1527"><bold>Results:</bold> The main circumstances of AKI were severe preeclampsia (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40), post-partum haemorrhage (PPH, n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;20) and primitive TMA (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14, including 10 atypical HUS and 4 thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura). Among the thirteen cases of renal cortical necrosis, 11 were associated with preeclampsia. Congruence between the initial and the final diagnosis was low (63%). Thus, none of the women referred to our centers for a suspicion of non-placental TMA has received a final diagnosis of non-placental TMA (and instead had a PE or a PPH). Conversely, all women with a final diagnosis of non-placental TMA were referred for a suspicion of PE-related TMA, or with a PPH which polluted the diagnosis. Tranexamic acid was largely used in the context of PPH (82%), at a dose up to 5 grams total. Taking into account the final diagnosis, we subjectively concluded that plasma exchanges and eculizumab were abusively indicated in 5 and 2 cases, respectively, of typical HELLP syndrome. Plasma exchanges were in itiated in all 14 cases, a mean 84&#x000a0;h following the admission. Dynamics of hemoglobin, haptoglobin, and liver enzymes were poorly discriminant. The dynamic pattern of LDH and of platelets, in contrast, was statistically different between primitive TMA-related AKI and other groups&#x02014;at day 3, platelets increased in preeclamptic women, and in other circumstances, but not in patients with primitive TMA. A classification and regression tree (CART) independently confirmed the usefulness of platelets and LDH trajectory in the diagnostic algorithm (Fig. <xref rid="Fig53" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig53"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Analysis of post-partum AKI cases</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig53_HTML" id="MO58"/></fig>

The feeding tube is also commonly used to administrate drug therapy as well. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the nurses about this way of administration. This could be a potential source of medicine-related illness. The purpose of this study was first, to evaluate the nurse&#x02019;s knowledge on enteral drug administration, and second, to observe nurses and to evaluate the adequacy of their practices with guidelines, and to report medication-administration errors.</p><p id="Par1567"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This prospective study using the observation technique was conducted in 2 ICU (one medical and one surgical). First, a knowledge and practice questionnaire regarding drug administration trough enteral feeding tube was filled by each intensivist nurse. Secondly, Pharmacist performed observations of nurses during preparation and administration of medications. These practices were compared with the original medical prescription and with the data available in the literature.</p><p id="Par1568"><bold>Results:</bold> 60 questionnaires were returned. 48 nurses evaluated their knowledge as medium and 9 as inadequate. There was a lack of knowledge on the type of drugs which can be used by feeding tube (65 wrong responses). 30 nurses and 71 different drugs were observed during the drug administration phase. No administration totally complied with our institutional protocol, particularly the crush of tablets. When a tablet was crushed, in 31% an alternative formulation (in syrup for example) existed.</p><p id="Par1569"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The correct administration of drugs in feeding tubes is important and represents a challenge in ICU. Firstly, crushed tablets is the most frequent cause of obstruction of feeding tubes which have to be changed&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;secondly, crushed tablets destroys the controlled release of enteric coated dosage forms, resulting in a higher or a lower initial blood level. We have to train nurses for drug administration by feeding tube. On their daily ward, the pharmacist should improve the choice of medication&#x02019;s forms.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1215"><title>P-105 Early outcome of acute variceal hemorrage (avh) in cirrhotic patients: preliminary study</title><sec id="Sec1216"><title>Khedher Sana<sup>1</sup>, Cyrine Abdennebi<sup>1</sup>, Wafa Azaza<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1217"><title><sup>1</sup>Tunis, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec1218"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Khedher Sana - sanakhedher@hotmail.fr</title><p id="Par1570"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-105</p><p id="Par1571"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Acute variceal hemorrhage (AVH) is a severe complication of portal hypertension. In addition, the variceal bleeding is still the most common lethal complication of cirrhosis.

The purpose of this preliminary study was to find the factors associated with poor prognosis of AVH in cirrhotic patients.</p><p id="Par1572"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This is a retrospective study, spread over 12&#x000a0;months between January 2016 and December 2016. Are included all consecutive patients with liver cirrhosis hospitalized for variceal bleeding. We exploited the medical records to identify the clinical, biological and endoscopic parameters.</p><p id="Par1573"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 30 patients hospitalized for AVH occurred during the study period. The mean age at admission was 60&#x000a0;years, and 12 are female. Cirrhosis was post viral in 30% of cases. Patients were classified as Child&#x02013;Pugh C in 40% of cases. The median presenting model for end stage liver disease (MELD) and CLIF SOFA Were respectively 17 and 8.4. Twelve (12) patients received beta-blockers and 15 have required at least one endoscopic variceal band ligation at the time of the bleeding episode. In the acute phase, pharmacological treatment based on vasopressor (sandostatin)) was instituted in all cases and combining with antibiotic prophylaxis (C3G or fluoroquinolone) in 26 cases. In 8 cases the endoscopy was made within 12&#x000a0;h, Active bleeding at endoscopy was observed in 20 patients. Esophageal avarices (OV) were grade I (2 patients) grade II (10 patients) and grade III (18 patients). The eradication of varices was obtained in 23 patients (76.6% percentage of the cases). The variceal bleeding recurred in 9 of patients (30%of cases) and 6 patients died which 4 within the first 5&#x000a0;days. Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis (p 0.010), hepatic encephalopathy (p 0.041) and the hemodynamic instability with schok (p 0.01) are correlated with early mortality at 5&#x000a0;days.

We have previously shown that defining late transit by the absence of stool within 6&#x000a0;days after admission was not relevant because it did not identify a group of patients with specific outcome [1]. To further improve this definition, we investigated the differences in outcome among patients according to their bowel movements frequency.</p><p id="Par1582"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Preliminary results of a prospective, two centers, observational study. All patients admitted to ICU, with a length of stay (LOS) of at least 72&#x000a0;h were eligible and included with the following exceptions&#x02014;abdominal surgery, bowel infection or any baseline condition known to alter transit time. Patients were compared according to stool frequency&#x02014;less than 25%, between 25 and 50%, between 50 and 75% or more than 75% of ICU days. We also tested the former constipation definition of more than 6&#x000a0;days after admission without stool passage.

The most frequent exclusion criteria were LOS&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;72&#x000a0;h (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;140). 68% of the patients had stool less than 50% of ICU days. Patients with fewer bowel movements were more likely to be mechanically ventilated, without association with time spent under MV. There was a link between the time to first stool after admission and the stool frequency during ICU (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). No difference was evidenced regarding SAPS II, ICU LOS, VAP occurrence and survival. When testing the delay of 6&#x000a0;days to first stool as a diagnostic criterion, we found that constipated patients spent more time under MV (9[10.8] vs. 6[8.8] p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004), had a higher LOS (12[11] vs. 6[5] p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) and more VAP (0[0] vs. 0[1] p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03), but no link with survival.</p><p id="Par1584">

Recent data confirmed an improved survival of patient admitted to the Intensive Care Unit with a targeted temperature management (TTM). The diagnosis of AP is then challenging due to immunologic effects and the absence of fever that results from TTM. Alpha amylase is a marker only present in salivary secretions. The aim of our study is to evaluate the performance of broncho-alveolar amylase for early prediction of AP following OHCA with successful resuscitation treated by TTM in the ICU.</p><p id="Par1594"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> All patients admitted for OHCA underwent non-bronchoscopic BAL (Combicath PRODIMED) in ICU. Aspirate was collected after two instillations of 20&#x000a0;ml of isotonic saline. Amylase measurement was realized in the biochemistry laboratory on the first sample. The second sample and the extremity of the Combicath were sent to the microbiology laboratory for culture. All patients had 24&#x000a0;h of TTM between 35&#x02013;36&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C with deep sedation and neuromuscular blocking. Initiation of antibiotic therapy was left to the clinician&#x02019;s appreciation. Diagnosis of AP was independently confirmed by investigators, following the American Thoracic Criteria.</p><p id="Par1595"><bold>Results:</bold> The following results are an intermediate analysis of 41 out of 150 patients planned. Among the 41 patients, 5 have died within 48&#x000a0;h, but only 2 of them without aspiration pneumonia symptoms were excluded. The average age was 53&#x000a0;years&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;14, the average SOFA score at admission was 9&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3. The principal diagnosis for OHCA was acute coronary syndrome (26%). An alpha amylase level superior or equal to 4 UI L was associated with the occurrence of AP with a sensitivity of 69.2 (0.05&#x02013;0.83) and a specificity of 73.3 (0.48&#x02013;0.89). The area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.788. The negative predictive value was only 58%.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figs_HTML" id="MO60"/>
</p><p id="Par1596"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Level of alpha amylase observed here is lower than in a study conducted by Weiss and al.. Indeed, a cut-off of 125 UI L was found, but all the samples were collected by bronchoscopic BAL.

Hypermucoid strains accounted for two thirds of community infections whereas the non-mucoid profile was predominantly found in nosocomial infections (72.5 vs. 33.4%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.01) There was no significant difference in mortality (KpHM 46.7 vs. Kpc 15%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.07) but patients with a KpHM strain had a longer hospital stay (73.5&#x000a0;days versus 50.7&#x000a0;days), a higher number of infectious metastases (OR 7.06, CI 95% 1.25&#x02013;39.64&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.026), and a longer persistence of positive blood cultures despite the implementation of a suitable treatment (OR 1.41, CI 95 1.01&#x02013;1.96&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.045).</p><p id="Par1602"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Community-acquired or nosocomial KP bacteraemias represent severe infections where resuscitation is required in half of the cases. This probably explains why there is no difference in mortality between the two groups. However, it can be assumed that the trend of excess mortality in the KpHM group is not significant due to insufficient sample size.</p><p id="Par1603"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Due to their persistent and metastatic nature, bacteremia with KpHM should be considered severe and have to be closely monitored. Prolonged antibiotic therapy should be discussed.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1239"><title>P-111 Procalcitonin guided antibiotic therapy during severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring mechanical ventilation: a before after study</title><sec id="Sec1240"><title>Nakaa Sabrine<sup>1</sup>, Tilouche Nejla<sup>1</sup>, Sikali Habiba<sup>1</sup>, Jaoued Oussema<sup>1</sup>, Gharbi Rim<sup>1</sup>, Fekih Hassen Mohamed<sup>1</sup>, Elatrous Souheil<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1241"><title><sup>1</sup>EPS Taher Sfar, Mahdia, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec1242"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Nakaa Sabrine - nakaasabrine89@hotmail.com</title><p id="Par1604"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-111</p><p id="Par1605"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Antibiotic therapy during acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) still controversial and not well supported by clinical evidence.

The side effects of this drug as well as the increasing resistance and its pharmacodynamics effects have fostered the development of newly active drugs. Nevertheless it is still widely prescribed and it stands as the mostly used comparator in randomized study. An assessment of our medical practice regarding its use may enhance compliance to guidelines so as to promote a better use of Vancomycin.</p><p id="Par1616"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> In our 1600 bed hospital, the incidence rate of MRSA fell from 0.38 to 0.24 per 1000 patient days from 2007 to 2012 whereas the current proportion of MRSA isolates is about 11%. Vancomycin is the most prescribed empirical or targeted antibiotic therapy covering MRSA in our medical intensive care unit of 20 beds even if a shift towards the use of linezolid in nosocomial pneumoniae has been noticed during the last 3&#x000a0;years. Key points regarding the proper use of Vancomycin have been implemented in our antibiotic stewardship program. Moreover courses concerning this topic are provided to our junior doctors. A retrospective review of the quality of antibiotic use has been carried out in 45 courses of Vancomycin therapy and the following criteria have been assessed&#x02014;indication, dosing schedules, serum levels of Vancomycin, duration of antibiotic therapy and the overall degree of conformity of the prescription.</p><p id="Par1617"><bold>Results:</bold> Regarding indication, conformity was observed in42 cases (93%).

The loading dose was inappropriate in 23 cases (51%) and the proper follow up of serum levels of vancomycin has not been carried out in 20 cases (44%). The duration of antibiotic therapy was in compliance with the protocol in 42 cases (93%) and a slight longer duration was observed in 3 cases (7%).

</p><p id="Par1628"><bold>Discussion:</bold> In the SFAR SRLF guideline, the limitation of the echinocandins use to the benefit of ampho deoxycholate explains most of the poor agreement or consensus rate between investigators. The IDSA ESCMID guideline are more helpful to guide indications of empirical treatment which mainly explains their higher rate of both applicability and agreement rate.

We analyzed prevalence, demographics, clinical impact, and management of this paralysis.</p><p id="Par1632"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We identified retrospectively 20 cases of diaphragmatic paralysis in children, in 1500 cardiac surgeries, between 2006 and 2016, in a University hospital pediatric ICU.</p><p id="Par1633"><bold>Results:</bold> The prevalence of diaphragmatic paralysis was 1.3% (20 1500). Median age at cardiac surgery, for children with diaphragmatic paralysis, was 6.1&#x000a0;months (range 4&#x000a0;days to 5&#x000a0;years). The vast majority of operations were open-heart surgery (85%). Arterial switch operation (50%, 10 20), ventricular and or auricular septal defect closure (20%, 4 20), and Blalock-Taussig Shunt (10%, 2 20) were the three top leading causes of diaphragmatic paralysis. The most commonly used approach was median sternotomy. Only two cases of thoracotomy approach have been reported. The diagnosis was suspected for 32% on clinical signs (6 19), and was discovered during a chest X-ray examination for 68% (13 19). Diaphragmatic paralysis was confirmed for all cases with chest ultrasound.39% of patients (7 18) were receiving mechanical ventilation at the moment of the diagnosis. The paralysed hemidiaphragm was left sided in 52% (10 19), and right sided in 48% (9 19). There was no bilateral diaphragmatic paralysis. Hemi-diaphragmatic plication was performed in 30% of the patients (6 20), and median time from cardiac surgery to surgical plication was 21&#x000a0;days (range 8&#x02013;38&#x000a0;days). Indications for plication were failure to wean from ventilator (100%, 6 6), and respiratory distress (33%, 2 6). Plicatured patients were remarkably younger (median age at cardiac surgery&#x02014;23&#x000a0;days, range 4&#x02013;82&#x000a0;days) than non-plicatured patients (7.7&#x000a0;months, range 5&#x000a0;days-5&#x000a0;years). The median ventilation time after plication was 3&#x000a0;days (range 2&#x02013;6&#x000a0;days). All patients were asymptomatic after diaphragmatic plication. Two patients died (10%). Cause of death was independant from surgical plication (cardiogenic shock, septic shock).</p><p id="Par1634"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Diaphragmatic paralysis is a rare but serious complication of cardiac surgery in children. It commonly occurs after open-heart surgery, and specifically after arterial switch operation. Plicatured patients were younger than non-plicatured patients and needed more frequently a ventilatory support. A closer monitoring may be required for young patients and mechanically ventilated patients. Indeed, both are more likely to be treated by a diaphragmatic plication, reducing mechanical ventilation and intensive care duration.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1263"><title>P-117 Assessment of Esophageal pressure reliability to estimate pleural pressure in critically ill children</title><sec id="Sec1264"><title>Mortamet Guillaume<sup>1</sup>, Nardi Nicolas<sup>2</sup>, Jouvet Philippe<sup>2</sup>, Essouri Sandrine<sup>2</sup>, Emeriaud Guillaume<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1265"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU Grenoble,&#x000a0;Grenoble, France; <sup>2</sup>CHU Sainte-Justine, Montr&#x000e9;al, CANADA</title><sec id="Sec1266"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Mortamet Guillaume - mortam@hotmail.fr</title><p id="Par1635"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-117</p><p id="Par1636"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Despite data demonstrating usefulness of Esophageal pressure (PES) measurement in critically ill patients, several confounding factors that can affect the accuracy of PES measurement have been highlighted in the literature. This study aims to determine whether the values of PES measured in critically ill children are consistent with expectations based on fundamental principles of lung and chest wall mechanics. To reach this goal, we wanted to validate the reliability of PES-based method using a direct PES measurement when compared to direct PPL measurement in situ.</p><p id="Par1637"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> A prospective study. Consecutive children aged between 7&#x000a0;days and 18-year-old admitted to the PICU, intubated and mechanically ventilated were eligible and they reached inclusion if they had at least one chest tube. PPL was directly measured by a pressure transducer connected through a needle inserted into the existing chest tube. PES was measured by both a specific probe (Gaeltec probe) and by the feeding tube after mobilization (PES-FT).</p><p id="Par1638"><bold>Results:</bold> 12 patients (median age 3&#x000a0;months (interquartile&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;1&#x02013;4)) were included and exploitable signals were finally available in 9 patients, who were included in the analysis.

Three to 11% of bronchiolitis episodes require hospitalisation in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). Apnea is one of the most commonly encountered complications (1.6 to 5%). Considering the established use of caffeine in the treatment of apnea of prematurity, some PICU teams have extrapolated this data to apnea in bronchiolitis and consider caffeine as a part of its management. However, for there is a lack of data regarding the use of caffeine in bronchiolitis related apnea, there is no recommendation or standard of care across PICUs worldwide. The objective of this study was to describe the management of bronchiolitis related apnea in the PICU and explore the effect of caffeine on clinical outcomes as well as its potential adverse effects in this indication.</p><p id="Par1642"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective study in the PICU of the level 3 university hospital of Caen between January 1st, 2009 and December 31st, 2016. All children under 1&#x000a0;year old with a diagnosis of bronchiolitis related apnea admitted in the PICU were included. Patients were allocated in one of the two groups (control or caffeine group) depending on the administration of caffeine.</p><p id="Par1643"><bold>Results:</bold> Fifty four infants were included. Caffeine treatment was administered in 49 patients (91%). Patients&#x02019; characteristics were similar between groups. Overall median age was 24&#x000a0;days [18&#x02013;38] and median weight was 3260&#x000a0;g [2810&#x02013;3810]. Respiratory syncytial virus was identified in 38 infants (70%). An initial caffeine citrate loading dose of 20&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg was usually administered, followed by a 5&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;day maintenance dose, for a median treatment duration of 3&#x000a0;days [1&#x02013;6]. Therapeutic management (invasive and non-invasive ventilation, nutrition support) and clinical outcomes (death, length of stay) were similar between groups. There was no difference in potential caffeine adverse effects between groups or within the caffeine exposed group pre and post-caffeine administration.</p><p id="Par1644"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Caffeine treatment of bronchiolitis related apnea seems to be a standard practice in our PICU. Our study failed to show any influence of caffeine on clinical outcomes in this indication when compared with a small number of patients. Further studies are needed to assess the efficacy and safety of caffeine treatment in this indication as well as the appropriate treatment regimen as pharmacokinetic data suggest that higher dose could be of great interest in this non-prematurely born population.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1271"><title>P-119 Incidence and Risk Factors of Catheter-Associated Thrombosis in Critically Ill Children</title><sec id="Sec1272"><title>Fareh Mohamed Karim<sup>1</sup>, Malouch Abir<sup>1</sup>, Marzouk Mahmoud<sup>1</sup>, Nasri Oussama<sup>1</sup>, Tounsi Mariem<sup>1</sup>, Ben Khalifa Sonia<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1273"><title><sup>1</sup>Tunis, Tunisia</title><sec id="Sec1274"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Fareh Mohamed Karim - fareh.karim@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1645"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-119</p><p id="Par1646"><bold>Introduction:</bold> During the last decade, many authors have raised awareness concerning the increasing rate of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in critically ill children [1]. The presence of central venous catheter (CVC) is one of the most important risk factor for venous thrombosis in children [2]. The purpose of this study was to analyze incidence and risk factors for catheter-related thrombosis in children admitted in our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU).</p><p id="Par1647"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> All children aged less than 2&#x000a0;years, admitted in the PICU from January 2016 to June 2017, and receiving at least one tunneled CVC, were included in our retrospective study.

To date, HLA-DR has been assessed in adults as a predictor of septic complications after various injuries, notably after cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). However, to our knowledge, no study has specifically focused on HLA-DR expression among neonates undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB, which have a high risk of nosocomial infection (NI). In this pilot study, we investigated the kinetic of monocyte HLA-DR expression in this population and described the relationship between monocyte HLA-DR expression and the subsequent development of NI.</p><p id="Par1663"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Blood samples were collected from neonates preoperatively at line insertion, and 1, 2, 3 and 4&#x000a0;days after the end of CPB. The number of HLA-DR molecules per monocyte (AB c) was determined by flow cytometry on whole blood using a Quantibrite phycoerythrin fluorescence quantitation kit (BD Biosciences). NI were defined based on the Center of Disease Control (CDC) and National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance criteria and were prospectively recorded during the PICU stay or within 30&#x000a0;days after surgery.</p><p id="Par1664"><bold>Results:</bold> Nine patients were included with a median RACHS-1 operative risk score at 4 [3&#x02013;6], a median age of 12&#x000a0;days [6&#x02013;23] and a median weight of 2.9&#x000a0;kg [2.0&#x02013;4.0]. The median duration of CPB was 164&#x000a0;min [54&#x02013;272]. There was a significant reduction in HLA-DR expression for the first two postoperative days, as compared to preoperatively (Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). Moreover, three patients (33%) displayed an episode of NI 3&#x000a0;days, 4&#x000a0;days and 8&#x000a0;days after CPB. Interestingly, we observed that these 3 patients had a lower HLA-DR expression at day 4, as compared to patients without NI (4257 AB c [2220&#x02013;5895] vs. 14947 AB c [9858&#x02013;16960]&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Mann Witney test, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04).<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figu_HTML" id="MO62"/>
</p><p id="Par1665"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> We report here that neonates had a reduction in HLA-DR expression after CPB, and those with prolonged decreased HLA-DR in the early postoperative period (Day 4) could represent a subpopulation at greatly increased risk of later NI. If confirmed in a larger cohort of patients, our findings could indicate that HLA-DR may be a useful biomarker of immunosuppression after CPB in neonates.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1287"><title>P-123 Non-traumatic hemorrhagic stroke (NTHS) in comatose children: epidemiological features and clinical presentation</title><sec id="Sec1288"><title>Vergnaud Estelle<sup>1</sup>, Terzi Eleonora<sup>1</sup>, Baugnon Thomas<sup>1</sup>, Meyer Philippe<sup>1</sup>, Orliaguet Gilles<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1289"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Necker, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec1290"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Vergnaud Estelle - estelle.vergnaud@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1666"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-123</p><p id="Par1667"><bold>Introduction:</bold> There are few studies describing the epidemiological features and clinical presentation of non-traumatic hemorrhagic stroke (NTHS) (1, 2).

The observed overall mortality was significantly lower than in previous series (3), and may be related to an aggressive on site resuscitation, and a transport of patients in a neurosurgical center as soon as possible (3).</p><p>

Because of the risks of mechanical ventilation (MV), such as ventilator-associated pneumoniae, it is recommended to begin the weaning process as soon as weaning criteria occurs [1]. However, extubation is also a hazardous period, with 5 to 15% of subsequent respiratory failure requiring reintubation, harboring a dismal prognosis [2]. International guidelines display the criteria triggering the extubation. Nevertheless, the physician in charge eventually takes the decision to extubate. In this regard, there could be variations from an individual to another. The main goal of our study was to identify the perceived impediments to MV weaning among physicians, from intubation to extubation.</p><p id="Par1673"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective single center study in a 12 bed university ICU. All patients admitted between February and May 2017 and undergoing MV were included. We daily registered the existence of the criteria recommending a spontaneous breathing trial (SBT), the occurrence of a SBT, the items recommending postponing extubation, and the occurrence of an extubation. The estimated reasons for all the aforementioned decisions were asked to the physician in charge.</p><p id="Par1674"><bold>Results:</bold> 25 patients were included, gathering 298&#x000a0;days of MV and 42 SBT. The average duration of MV was 8.25&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;9.4&#x000a0;days. There was one extubation failure requiring reintubation. There were 9 SBT failures. In 9 cases, SBT was a success but did not lead to extubation because of hypotonia, weak cough, subsequent respiratory failure, hemorrhagic bronchial secretions, hemodynamic instability, absence of weaning criteria, drowsiness (all the aforementioned n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1), post SBT hypercapnia (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2). 23 out of the 42 SBT (55%) were done while one or several weaning criteria were absent. Impediments to weaning trials were different according to the time lag since ICU admission, with fluid overload, muscular weakness and persistent need for assist control ventilation settings being the most frequent reasons advocated after 7&#x000a0;days (figure). No objective assessment of muscular or cough strength was performed at any time, neither was monitored the RR Vt, vital capacity or inspiratory pressure.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figv_HTML" id="MO63"/>
</p><p id="Par1675"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Reasons for postponing a weaning trial or an extubation depended on the time lag from intubation, and were not always supported by objective criteria.

Home ventilators are sometimes used in intermediate care (because of cost effectiveness or to adapt the patient before home return). Bench and rare clinical studies showed that FiO<sub>2</sub> decreases with occurrence of leaks but none of the studies compares FiO<sub>2</sub> during normobaric LTOT with FiO<sub>2</sub> during NIV. We hypothesize that NIV with home ventilators induces a loss of FiO<sub>2</sub> compared to normobaric oxygen therapy.</p><p id="Par1683"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> To compare&#x02013;Pharyngeal FiO<sub>2</sub> with nasal O2 supply -And FiO<sub>2</sub> during NIV at the same O2 flow with a home ventilatorIn ICU and intermediate care patients, we measured consecutively-Pharyngeal FiO<sub>2</sub> (G5 Philips side stream FiO<sub>2</sub>) with O2 supply through a nasal cannula at basal flow (flow needed by patient). In order to compare FiO<sub>2</sub> we measured FiO<sub>2</sub> with 75, 50 and 25% of basal Flow -FiO<sub>2</sub> during a 30&#x000a0;min NIV trial (pressure support ventilation&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;Vivo 50, Breas), using a facial mask (Comfort Gel Philips) with O2 flow set as the basal flow above.</p><p id="Par1684"><bold>Results:</bold> We performed 15 sequences in 9 patients.

To sum up, with NIV the resulting FiO<sub>2</sub> was corresponding to a 50% O2 withdrawal for half of the time.<fig id="Fig55"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Comparison of FiO<sub>2</sub> (%) with oxygen standard or noninvasive ventilation</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig55_HTML" id="MO64"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par1685"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Compared to normobaric LTOT the FiO<sub>2</sub> is lower during NIV with the same O2 flow. Compensation for intentional and non-intentional leaks and so an increase of air flow despite a constant O2 input might explain this. In intermediate care the use of HV for NIV may be interesting alternative in which case the clinician must keep in mind that the FiO<sub>2</sub> decreases compared to standard oxygen therapy. Concerning home usage we hypothesize that this partial removal of O2 treatment could contribute to the poor results of NIV in chronic COPD.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1303"><title>P-127 Prolonged ICU stays and difficult-to-wean-patients: first year of experience in a french Post ICU Rehabilitation Center</title><sec id="Sec1304"><title>Morawiec Elise<sup>1</sup>, Delemazure Julie<sup>1</sup>, Dres Martin<sup>1</sup>, Mayaux Julien<sup>1</sup>, Dangers Laurence<sup>1</sup>, Similowski Thomas<sup>1</sup>, Demoule Alexandre<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1305"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Piti&#x000e9; Salp&#x000ea;tri&#x000e8;re,&#x000a0;Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec1306"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Morawiec Elise - elisemorawiec@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1686"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-127</p><p id="Par1687"><bold>Introduction:</bold> In February 2016, we opened a 12 beds-post ICU rehabilitation center (Service de R&#x000e9;&#x000e9;ducation Post R&#x000e9;animation,&#x000a0;&#x000ab;SRPR&#x000bb;), dedicated to weaning from mechanical ventilation and global post ICU rehabilitation.

Tracheostomy improves patient comfort compared with standard intubation without survival benefits. However, this procedure is associated with a non-negligible morbi-mortality rarely described in the literature. The objective of our study was to describe the characteristics of the tracheostomized population and complications secondary to tracheostomy.</p><p id="Par1703"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Our observational, retrospective study included all tracheostomized patients from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2015, admitted to the medical ICU department of Central Hospital of CHRU Nancy&#x02019;s. We investigated the presence of risk factors associated with tracheostomy complications, mechanical ventilation duration, length of stay in ICU and intra-hospital mortality.</p><p id="Par1704"><bold>Results:</bold> Our study identified 295 patients who underwent a tracheostomy for the following indications&#x02014;ventilatory comfort in chronic neuromuscular disorders (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;141), mechanical ventilation withdrawal in intensive care polyneuropathy (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;140) and upper airway obstruction (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14). The median age of the population was 62&#x000a0;years (Q1 49 &#x00026; Q3 72), the median BMI was 24.8&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;m<sup>2</sup> (Q1 21.7 &#x00026; Q3 27.8) and the median IGS2 score was 51 (38 &#x00026; Q3 65). The median cannula size of tracheostomy was 8&#x000a0;mm. The procedures were percutaneously performed in 73.6% of the cases with systematic tracheal fibroscopy, and more than a third of the cases (38.7%) were performed by medical resident. The complications rate was 21.7%, including early complications in the first week in 52.8% of the cases. 32.6% of the complications were serious. No risk factors for complications were identified. 141 patients were decannulated with a median time of 31&#x000a0;days (Q1 17 &#x00026; Q3 63). 8.1% of patients had otolaryngologist follow-up. The overall mortality of the studied population was 30.1% including mortality related to tracheostomy in 2 patients. The tracheostomy for extended mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with an increase of mechanical ventilation duration before tracheostomy (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), duration of mechanical ventilation (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), length of stay in intensive care unit (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) and mortality rate (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.0003).</p><p id="Par1705">

Screening of patients at risk of failure is a fundamental step in the weaning process.

The left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac output (CO), maximum velocity of the mitral waves E and A and the tissue mitral annular wave E&#x02019;, deceleration time of mitral E wave (DTE), difference between the pulmonary A and mitral A times [(Ap-Am) time], the Flow propagation velocity of mitral flow (Vp) and its derived ratio E Vp were measured and compared between weaning success (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;31) versus failure (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;22) and between PSV-PEEP (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;53) versus T-Tube test (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;37).</p><p id="Par1710"><bold>Results:</bold> 53 patients were studied and 22 weaning failures were retained (16 in the PSV-PEEP mode and 6 in the T-tube test).

Hypoalbuminemia, acidemia, acute elevation of free fatty acids concentrations may result in poor correlation of total calcium with direct measurements of iCa.

Despite its widespread use, usfulness of routine calcium measurement is not warranted and may lead to misinterpretation of the concentration of calcium and hazardous diagnosis of dyscalcemia.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1327"><title>P-133 Central diabete insipide in our departement of neuroreanimation</title><sec id="Sec1328"><title>Triki Hadjer<sup>1</sup>, Naili Amine<sup>1</sup>, Bouali Djouheur<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1329"><title><sup>1</sup>EHS Neuro, Tipasa, Algeria</title><sec id="Sec1330"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Triki Hadjer - batchhadjer26@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1718"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-133</p><p id="Par1719"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Central diabetes insipidus (CDI) is defined by the inability to retain free water, it is due to an insufficient release of the anti-diuretic hormone by the hypothalamus.

Recent prospective studies including few patients have suggested the interest of hypertonic sodium lactate for vascular filling among critically ill patients and for the treatment of intracranial hypertension. The metabolic effects of sodium lactate in the context of the ICU have been poorly documented. We aimed to describe hemodynamic and metabolic effects of an infusion of molar sodium lactate administered in critically ill patients.</p><p id="Par1730"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This was a retrospective study performed in a large University Hospital. All patients receiving the molecule were included in the analysis. Indication for sodium lactate, dose, and modality of administration were collected. We also collected clinical and biological variables before sodium lactate infusion, after 6&#x000a0;h (H6), and after 24&#x000a0;h (H24). An analysis of the evolution of these variables at H6 and H24 was performed.</p><p id="Par1731"><bold>Results:</bold> Between January 2016 and May 2017, 104 patients, aged 64&#x000a0;years, 66% males, SOFA score 9 [7&#x02013;12], received an infusion of molar sodium lactate (250&#x000a0;ml [250&#x02013;250]). Main indications for sodium lactate were hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (68%), vascular filling (15%), mixed acidosis (12%), and intracranial hypertension (5%). 84% of the patients presented with a chloride sodium ratio&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.76 at basal time. Sodium lactate was associated with a significant increase of mean arterial pressure at H6 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.009) and H24 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003), a decrease of catecholamine dose (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.002) and heart rate (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.05) at H24, and an increase of diuresis in the 6&#x000a0;h period following initiation of the treatment (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). We observed an increase of pH, bicarbonate, base excess, and sodium, at H6 and H24 (all p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Plasma lactate concentration was increased at H6 (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001), but was not different from basal value at H24 (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.99).

</p><p id="Par1737"><bold>Discussion:</bold> We describe for the first time the occurrence of euglycemic ketoacidosis in critically ill patients under CRRT using glucose-free replacement solution. Common features of the patients were multiple organ failure with anuria, normal glycemia without insulin infusion and low glucose infusion or food intake. Critical illness-induced insulin resistance and starvation could altogether contribute to ketoacidosis even if acidosis is unusual in starvation ketosis. By removing substantial amounts of glucose from the blood, CRRT with glucose free solution could worsen this condition, mask hyperglycemia and induce euglycemic ketoacidosis.</p><p id="Par1738"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In critically ill patients on CRRT using glucose free solution, euglycemic ketoacidosis is common and should be detected, especially in patients with low glucose intake, no insulin infusion and unexplained metabolic acidosis. Importantly, the diagnosis can be missed in anuric patients with normal blood glucose and in the absence of known diabetes. Since, CVVHDF-induced ketoacidosis may contribute to persistent acidemia and its adverse effects, serum or CRRT effluent fluid ketone level should be measured in this setting.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1343"><title>P-137 Epidemiology, clinical features and management of severe hypercalcemia in critically ill patients</title><sec id="Sec1344"><title>Mousseaux Cyril<sup>1</sup>, Ghrenassia Etienne<sup>2</sup>, Kerhuel Lionel<sup>2</sup>, Ardisson Fanny<sup>2</sup>, Ekpe Kenneth<sup>2</sup>, Lemiale Virginie<sup>2</sup>, Mariotte Eric<sup>2</sup>, Schlemmer Benoit<sup>2</sup>, Azoulay Elie<sup>2</sup>, Zafrani Lara<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1345"><title><sup>1</sup>Paris, France; <sup>2</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Saint Louis, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec1346"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Mousseaux Cyril - mousseaux.cyril@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1739"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-137</p><p id="Par1740"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Hypercalcemia (HCM) affects about 3% of patients admitted in the ICU, and is associated with mortality.

All patients hospitalized with a severe HCM (defined by a calcemia above 3&#x000a0;mmol liter) at admission were included. Univariate and univariable prognosis analyses were made with Fisher exact test (Software R v3.2.2).</p><p id="Par1742"><bold>Results:</bold> We included 78 patients (female n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;40 (51.2%)) aged of 58 [39.5&#x02013;67] years. Main reasons for admission were hypercalcemia (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;55 (70.5%)), followed by acute encephalopathy (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9 (11.5%)). Median SAPS II and SOFA scores were 32 [22.25&#x02013;39.5] and 3 [1&#x02013;5] respectively. Main causes of HCM were hematological malignancies (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;46 (59%)), solid tumors (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15 (19%)), iatrogenic events (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;9 (9%)) and endocrinopathies (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5 (6%)). Median calcium levels at admission, at day 3 and at ICU discharge were 3.68 [3.43&#x02013;4.21], 2.75 [2.55&#x02013;3.12] and 2.56 [2.15&#x02013;3.14] mmol L respectively. More than half of the patients (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;46 (59%)) recovered from HCM 5&#x000a0;days after ICU admission.

Digestive events occurred in 29 (37.1%) patients. Cardiovascular events concerned 49 (63%) patients and consisted in de novo hypertension in 18 (23%) patients, and EKG disturbances in 24 (30%) patients. During ICU stay, 9 (11.5%) patients required mechanical ventilation and 6 (7.6%) patients required vasopressors. Volume resuscitation with crystalloids was the first treatment in 73 (93.5%) patients, 63 (80.7%) received bisphosphonates and 48 (61.5%) received corticosteroids. Respective ICU and hospital mortality were 11.5 and 21.7%. There was no correlation between the degree of HCM and ICU mortality (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.1).

The mechanisms of this higher mortality remain poorly understood. Sepsis and chronic kidney disease are both conditions associated with a higher plasmatic concentration of bile acids. The Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) is a key regulator of the bile acid metabolism and has recently been involved in the regulation of the inflammasome during sepsis. We explored the role of FXR in the prognostic of sepsis in an animal model of CKD.</p><p id="Par1746"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Sepsis was provoked by the injection of 0.5&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;kg of LPS 6&#x000a0;weeks after the creation of CKD. The CKD was created by unilateral nephrectomy associated with contralateral thermocauterisation. The mice (C57BL6&#x000a0;J) were randomly assigned to one of the following groups&#x02014;sham placebo, CKD placebo, sham LPS or CKD LPS. A fifth group of CKD LPS mice received a treatment with sevelamer (a bile acid sequestrant) during 6&#x000a0;weeks. Survival of the animals, serum biochemistry and molecular biology in the kidney were performed after sacrifice.</p><p id="Par1747"><bold>Results:</bold> Whereas the sham LPS animals survived, all CKD LPS animals died during the 72&#x000a0;h following the injection of LPS. The plasmatic urea, IL1beta and TNFa concentrations increased with the creation of CKD (CKD placebo versus sham placebo animals) and with the creation of sepsis (CKD LPS versus sham LPS groups). Whereas the expression of FXR RNA did not changed with the injection of LPS in the sham animals (sham LPS versus sham placebo), the FXR RNA decreased with the creation of sepsis in the CKD animals (CKD LPS versus CKD placebo groups). The CKD animals treated with sevelamer 6&#x000a0;weeks before the administration of LPS (CKD sev LPS group) had a lower plasmatic concentration of Il1b, TNFa and increased the RNA expression of FXR in the kidney compared to the CKD LPS group. Also, the treatment with sevelamer improved the survival of the CKD LPS animals.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figw_HTML" id="MO67"/>
</p><p id="Par1748"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> our study demonstrates a relation between FXR and the prognostic of sepsis in CKD animals. The exact link and the potential therapeutic interest of targeting FXR and bile acids metabolism in CKD patients remain to be studied.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1351"><title>P-139 Estimation of 24-Hour electrolyte Excretion Using Urine Samples in ICU</title><sec id="Sec1352"><title>Sboui Ghada<sup>1</sup>, Beji Olfa<sup>1</sup>, Atig Rabia<sup>1</sup>, Baroudi Jamila<sup>1</sup>, Ben Rejeb Mohamed<sup>1</sup>, Bouslama Ali<sup>1</sup>, Hmouda Houssem<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1353"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Sahloul, Sousse, Tunisie</title><sec id="Sec1354"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Sboui Ghada - ghadasb@hotmail.com</title><p id="Par1749"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-139</p><p id="Par1750"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Dysnatraemia, dyskalaemia and hypomagnesemia are frequent metabolic disorders in intensive care, and their causes represent a major concern for the intensivist, especially in urgent conditions. In the diagnostic approach, we often use the urine analysis. Although measurement of 24-hour urine electrolyte excretion (24-HU) is considered the most reliable method, the great burden and difficulty in collecting complete 24-hour urine has prompted the search for more practical methods, such as spot urine analysis. The aim of the present study was to compare electrolyte excretion in urine samples collected over different time periods, in comparison with a 24-hour urine sample collection considered as the gold standard method.</p><p id="Par1751"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This prospective and descriptive study included 30 patients admitted in a tunisian medical ICU, between September and December 2015. Baseline characteristics, medications and laboratory data including electrolytes and renal function parameters were obtained from all patients.

Our objective was to describe the drug user profiles, the drug used and events requiring medical intervention, transfer to the emergency department and admission to the ICU.</p><p id="Par1772"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a prospective observational study including all patients who visited the SIS during the last 12&#x000a0;months. The collection of the usual anonymous demographic, medical and toxicological data was performed by the care-givers and social workers in charge of the drug users. Data were declarative and no analytical confirmation was available except for the patients admitted in the ICU.</p><p id="Par1773"><bold>Results Discussion</bold> During 10&#x000a0;months, 818 drug users [F M sex ratio 0.13&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;median age 37.8&#x000a0;years (21&#x02013;69)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;patients without resources (40%), without medical insurance (27%), unstable housing homelessness (52%)] visited the SIS for drug injection or inhalation, representing 50,060 drug use including 14,587 inhalations and 35,473 injections by 180 drug users day. Drug users had no addictology (48%) or socio-medical (27%) follow-up. They were infected by hepatitis virus C (44%) and or HIV (5%). They declared to continue injecting in the public space (52%), sharing material (13%), and needles syringes (47%). The injected inhaled drugs in the SIS were Skenan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (morphine, 42.6%), crack (43% including 1 3 injections), methadone (6.3%), buprenorphine (6.1%), heroine (1.2%), and cocaine (0.89%). These drugs were self-administered by polydrug users declaring concomitantly consuming crack (72.0%), illicit morphine (68.5%), cocaine (34.8%), ethanol (33.7%), cannabis (33.4%), heroin (29.9%), illicit methadone (20.4%), benzodiazepines (13.6%) and illicit buprenorphine (9.5%). Forty-five patients required a paramedical intervention in the SIS resulting in 17 calls to the emergency department and 15 hospital admissions including 2 transfers to the ICU in relation to opioid overdose. No cardiac arrest and no death occurred.</p><p id="Par1774"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> SIS visit for recreational drug self-administration rapidly becomes popular among drug users. Illicit morphine (Skenan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) represents the first self-administered drug. SIS seems safe, highlighting the effective collaboration set up with the neighboring hospital.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1371"><title>P-144 Chronic digitalis poisoning treated with anti-digoxin Fab: a critical analysis of treatment indications and patient outcome</title><sec id="Sec1372"><title>Gu&#x000e9;lou Calypso<sup>1</sup>, Bourgogne Emmanuel<sup>1</sup>, Chevillard Lucie<sup>1</sup>, Deye Nicolas<sup>1</sup>, Voicu Sebastian<sup>1</sup>, Megarbane Bruno<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1373"><title><sup>1</sup>Paris, France; <sup>2</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Lariboisi&#x000e8;re Hospital, Paris, France</title><sec id="Sec1374"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Gu&#x000e9;lou Calypso - calypso.guelou@gmail.com</title><p id="Par1775"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-144</p><p id="Par1776"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Incidence of digoxin poisoning has decreased, mainly including accidental chronic digoxin overdose to date.

They are growing in importance as a source of nosocomial infections, especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). This leads to increased consumption of carbapenems. It is unclear whether patients colonised by E-ESBL in the digestive tract should be empirically treated by carbapenems when they develop intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia. The goal of our study was to identify risk factors associated with lower airway colonisation by E-BLSE among digestive carriers.</p><p id="Par1797"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We conducted a retrospective monocentric study in the ICU of a tertiary care university hospital from January 2012 until June 2014. Screening for E-ESBL by rectal swab and respiratory cultures was systematically done at admission then twice weekly until discharge. We included all patients with a positive rectal swab during their ICU stay. Exclusion criteria were an ICU stay of less than 48&#x000a0;h and known respiratory E-ESBL colonisation prior to ICU-admission.</p><p id="Par1798"><bold>Results:</bold> 243 patients were included. Median age was 63&#x000a0;years (48&#x02013;71) and 64% were male. Median Apache II score was 20 (15&#x02013;27) and median ICU length of stay was 8&#x000a0;days (5&#x02013;14). 65.8% of patients were mechanically ventilated and we observed a 31% in-hospital mortality rate. Most patients were colonised by rectal ESBL at admission (median delay between ICU admission and colonisation 1&#x000a0;day (0&#x02013;4.5)). The ESBL species were mostly E. Coli (151 isolates, 62%) followed by Klebsiella (48 isolates, 20%) and Enterobacter sp. (37 isolates, 15%). 19 patients acquired tracheal E-ESBL colonisation (7.8%) and 5 of them developed a pneumonia caused by E-ESBL. In univariate analysis, mechanical ventilation, higher APACHE-2 score and non-Coli species were associated with tracheal ESBL colonization (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05). In exploratory multivariate analysis, mechanical ventilation and non <italic>E. coli</italic> sp. were associated with tracheal ESBL colonisation. Interestingly, none of the fecal carriers of <italic>E. coli</italic> ESBL without mechanical ventilation developed tracheal colonization.</p><p id="Par1799"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Bronchial colonization by E-ESBL is rare among fecal carriers in the ICU. Mechanical ventilation and non-<italic>E. coli</italic> E-ESBL seem to be the main risk factors for tracheal colonization. Among carriers of <italic>E. coli</italic> ESBL not treated by mechanical ventilation and developing ICU-acquired pneumonia it seems reasonable not to cover them with carbapenems.

We aimed in this study to make an inventory of the consumption of the antibiotics in our unit especially for the ESKAPE pathogens and to define the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the patients.</p><p id="Par1802"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> we carried out a retrospective descriptive and analytical study, over a year involving all patients hospitalized in the medical intensive care unit of university teaching hospital Ibn Rushd Casablanca during the 2015. Data collection was based on a mining record.</p><p id="Par1803"><bold>Results:</bold> 190 patients received antibiotics. Its prescription incidence was 53.37%. The average length of hospitalisation was 18.45&#x000a0;days. Antibiotic therapy was started before admission in 42.10% of patients. After admission, 53.37% of patients received antibiotic therapy. Curative antibiotic therapy was probabilistic in 90.5% of cases based on clinical, biological, radiological and ecological arguments. 6.3% of initial prescriptions were directed to bacteriological results and 3.2% of initial prescriptions were prophylactic. The infection was predominantly respiratory infections (62.10%), but nosocomial infection accounted for 37.89%. Third generation cephalosporins represented the most frequently prescribed molecules (73.68% of cases) followed by quinolones and aminoglycosides. 41.6% of patients received monotherapy, while 58.4% of patients received a combination of antibiotics. The mean duration of curative antibiotic therapy was 5.67&#x000a0;days. The most frequently isolated seeds in the samples were Acinetobacter baumannii, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella pneumonia</italic>e.

All adult patients older than 18&#x000a0;years and hospitalized in our unit with a stay exceeding 48&#x000a0;h were included. MDR bacteria screening consisted of performing a series of swabs on admission and renewed weekly. The sites were&#x02014;nasal, cutaneous, rectal and urinary. Additional bacteriological samples were taken in presence of infectious signs. The group of true positives were those with a positive test (at least one MDR bacteria isolated in the series of samples) and having a documented NI to MDR bacteria.</p><p id="Par1818"><bold>Results:</bold> 112 screening tests were performed in 40 patients with a median age to 47&#x000a0;years, and 1.1 of sex ratio. 71 screening tests were positive isolating 142 MDR resulting in MDR bacteria colonized group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;71) versus non MDR bacteria colonized group (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41).

While ESBL-PE related infections rarely occur in patients without prior colonization, infections occurring among colonized patients may be due to other less resistant pathogens. In this view, it would be interesting to be able to predict, which colonized patients will actually develop ESBL-PE related infections, so as to control the increasing use of carbapenems that may jeopardize their efficacy in a near future. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for subsequent infection among ESBL-PE colonized patients.</p><p id="Par1822"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We performed a prospective study in a 16-bed ICU of a French universitary hospital. All patients with ESBL-PE colonization were considered. Rectal swabs were performed at admission, thereafter on a weekly basis and at ICU discharge. The following data were collected&#x02014;age, sex, severity scores, admission category (medical or surgical), underlying diseases, antibiotic exposure within 3&#x000a0;months before ICU admission, invasive procedures, type of ESBL-PE, and outcome.

The question as to when hygiene screening cultures (HS) should be performed to identify MDR-GNB colonized patients is still debated. In our medical ICU we perform a targeted screening of high-risk patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relevance of this screening policy.</p><p id="Par1827"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> We retrospectively analyzed (from January 2014 to April 2017) all cases of isolation of ESBL or carbapenemase producing Enterobacteriaceae in a previously naive patient during his her stay in our ICU, either by HS or clinical samples. Except for patient coming from known endemic area unit, hygiene screening was performed, when the clinician in charge of the patient felt it necessary.

The remaining 12 cases were more likely to be &#x0201c;real&#x0201d; false-negatives hygiene samples, because clinical samples (urines 6, respiratory samples, 4, blood cultures 2) were positive either before (1 to 7&#x000a0;days, 6 cases), concomitantly (3 cases) or not more than 3&#x000a0;days (1, 2 and 3&#x000a0;days, 3 cases) after hygiene screening.</p><p id="Par1829"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> For almost 40% of the new ESBL positive patients, no hygiene sample (rectal swab) had been performed. This raises questions about the fiability of targeted screening. Hygiene samples are negative in approximately 10% of patients with positive clinical samples.

In the intervention group, patients received 5 intravenous injections (40,000 units each) spaced 12&#x000a0;h apart during the first 48&#x000a0;h, started as soon as possible after resuscitation.

Each episode of hypotension is deleterious and can harm the recovery of renal function or other organs. TTE is a non-invasive hemodynamic assesment tool, already assessed in this indication with inconclusive results. The aim of the study is to define echocardiographic criteria for PT to IH.</p><p id="Par1847"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Prospective observational monocentric study in an intensive care unit. All sessions of IH were included and several sessions could be included per patient. The patients having an hemodynamic failure with a SOFA score&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;3 were excluded. A TTE was performed before the session. The PT was defined by&#x02014;hypotension, arrhythmia episode, need for volume replacement, to increase the dose of catecholamines, or to suspend the session. The clinical and echocardiographic parameters, selected according to the current literature, were compared for the tolerance to IH with Mann-Withney tests or Fisher exact tests.</p><p id="Par1848"><bold>Results:</bold> We included 41 sessions of IH in 9&#x000a0;months, 46% of which under mechanical ventilation. Only 15% of the patients had bad echogenicity. In 56% of the cases, the patient had a heart disease. The median SOFA score was 8 and the median planned depletion was 2&#x000a0;L. On these 3 parameters we found no differences between tolerant and intolerant patients to IH. There were 17 sessions of IH (46%) associated with PT. The following echocardiographic parameters were not significantly different in the 2 groups&#x02014;altered left ventricular ejection fraction, inferior vena cava collapsibility, ratio E A, ratio E Ea. The increase of left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral (LVOT VTI) after leg raising was significantly higher in intolerant patients (0.8 vs. 10.3%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02, see Figure below).<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figz_HTML" id="MO72"/>
</p><p id="Par1849"><bold>Discussion:</bold> The variation of the LVOT VTI is a criterion of preload dependence used to predict the response to volume expansion.

Our aim was to document peripheral estimates of Ea (EapSAP) at the bedside in critically ill patients, and to investigate the haemodynamic mechanisms responsible for Ea changes after fluid administration (FA).</p><p id="Par1859"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> In the validation study, carotid tonometry (Complior) was prospectively performed on 50 haemodynamically stable spontaneously breathing patients equipped with an arterial femoral (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;21) or radial (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;29) catheter. Ea was defined as the (0.9&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;cSAP) SV ratio, where cSAP was the central systolic arterial pressure directly measured from the calibrated carotid waveform. EapSAP was calculated as the (0.9 x peripheral systolic arterial pressure) SV ratio. SV was obtained by transpulmonary thermodilution or transthoracic echocardiography.

Heart rate variability (HRV) is a mean to evaluate cardiac effects of ANS activity and a relation between HRV and outcome has been proposed in various types of patients. While electrocardiographic HRV assessment seems to be the gold standard, we evaluated the feasibility of an automated HRV monitoring based on standard photoplethysmographic monitoring. This project is based on a prospective physiological tracing data-warehousing program (Rea STOC, clinicaltrials.gov # NCT02893462) that aims to record more than 1500 ICU patients over a 3-years period.</p><p id="Par1874"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Physiological tracings were recorded from the standard monitoring system (Intelliview MP70 Philips), using a dedicated network and extraction software (Synapse v1, LTSI INSERM U1099) that enables photoplethysmographic recordings from oximetry monitoring at a native resolution of 125&#x000a0;Hz. Raw data were subsequently stored on a dedicated local server, before anonymization and analysis. All consecutive patients were recorded for a 2-hours period during the 24-hours following ICU admission. All measurements were recorded with the patient laying supine, with a 30&#x000b0; bed head angulation. Physiological recordings were associated with metadata collection by a dedicated research assistant.HRV parameters defined in a previous study were derived using Kubios HRV premium (standard deviation of all normal RR intervals [SDNN], root-mean-square of difference of successive RR intervals [rMSSD], and RR triangular index) and frequency domain (power within low-frequency band [LF], and power within high-frequency band [HF]).</p><p id="Par1875"><bold>Results:</bold> 110 patients&#x02019; tracings were analyzed (72 male 38 female&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;age 61.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;13.8&#x000a0;yr).

Concerning norepinephrine, we collected the initial dose, the maximal dose, the first-line use, the delay of use, the total duration of use and the duration of maximal dose. Hemodynamical and respiratory parameters and associated treatments were collected at the introduction and at the maximal dose of norepinephrine.</p><p id="Par1905"><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred and ninety one patients were included, including 44.5% of preterm neonates.

At admission, delirium was found in 27% of elderly versus 11% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03), altered vigilance in 46 versus 21% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.007), stroke in 8 versus 1% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02), digestive hemorrhage in 19 versus 5% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02). Renal replacement therapy was required in 46% of elderly versus 27% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.047). Frequency of TTP, HUS and aHUS was similar beetween groups. TMA was more frequently associated with ongoing cancer and drug use in elderly (39 vs. 8%, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01 and 23 vs. 6%, p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.01, respectively). Gastro-intestinal bleeding during ICU occurred more often among elderly (35 vs. 15% (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.02)). ICU mortality rate was higher (19 vs. 7%, p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.049). No difference was found concerning plasma-exchange therapy, steroids use, and rescue treatments for refractory-TTP.</p><p id="Par1936"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Increased complication and mortality rates in the elderly group might be ascribed to more cardiovascular morbidity in this population. The association between TMA and ongoing cancer suggests a routine oncological workup among elderly.</p><p id="Par1937"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This study reports the clinical picture of TMAs in patients over-60-crowd.

Currently, it is unclear the impact of this type of poisoning in our country for lack of declarations. We propose in our work to study the epidemiological characteristics of fatal carbon monoxide intoxications collected in the forensic Pathology department of the university hospital in Sfax, Tunisia, to describe the different steps used in forensic diagnosis of fatal carbon monoxide intoxication and to propose preventive measures to reduce the rate of these intoxications.</p><p id="Par1967"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> It is a retrospective study of 29 cases of fatal carbon monoxide intoxications collected in the Forensic Pathology Department of the University Hospital in Sfax, Tunisia during 06&#x000a0;years (1 January 2011 to 31 December 2016). Commemoratives were collected from medical and police records. A forensic autopsy and a toxicological analysis were carried out in all cases.</p><p id="Par1968"><bold>Results:</bold> Fatal carbon monoxide intoxication is the leading cause of toxic death in Sfax during the period of our study. We notice a decrease in the incidence of this type of intoxication. The average age of deaths was 36&#x000a0;years and 2&#x000a0;months with male predominance. The peak frequency of intoxication was in cold season. The most frequent form of intoxication was accidental. The source of carbon monoxide was mainly the defective water heater often placed in poorly ventilated areas. The classic carmine red-color of lividity was found in the majority of cases. Myocardial distress, favored by hypoxia, has been reported in two subjects with a pathological coronary artery. The mean HbCO level was 51.59%. However, account must be taken of the survival time and the time elapsed between death and dosing of HbCO.

In our country, dihydropiridines are the most prescribed ones. Very few works have studied the hemodynamic profile of acute dihydropyridines poisoning either by invasive means (right cardiac catheterization, trans-pulmonary thermodilution) or non-invasive (cardiac ultrasound). In this perspective, we carried out this study whose main objective was to illustrate the different hemodynamic profiles of shocks induced by dihydropyridine CCB Poisoning.</p><p id="Par1982"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> It was an observational retrospective study spread over 12&#x000a0;months from 1st January 2016 to 31th December 2016 in a teaching toxicological ICU, including all patients admitted for acute dihydropyridine CCB poisoning, who presented a shock and underwent right hemodynamic exploration.</p><p id="Par1983"><bold>Results:</bold> During the study period, CCB poisoning accounted for 3.15% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24) of all the acute poisoinings requiring hospitalization in our Intensive Care Unit. Among them, 21 had taken dihydropyridine which represents 87.5%. Four women aged of 29 [21, 47] were eligible. All the exposures were single-drug. The dihydropyridines involved were amlodipine in 2 cases with a median value of supposed ingested dose (SID) of 297.5&#x000a0;mg and nicardipine in the other two ones, the median SID was 1000&#x000a0;mg. The delay of consultation was of 2.25&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;h after ingestion. Gastrointestinal decontamination was performed in one patient with activated charcoal. The 4 patients developed a shock within 3&#x000a0;h, treated by initial vascular filling on average 1000&#x000a0;ml of crystalloids, noradrenaline alone in 3 cases and with a combination of dobutamine in one patient. Other adjuvant treatments (high dose insulin, calcium salts) have been used in all patients. Their hemodynamic profile evaluation by right-handed catheterization Swan-Ganz was in favour of vasoplegia in 3 cases with median values of systemic vascular resistances (SVR) of 224 dynes.s.cm-5, of cardiac Output (CO) of 14 (L min), and of the arteriovenous oxygen difference of 4.76. The fourth patient&#x02019;s shock had mixed nature with SVR of 507 dynes.s.cm-5 and CO of 3.7 (L min). All patients were discharged from the ICU with a mean length of stay of 14&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="Par1984"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers poisoning exposes to the shock risk due to several mechanisms. The clinician must be warned to look for signs of severity and understand its mechanisms by using the hemodynamic study in order to improve its management.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1535"><title>P-185 Management of voluntary drug poisoning at Oran University Hospital</title><sec id="Sec1536"><title>Goulmane Mourad<sup>1</sup>, Alachaher Djamel<sup>1</sup>, Djebli Houria<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1537"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU d&#x02019;Oran,&#x000a0;Oran, Algeria</title><sec id="Sec1538"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Goulmane Mourad - m.goulmane@hotmail.com</title><p id="Par1985"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-185</p><p id="Par1986"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Voluntary drug intoxication (VDI) continues to be a major health problem in many developed and developing countries. In Algeria, this has become a worrying concern. Awareness-raising is launched to prevent the public from these dangers. VDI are intentional or rarely accidental and can be individual or collective and affect all age groups. The VDI represents the first reason for hospitalization in the Emergency Department University hospital of Oran.</p><p id="Par1987"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> In Algeria there is no national or regional register of voluntary intoxication. Knowledge of the causes of drug poisoning should therefore be extrapolated from foreign studies. To draw up an assessment of the IMVs, a retrospective study was carried out over the 2&#x000a0;years (2015&#x02013;2016). This survey consisted of collecting data on the nature of the drug, age, sex, major toxidromes, severe IMVs requiring hospitalization in ICU, mortality, E.T.C scores and GLASGO scores.</p><p id="Par1988"><bold>Results:</bold> 1650 cases of acute poisoning were collected, with a predominance in patients aged between 16 and 25, a percentage of 31.77%. In addition, most patients were female with 60.98%, a sex ratio of 1.56 with p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05. The main toxidromes were&#x02014;opioid syndrome in 27% of cases and anticholinergic syndrome in 23% of cases. ETC with a score of&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;9% accounted for 93% of patients. Severe VDI requiring resuscitation hospitalization were 8%.</p><p id="Par1989"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Acute poisoning remains high and steady in the Oran region and the under-25 age group represents the most affected category. Awareness campaigns must be launched throughout the year to better conserve and store medicines, phytosanitary products and other chemicals. Improved socio-economic conditions would help to reduce voluntary intoxication.</p><p>

Patient 1 presented with prolonged hypoglycemic coma, patient 2 with intracerebral hemorrhage, patient 3 with central and extra pontine myelinolysis, patient 4 with a brainstem hemorrhage. All these patients received full treatment in the ICU and had a 6-month follow-up. Physicians were provided with the four clinical vignettes including clinical history, brain imaging and other relevant exams (CSF, EEG,&#x02026;), evolution of symptoms within the first days of the ICU stay. They had to estimate 6-month outcome using modified Rankin scale (mRS) where a score from 0 to 3 was considered as a good outcome and 4 to 6 as a poor outcome.

</p><p id="Par2014"><bold>Discussion:</bold> French law is based on presumed consent. Despite this, it is noted that when patients had never expressed their opinion about OD (and therefore had not refused it), the opposition rate reached 43.5% and was comparable to the patients who had expressed themselves.</p><p id="Par2015"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In our study, factors related to refusal of OD are mainly related to the characteristics of the deceased (religion, culture, history of ethylism) and those of relatives (disagreement, presence of a spouse), but little to the way of doing the interview. However, there is a trend for less opposition when the interview is conducted during the day (between 8&#x02013;00 and 20&#x02013;00). On the other hand, when relatives first address the issue of OD, the opposition rate is lower.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1559"><title>P-191 Identification of power relations between medical and paramedical staff during withdrawal or limitation of care decision: a questionnaire study</title><sec id="Sec1560"><title>Piazza Sara<sup>1</sup>, De Montmollin Etienne<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1561"><title><sup>1</sup>Centre hospitalier de Saint-Denis,&#x000a0;Saint Denis, France</title><sec id="Sec1562"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Piazza Sara - piazza.sar@gmail.com</title><p id="Par2016"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-191</p><p id="Par2017"><bold>Introduction:</bold> French intensive care society guidelines and the Claes-Leonnetti Law recommend that intensive care teams organize collegiate and multidisciplinary discussions regarding limitation and withdrawal of care decisions.

Difficulties arise mainly in acute situations requiring intensive care that have not been anticipated and therefore, not adequately prepared and discussed. We hypothesized that non-admission of a patient to the ICU must occur in the following circumstances&#x02014;(1) with the patient&#x02019;s agreement, expressed either directly or through advance directives (AD), or as relayed by a surrogate or the family&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(2) according to a collegial decision-making process (if the patient is decisionally incapacitated)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;and (3) after seeking the opinion of an external consultant.

The decision not to admit the patient to the ICU was taken&#x02014;(1) during night duty for 19 patients (61%)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(2) by a senior physician in 100%, and (3) after clinical examination in 25 (80%). The main reasons justifying the decision not to admit to the ICU were&#x02014;(1) metastatic cancer in 8 patients (26%)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(2) total loss of autonomy in 8 (26%)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(3) severe cognitive impairment in 4 (13%)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(4) premorbid state in 1 (3%)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;(5) chronic organ failure for 2 (5%)&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;and (6) presence of AD (written or oral) specifying that the patient did not wish to be admitted to the ICU in 8 (26%). This study raises several points concerning the decision-making process for patients requiring intensive care. First, collegiality is observed in almost all situations of non-admission (97%). Second, an outside consultant was contacted in around 30% of cases. Third, 26% of patients had AD.

In critically ill patients, severe and persistent testosterone deficiency is very common after ICU admission. Administration of testosterone may induce skeletal muscle fiber hypertrophy and decreases protein breakdown. The aim of this work is to assess testosterone levels in critical ill patients and to evaluate the safety of testosterone gel administration.</p><p id="Par2049"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This is a single center study realized in a university ICU of 10 beds. Total testosterone levels were measured in critical ill men with at least one organ dysfunction with SOFA&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;3. The study drug was Androgel, a formulation of 1% testosterone in an alcohol-water gel, approved by the ANSM for treatment of hypogonadism in men. AndroGel was applied to the abdomen, shoulders or upper arms once a day at the same time to dry and intact skin during ICU stay. The daily dose was 75&#x000a0;mg in men and 25&#x000a0;mg in women daily. Patients with history of prostate or breast cancer or PSA&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;4&#x000a0;ng&#x000a0;ml were excluded.</p><p id="Par2050"><bold>Results:</bold> Total testosterone levels were measured in 19 men. Median length of stay at the time of measurement was 7&#x000a0;days in ICU and 11&#x000a0;days in the hospital. Plasma testosterone levels were low in all but 1 patient. Median testosterone level was 58&#x000a0;ng&#x000a0;dl (normal values 270&#x02013;780&#x000a0;ng&#x000a0;dl). Testosterone levels were not correlated with score SOFA or length of ICU stay. We found a moderate positif correlation between testosterone levels and length of hospital stay (r&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.5&#x000a0;=). Testosterone gel was administered in 12 men and in 6 women. In these 18 patients, the median score SOFA was 10, ICU death occurred in 3 patients (22% ICU mortality), median length of ventilation was 13&#x000a0;days and median length of stay in ICU 30&#x000a0;days. All patients received mechanical ventilation and vasoactive treatment. 9 patients needed renal replacement therapy. AndroGel was well tolerated. No ischemic cardiovascular events were described. There was no application site reaction or acne. Median length of testosterone gel administration was 12&#x000a0;days.</p><p id="Par2051"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Critical ill patients have low testosterone levels. Testosterone gel may be safely administered during the acute phase in ICU.

These units aim at receiving patients who need close monitoring, or present a risk of a potential organ failure without requiring substitution. The terms of the structural and staff organizations, clearly defined in 2006 by two Decrees and a Circular of application, have been described by Leclerc et al. (2008). The University Hospital of Lille is a pediatric center including several IteCUs in its pediatric hematology or gastrology departments, and more recently in its pediatric surgical department. Moreover, there are 4&#x02013;6 IteCU extra-beds within the 12&#x02013;14 bed pediatric intensive care unit (IveCU). The Hospital of Mayotte has no pediatric IveCU but a polyvalent one for adults, which receives children when necessary, as well as a 4 bed IteCU.

Each ICU ventilator was set in BTPS condition, at PEEP 12&#x000a0;cm&#x000a0;H<sub>2</sub>O and FIO2 0.21. Airway pressure and airflow (Hans-Rudolph pneumotachograph) were measured (Biopac M150) proximal to the lung model. For each ventilator a series of VT ranging from 100 to 280&#x000a0;ml was delivered for 10 breaths each, at 30 then at 15 breaths/min respiratory rate (RR). The relationship of VT measured to VT set was assessed by linear regression over the 5 ICU ventilators for each circuit&#x02014;RR combination.

In ARDS patients with EFL PEEP 10 improved oxygenation from intrinsic PEEP homogenization rather than lung recruitment. The NEP technique is no longer available. As EFL should reflect airway closure it is important to assess it. We described a new technique to assess EFL.</p><p id="Par2088"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Thirty-nine ARDS patients (6 mild, 32 moderate, 1 severe) were investigated at PEEP5 and15. They were intubated, mechanically ventilated (Evita XL) in volume controlled mode (tidal volume 5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;kg predicted body weight) in the semi-recumbent position. Airway pressure and flow measured proximal the endotracheal tube were continuously recorded (Biopac150). We measured respiratory mechanics by the occlusion technique at each PEEP and recruited lung volume between PEEP15 and 5 by using low flow inflation method associated with measurement in change in end-expiratory lung volume. For the latter, patient was manually disconnected at the end of baseline tidal inflation downstream pneumotachograph to atmosphere til zero flow, then reconnected at previous settings. EFL was assessed offline by superimposing flow-volume loops of disconnected and baseline breath. EFL was defined if no change in flow occurred over all or part of the disconnected expiration as compared to the baseline breath and no EFL (NFL) if any increase in flow during the expiration was present (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig62" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The percentage of the tidal volume involved in EFL was measured.<fig id="Fig62"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>The flow signal during disconnection in case of expiratory flow limitation (at the top) or no expiratory flow limitation (at the bottom)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Fig62_HTML" id="MO79"/></fig>
</p><p id="Par2089"><bold>Results:</bold> EFL was present in 7 patients (18%) over 80% of the tidal expiration.

Among these defects, a decreased HLA-DR expression on circulating monocytes was associated with a higher risk of nosocomial infections and higher mortality. Such immune alterations have also been observed in lung cells obtained from deceased patients. We aimed to compare phenotypic and functional characteristics of monocytes from ARDS and controls in blood and lung compartments.</p><p id="Par2093"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This is a prospective single center study. Patients with pneumonia and moderate severe ARDS admitted to the ICU (February-May 2017) were included. Immunosuppressed patients were excluded. The control group consisted in ARDS-free patients having no lung infection or immunosuppression status. Monocytes from peripheral blood and broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were collected within 48&#x000a0;h of intubation and phenotyped (HLA-DR and PD-L1 expressions). Phagocytosis and TNFa&#x000a0;intracellular synthesis, after <italic>E. coli</italic> lipopolysaccharide priming, were assessed in vitro. All analyzes were performed using flow cytometry. Results were expressed as positive cells ratio and mean florescence intensity.</p><p id="Par2094"><bold>Results:</bold> Six ARDS patients and five controls were included. All patient had septic shock upon ICU admission. SAPS II and SOFA scores were 61 [44&#x02013;71] and 12 [9&#x02013;14], the PaO2 FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio was 97 [67&#x02013;125] mmHg. Five patients had a bacterial pneumonia and one had a viral pneumonia. HLA-DR and PD-L1 expressions were higher on alveolar than on blood monocytes in both ARDS patients and controls (Figure). Yet, HLA-DR expression on alveolar monocytes was higher in controls compared to ARDS patients (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.004). Circulating monocytes had a higher phagocytic activity than alveolar monocytes (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001), but no significant difference was observed between ARDS patients and controls. An LPS challenge increased the phagocytic activity of monocytes in controls (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.03) but not in ARDS monocytes (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.88). TNF-&#x003b1; intracellular synthesis was increased after LPS exposure in circulating and alveolar monocytes of controls (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05) but only tended to do so in ARDS (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.08).<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figae_HTML" id="MO80"/>
</p><p id="Par2095"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Differences in the phenotype of alveolar and circulating monocytes were observed in ARDS but also in controls, suggesting a physiological lung blood gradient in the expression of these biomarkers. Yet, HLA-DR expression on alveolar monocytes was lower in ARDS than in controls, consistent with sepsis-induced immunosuppression at the alveolar level. Functional differences observed between ARDS and controls suggested a tolerogenic profile of ARDS monocytes.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1619"><title>P-206 Comparison of two strategies of oropharyngeal and tracheal suctioning in mechanically ventilated patients (AMYLASPI): a pilot study</title><sec id="Sec1620"><title>Griton Marion<sup>1</sup>, Bedel Aur&#x000e9;lie<sup>1</sup>, Clouzeau Benjamin<sup>1</sup>, Vargas Frederic<sup>1</sup>, Hilbert Gilles<sup>1</sup>, Gruson Didier<sup>1</sup>, Boyer Alexandre<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1621"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU Bordeaux,&#x000a0;Bordeaux, France</title><sec id="Sec1622"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Griton Marion - marion.griton@chu-bordeaux.fr</title><p id="Par2096"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-206</p><p id="Par2097"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Despite their recommendation in the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia, oral care is not still clearly standardized. It generally includes a time for oropharyngeal and tracheal suctions which can induce a cough reflex in non-paralyzed patients leading to the mobilization of the endotracheal tube and a consecutively increased risk of tracheal microaspirations. During the oral care procedure, drainage of subglottic secretions at particular times before oro-tracheal suctions is expected to reduce microaspiration. The aim of this study is to assess whether this &#x0201c;optimized&#x0201d; oral care including subglottic drainage can reduce microaspirations.</p><p id="Par2098"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This is an open prospective study, including ICU ventilated patients.

The amylase enzymatic activity has been measured in O, T, SG1 and SG2 suctions as a surrogate for the oropharyngeal content. If present in T suctions, it defines microaspiration. Since the amylase O content is not similar from a patient to another, the primary outcome was the median amylaseT O ratio after routine versus optimized oral care.</p><p id="Par2099"><bold>Results:</bold> After informed consent, 24 patients were included. 21 were analyzed due to incomplete follow-up in 3 patients.

In this pilot study with a limited sample of patients, a trend in the reduction of microaspirations was observed when subglottic suctions were interleaved between oral and tracheal suctions. An increased sample power could show more significant results, but we cannot eliminate that this weak effect could also be due to the inability of subglottic suctions to prevent microaspiration of the oral content. The study has been founded by Teleflex.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1623"><title>P-207 Safety and feasibility of extra corporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO2R) in ARDS and non ARDS patients</title><sec id="Sec1624"><title>Monet Cl&#x000e9;ment<sup>1</sup>, Monnin Marion<sup>1</sup>, De Jong Audrey<sup>1</sup>, Prades Albert<sup>1</sup>, Conseil Matthieu<sup>1</sup>, Chanques Gerald<sup>1</sup>, Carr Julie<sup>1</sup>, Belafia Fouad<sup>1</sup>, Jaber Samir<sup>1</sup></title><sec id="Sec1625"><title><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Saint Eloi, Montpellier, France</title><sec id="Sec1626"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Monet Cl&#x000e9;ment - clemen.t@hotmail.fr</title><p id="Par2101"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-207</p><p id="Par2102"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Although necessary, mechanical ventilation can lead to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) even when using protective ventilation strategies that combine low tidal volume (Vt)(6&#x000a0;ml&#x000a0;kg predicted body weight) and plateau pressure (Pplat)&#x000a0;&#x0003c;=&#x000a0;30cmH20.

In 2002, we changed our surgical antibioprophylaxis protocol from cefamandole to amoxicillin-clavulanate and observed a significant decrease of POP incidence and mortality. In 2012, we additionally implemented in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) an antimicrobial stewardship program based on a local antimicrobial guideline and a weekly multidisciplinary review of all antibiotic therapies by RICU physicians, infectious diseases specialists and microbiologists. Our objectives were to describe our current epidemiology of severe POP and to assess the quality of antibiotic prescriptions.</p><p id="Par2135"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> All patients with severe POP occurring within 30&#x000a0;days after lung resection between January 2013 and December 2015 were included. We collected data on clinical presentation, results of microbiological investigations, antibiotic regimen and outcomes. The quality of antibiotic use was assessed using indicators previously validated in the literature.</p><p id="Par2136"><bold>Results:</bold> Over 1555 patients who underwent major lung resection in our center, 91 matched criteria for severe POP and were included. Most were males (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;71, 78%). The median age was 69&#x000a0;years (minimum&#x02014;42&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;maximum&#x02014;84). Most patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;59, 65%) and 18 (20%) a history of non-pulmonary cancer. The resection consisted in lobectomy in 59% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;54). The median length of stay in RICU was 12&#x000a0;days (1&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;90), and 30-day mortality was 9% (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;8). Respiratory microbiological samples were obtained in all patients, in most cases invasively per bronchoscopy (74%). Microorganisms were cultured at a significant level in 66 (73%) patients. Predominant species were Enterobacteriacae (58%), Haemophilus influenzae (14%), Staphylococcus aureus (11%) and <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (10%). Microorganisms were sensitive to third generation cephalosporins in 52 (79%) and to piperacillin-tazobactam in 57 (86%). In patients treated empirically, antibiotics were prescribed according to the guideline in 80% (69 86). In documented POP, empiric antibiotics were active against documented micro-organisms in 53 62 (86%), and were correctly changed to pathogen-directed therapy in 46 62 (74%). The median duration of antibiotics was of 7&#x000a0;days (2&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;21).</p><p id="Par2137"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Ten years after implementation of amoxicillin-clavulanate as surgical antibioprophylaxis, the proportion of Enterobacteriacae increased. The 30-day postoperative mortality rate remained below 10%. We report high adherence to the guideline for the choice of empirical therapy and treatment duration. The rate of de-escalation to pathogen-directed therapy could however be improved considering the high rate of bacteriologically-documented POP.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1651"><title>P-214 Impact of an antibiotic stewardship program on the epidemiology of infection and colonization with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> in ICU</title><sec id="Sec1652"><title>Adrien Vladimir<sup>1</sup>, Rollin Nathalie<sup>2</sup>, Sy Oumar<sup>2</sup>, Iordache Laura<sup>2</sup>, Tebano Gianpietro<sup>2</sup>, Pitsch Aur&#x000e9;lia<sup>2</sup>, Vinsonneau Christophe, Mehran Monchi<sup>2</sup>, Jochmans Sebastien<sup>2</sup>, Diamantis Sylvain<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1653"><title><sup>1</sup>10 rue Riquet,&#x000a0;Paris, France; <sup>2</sup>CH de Melun, France</title><sec id="Sec1654"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Adrien Vladimir - vladimir.adrien@free.fr</title><p id="Par2138"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-214</p><p id="Par2139"><bold>Introduction:</bold> We describe the epidemiology of patients that had a microbiological sample positive with <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PA) during their stay in ICU and the impact of an antimicrobial stewardship program, based on the interaction with an infectious disease&#x02019;s specialist within the unit, aiming in reducing the use of some antibiotic classes (C3G, carbapenems and fluoroquinolones).</p><p id="Par2140"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> Retrospective analysis of medical files in the ICU unit of a general hospital over a 8-year period (2007&#x02013;2014), of all hospitalized patients that had a positive sample with PA within their stay.

In 2011, a French national warning plan was created to manage the use of antibiotics. It advocates monitoring of the prescription of antibiotics and the implementation of measures to assess professional practices. The great majority of guidelines concerning the duration of antibiotic therapy in community-acquired peritonitis are based on studies with low level of evidence. The objective of this study is to evaluate the implementation of a Standardized Operational Report (SOR) with a local antibiotic protocol in the management of community-acquired peritonitis at our institution.</p><p id="Par2145"><bold>Patients and methods:</bold> This is a monocentric, prospective cohort study&#x02014;before and after the establishment of the SOR. The primary endpoint is duration of antibiotic therapy. Secondary endpoints are length of hospitalization, infectious complications, mortality, and changes in local bacterial ecology. We have also evaluated retrospectively these different criteria on cohort was constituted since 2005.</p><p id="Par2146"><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 205 patients were enrolled from January 2011 to June 2013 and 231 patients from May 2014 to May 2016. The duration of antibiotic therapy was decreased by 7 to 3&#x000a0;days in localized peritonitis (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) and 9 to 7&#x000a0;days in generalized peritonitis (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) (Figure). However, the compliance to the protocol was only 66%, which leads to an increase in the duration of antibiotic therapy and hospital stay when not used (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). The hospital stay decreased from 7 to 4&#x000a0;days in the localized peritonitis (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001). Amoxicillin clavulanic acid (AMC) is the most used antibiotic with an efficiency of 77%. There was no impact on morbidity and mortality when AMC was inadequate. The bacterial ecology was not modified, the rate of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing enterobacteria (ESBLE) was 3%.<graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="13613_2017_345_Figaf_HTML" id="MO84"/>
</p><p id="Par2147"><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The use of a standardized antibiotic protocol reduced antibiotic therapy duration and hospital stay, particularly in localized peritonitis despite incomplete compliance to the protocol. To achieve full compliance, we need to continue the training of different physicians and continue the spread of the protocol.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec1659"><title>P-216 Severe meningitis-Epidemiological data and prognostic factors</title><sec id="Sec1660"><title>Ezzouine Hanane<sup>1</sup>, Mountassir Chorouk<sup>2</sup>, Sghier Zineb<sup>2</sup>, Benslama Abdellatif<sup>2</sup></title><sec id="Sec1661"><title><sup>1</sup>CHU IBN Rchod,&#x000a0;Casablanca, Morocco; <sup>2</sup>University Hassan II, Casablanca, Morocco</title><sec id="Sec1662"><title><bold>Correspondence:</bold> Ezzouine Hanane - ezzouinehanane@yahoo.fr</title><p id="Par2148"><italic>Annals of Intensive Care</italic> 2018, <bold>8(Suppl 1):</bold>P-216</p><p id="Par2149"><bold>Introduction:</bold> Bacterial meningitis is an important public health problem because of its frequency and severity.

</p><p id="Par2188"><bold>Discussion:</bold> Several potential explanations could be provided for the absence of negative impact on mortality of hyperoxemia. First, the definition used for hyperoxemia could be debated, as no consensus exists. However, the definition used in our study was rather stringent and the mean daily time spent with hyperoxemia was in line with that reported by studies. Second, the impact of hyperoxemia on mortality could have been confounded by a large number of patients included with pulmonary lesions at admission.

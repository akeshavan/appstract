These impairments are experienced at home, at school, and with friends. Functional imaging studies show that ADHD behaviour and impairments in executive functions (EFs) are mirrored by aberrant neurophysiological functioning. Moreover, several studies show that ADHD behaviour, impairments in EFs, and a lack of self-control contribute to poor school performance. Non-pharmacological interventions such as neurofeedback training (NFT), for instance, aim at improving neurophysiological and neuropsychological functioning as well as behaviour. Consequently, NFT is expected to improve school performance, EFs, and self-control in children with ADHD. Generalization of acquired self-regulation skills from laboratory to real life is crucial for a transfer to everyday situations and is hypothesized to be facilitated via training using virtual reality (VR) environments. Consequently, experiencing NFT in VR is expected to yield greater effects than training in two dimensions (2D).Methods/designNinety children with a clinical diagnosis of ADHD will be included in the study. Participants may be medicated or unmedicated. After random assignation to one of three conditions, all participants receive 15 training sessions of either near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)-based NFT in VR, NIRS-based NFT in 2D, or electromyogram-based biofeedback training in VR. ADHD symptoms, self-control, EF, health-related quality of life, school performance, and motor activity measured via parent, teacher, and child reports or objectively will be assessed before and after the intervention and at a 6 months follow-up. Furthermore, we are interested in parents’ expectations about the training’s effects.DiscussionThis is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating the efficacy of NFT for children with ADHD in a VR compared to a 2D environment. Furthermore, this study will contribute to the discussion about the efficacy and specific and unspecific effects of NFTs in children with ADHD. In addition to commonly assessed variables such as ADHD symptoms, NIRS and behavioural data obtained in EF measures, health-related quality of life, and parents’ expectations about the intervention’s effects, this study will investigate the effects on self-control, school performance, and motor activity.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02572180.

One of the principal investigators of this study who is only occasionally involved in training and testing participants executes the randomization. A block randomization procedure is applied, and balancing the conditions for age, gender, and ADHD medication stratifies the randomization.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Interventions</title><p>Two conditions involve 15 sessions of a NIRS-based NFT, one in a VR classroom setting and one in a 2D classroom setting to control for specific effects of trainings in VR and 2D. The third condition involves an EMG-based BFT in VR and constitutes a control condition that allows the evaluation of effects that are uniquely attributable to the NFT itself.</p><p>Every training session lasts approximately 60–70 min including a preparation phase at the beginning (20 min), in which the NIRS cap and optodes are fitted to the head, or the EMG electrodes are placed on both musculi supraspinatus and both mastoids. For the participants in the VR classroom setting, the head-mounted display (HMD) is mounted. The training sessions also include the NFT or BFT (45 min) and a training phase with stimulus cards at the end of the training sessions 6–15 (5 min). The stimulus cards present a screenshot of the 2D screen. Within the laboratory setting, these cards are introduced as cue stimuli associated with brain activation or increased muscular activity of the musculi supraspinatus as learned during the NFT or BFT. When employed at home, they are thought to facilitate activation and to establish an association between, for instance, doing homework and brain or muscle activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>Every training session with NIRS-based NFT or EMG-based BFT consists of three blocks, of which the first and the second are with continuous performance feedback (feedback condition). In the third block, no contingent performance feedback is provided (transfer condition), which is thought to foster generalization of acquired self-regulation skills to real-life situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. For the NIRS-based NFT, the first and the second blocks consist of 12 trials, the third of 8. Each trial starts with an active phase of 30 s in which the respective endogenous parameter, that is oxy-Hb in the bilateral dlPFC for NIRS-based NFT, should be regulated and is followed by a resting phase of 20 s at the end. For the EMG-based BFT, the first and the second block consist of 24 trials; the third block consists of 16 trials. Each trial starts with an active phase of 15 s in which muscular activity of the musculi supraspinatus should be regulated and is followed by a resting phase of 10 s. Durations of active and resting phases in NIRS-based NFT and EMG-based BFT conditions vary due to different response times of the respective endogenous parameters towards the beginning of self-regulation processes employed by the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Among the conditions, the amounts of trials are varied in order to obtain an equal total training duration for all conditions.</p><p>Lighting in the VR and 2D classroom provides the feedback. For the NIRS-based NFT, lighting increases with increasing activity in the bilateral dlPFC, i.e. increasing oxy-Hb, and decreases with decreasing activity, i.e. decreasing oxy-Hb. Lighting for the EMG-based BFT increases with increasing muscular activity in the right musculus supraspinatus compared to the left and decreases with increasing activity in the left musculus supraspinatus compared to the right.</p><p>During the first eight training sessions, the training follows a protocol with 50% activation and 50% deactivation trials. For the second half of the training sessions, the protocol changes to 80% activation and 20% deactivation trials. At the beginning of each trial, an arrow appearing on the blackboard of the VR or 2D classroom pointing upwards indicates an activation trial, while an arrow pointing downwards indicates a deactivation trial.</p><p>After eight training sessions, participants have a break of 2 to 3 weeks that should further support transfer to real-life settings by using stimulus cards with screenshots of the training setting. The stimulus cards show the image of the classroom that participants see during the training with the arrow pointing upwards and will be introduced in the laboratory setting at the end of training session numbers 6, 7, and 8. Participants are instructed to look at the cards, employ activation strategies they learned during the training, and imagine increasing the lighting five to six times. After this activation task, they solve a riddle appropriate for their age and knowledge. For the break, participants are instructed to practice activation at home at least once per day prior to a situation that requires sustained attention, e.g. doing homework. For the rest of the training sessions, participants are asked to continue practicing activation at home. Furthermore, they still practice with the cards at the end of every training session. The 2D and VR classroom is shown in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Positive reinforcement</title><p>In both NFT and BFT, an animated teacher in the VR or 2D classroom provides reinforcement via positive auditory feedback if the participant performed successfully in the past trial. In addition, smileys appear on the blackboard of the classroom to provide positive reinforcement at the end of every successful trial. Success is calculated as follows. For the NIRS-based NFT, a baseline is calculated as the average oxy-Hb signal from the eight dlPFC channels (four on the left and four on the right hemisphere) in the last 5 s before the start of each trial. For the EMG-based BFT, the baseline is calculated as the average normalized EMG output (right musculus supraspinatus EMG output minus left musculus supraspinatus EMG output) in the last second before the start of each trial. Reinforcement is provided with one smiley when the participant has spent 60–69% of the time of the second half of the trial on the required side of the baseline. For the NIRS-based NFT, below the baseline is a decrease in the oxy-Hb signal from the eight dlPFC channels, and above is an increase in the oxy-Hb signal from the eight dlPFC channels. For the EMG-based BFT, below the baseline is an increase in the activity in the left musculus supraspinatus compared to the right, and above is an increase in the activity in the right musculus supraspinatus compared to the left. Analogously, the participant receives two smileys with 70–79% and three smileys with at least 80% of the second half of the trial spent in the required direction. Furthermore, reinforcement for the second block changes adaptively with the performance in the first block. If the participant scored between 40 and 60% success rate in the first block, the second block will remain exactly like the first. If the participant achieves lower than a 40% success rate, the threshold will decrease to .8 standard deviations (<italic>SD</italic>) in either direction relative to the baseline, so that fluctuations in the light are more sensitive to performance. In addition, the threshold for receiving smileys would decrease to 50%, 60%, and 70% of the time that must be spent on the required side of the baseline, for one, two, or three smileys, respectively. If the participant scores higher than a 60% success rate in the first block, the threshold increases to 1.2 <italic>SD</italic> above and below the baseline, hence making changes in the lighting, requiring more relative activation or deactivation. In addition, the baseline is artificially augmented to be .1 <italic>SD</italic> above or below the calculated baseline. Consequently, in order to receive smileys, the participant has to maintain a stronger activation or deactivation than before. The third block will be calculated in the same way as the second.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>The VR and 2D classroom</title><p>In the VR and 2D classroom, every participant is seated at a virtual table in the second row of a primary school classroom (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.). Other pupils surround him/her, and a teacher sits in the front of the classroom at a desk. Visual, auditory, and mixed distractors such as, for instance, paper planes flying through the room, fellow students whispering, or people knocking on the door will be randomized to occur in 50% of all trials. Their appearance is balanced between trials and sessions, and the distractors appear with a distance of at least 60 s between two distractors.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Token system</title><p>Children are rewarded for their participation. At the beginning of the study, they receive a sticker album and one sticker per test or training session in the course of the study.

It consists of five subtests on substitutions, mazes, classifications, similarities, and matrices. The test can be applied in a short and a long form that differ in testing time only, but not in the amount of subtests applied. The short form will be used in this study. Reliability scores for the subtests vary between <italic>r</italic> = .75 and <italic>r</italic> = .90, and reliability for the short form is reported to be <italic>r</italic> = .94. Retest reliability with a second measurement after 2.5 months is <italic>r</italic> = .90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. For children aged 8 years and 5 months and older, the Culture Fair Intelligence Test 20-R (CFT 20-R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] is used. The CFT 20-R is a non-verbal intelligence test consisting of two parts, each containing four identically constructed subtests on completing series, classifications, matrices, and topological reasoning. In this study, the test is applied in its short version, which consists of only the first of the two parts. The reliability of the CFT 20-R is <italic>r</italic> = .92 for the short version of the test. The retest reliability is adequate, with <italic>r</italic> = .85 after 2 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Hence, both tests show adequate psychometric properties to measure intelligence in the study sample.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Conners 3rd Edition (Conners 3) - German translation</title><p>The German long versions of the Conners 3 for parents (C3-P) and teachers (C3-T) consist of 108 items for parents and 112 items for teachers. The Conners 3 tools assess ADHD symptoms but also learning problems, EF, peer relationships, and aggression/defiance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Furthermore, the questionnaires contain screener items for anxiety and depression. Both versions of the Conners 3 have adequate psychometric properties for teachers and parents with good internal consistency for most of the scales (Cronbach’s α &gt; .85) and acceptable values for the remaining scales (Cronbach’s α &gt; .70). Test-retest reliabilities are also good, with average values of about <italic>r</italic> = .85. Consequently, the Conners 3 in its German version seems to be appropriate to assess the effects of the intervention administered in this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire</title><p>The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) consists of 25 items and assesses behavioural strengths and difficulties of children on five scales: prosocial behaviour, hyperactivity, emotional problems, peer relationships, and conduct problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Different versions for teachers and parents are available and are used in this study. The factorial structure of the original English questionnaires was also found for the German translations (SDQ-Deu) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Psychometric properties for the German versions are good, with high internal consistency for the whole questionnaire (Cronbach’s α = .82) and at least acceptable scores for the subscales (Cronbach’s α between .58 and .76). The retest reliability is specified with <italic>r</italic> = .62 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>]. Consequently, the SDQ-Deu is an appropriate measure to assess effects of the therapeutic intervention of this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>KINDL-R</title><p>The KINDL-R questionnaires assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) via self-report and parent rating on six scales: physical and mental well-being, self-esteem, family, friends, and functional capability in daily life at school. In this study, the Kid-KINDL-R for children aged 7–13, as well as the Kiddo-Kindl-R for parents of children aged 7–13, are applied. Psychometric quality and overall consistency of the parent questionnaire are good, with Cronbach’s α = .85 for the total scales and values ranging between α = .63 and α = .71 for the subscales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Likewise, psychometric quality of the self-report questionnaire for children is good, with Cronbach’s α = .82 for the total scales and values between α = .54 and α = .73 for the subscales.

With a retest reliability of <italic>r</italic> = .82, the psychometric quality is good. Adding to the parent report, we adapted the questionnaire to a self-report measure that can be used with children. Piloting the adapted version of the self-report questionnaire for children, we confirmed its psychometric quality, as internal consistency was high, with Cronbach’s α = .80.

Data from a NIRS measurement are recorded while the participant completes this task to assess differences in cortical brain activation resulting from the therapy. The VFT assesses semantic and phonetic fluency as well as semantic memory and consists of three blocks with three different tasks in every block. Every task is 30 s long and is followed by a resting phase of 30 s. In the first task (phonetic fluency), participants are instructed to name nouns beginning with a given letter. They are instructed not to name proper names and they are not allowed to name a series of compound words in which one of two words always remains the same such as in bird bone, bird bath, bird call, for instance. One of the following sets of letters is randomly assigned to each of the three measurements: E, P, G, A, F, M, and K, H, R. Furthermore, the sequence of the letters is randomized to prevent sequence effects. The difficulty of finding nouns beginning with a specific letter is balanced between the groups. For the second task (semantic memory), that is, the control task, participants are instructed to name the days of the week starting with Monday, and to name approximately one day per second. In the third task (semantic fluency), participants are instructed to name nouns belonging to a given category. To each measurement, one group of categories, either ‘animals, professions, drinks’, ‘colours, clothes, hobbies’, or ‘fruits, sports, toys’, is assigned randomly. The sequence of the categories is randomized, and the difficulty of the categories is balanced between the sets of words. On the behavioural level, reproducibility of the VFT is good, with <italic>r</italic> = .70 within a 3-week time interval [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Reproducibility of brain activity as measured with fNIRS was acceptable, with <italic>r</italic> = .50 at a single subject level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>]. Hence, the VFT, as it is used in this study, can be expected to be an appropriate instrument to measure semantic and phonetic fluency as well as semantic memory and corresponding task-related brain activity in the study sample.</p></sec><sec id="FPar5"><title>n-back task</title><p>The <italic>n</italic>-back task used in this study was developed in the research group Psychophysiology and Optical Imaging at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University of Tübingen. The task assesses working memory and consists of three different conditions: a 0-back, a 1-back, and a 2-back task. The tasks are presented to the participants in nine blocks, i.e. three blocks per condition containing 15 trials each, with a 20-s resting phase between active blocks. The stimulus duration is set to 300 ms, and the ISI to 1700 ms. In the 0-back task, participants are instructed to press the space bar as quickly as possible whenever they see a certain stimulus. In the 1-back task, they should respond with the space bar when any stimulus appears twice in a row. In the 2-back task, participants are instructed to press the space bar as quickly as possible whenever the current stimulus and the second last are the same. Target stimuli always constitute 4 out of the 15 presented stimuli in each block, and blocks are presented in a randomized order. In order to construct an age-appropriate version of the <italic>n</italic>-back task, stimuli are in image form, i.e. a moon, ball, or house. Before the actual test begins, participants practice every condition. The conditions used for testing contain different symbols than the ones used in the actual test. Data from a NIRS and an EEG measurement are recorded while the participant accomplishes this task to assess differences in cortical brain activation resulting from the therapy.</p></sec><sec id="FPar6"><title>Go/NoGo task</title><p>The Go/NoGo task used in this study was adapted to pictorial form from a version developed by the research group of Psychophysiology and Optical Imaging at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the University of Tübingen. The task assesses response inhibition and consists of eight blocks with 16 trials each. The ISI is fixed to 1150 ms, and all stimuli are presented for 350 ms. Four of the eight blocks consist of go-trials only; hence, participants are instructed to press the space bar as quickly as possible whenever they see a stimulus, i.e. randomly one of three different pictures, on the computer screen. The other four blocks are designed with 12 go- as well as 4 no-go-trials. Participants are instructed to press the space bar as quickly as possible whenever they see a go-stimulus, but to inhibit the reaction when a no-go-stimulus, i.e. a fork, appears on the screen. Blocks with only go-trials and blocks consisting of mixed trials follow each other in an alternating order, separated by a resting block of 30 s. Data from a NIRS and an EEG measurement are recorded while the participant accomplishes this task to assess differences in cortical brain activation resulting from the therapy.</p></sec><sec id="FPar7"><title>Matrix span task (WISC-IV)</title><p>The matrix span task, taken from the WISC-IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], assesses general cognitive abilities. The reliability of the matrix span task is reported to be <italic>r</italic> = .89 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>]; hence, it is an appropriate instrument to measure general cognitive abilities in the study sample.</p></sec><sec id="FPar8"><title>Sustained attention</title><p>The Conner’s Continuous Performance Test (CPT) from PEBL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] is used to assess sustained attention and response inhibition. This test presents 360 letters with a size of one inch to the participant one at a time on a computer screen. The letters are presented in 18 blocks with 20 letters each, and the blocks follow each other consecutively. The duration of the presentation of a letter is approximately 250 ms, while the ISI varies between 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 s. Within every triplet of blocks, the length of the ISIs is randomly distributed. Participants are instructed to always press the space bar as quickly as possible as soon as a letter appears. However, when the letter X appears, the space bar must not be pressed. The relative occurrence of an X, which remains constant across all blocks and triplets, is fixed at 10%; hence, in 90% of all letters presented, it is any letter but an X. The test-retest reliability of the Conner’s CPT is good, with values ranging between <italic>r</italic> = .55 and <italic>r</italic> = .84 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>]. Consequently, the Conner’s CPT is an appropriate test to measure sustained attention as well as response inhibition in the study sample.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Academic performance</title><sec id="FPar9"><title>Mathematics</title><p>The Lernverlaufsdiagnostik Mathematik für zweite bis vierte Klassen (LVD-M 2–4) assesses math performance in German primary schoolchildren from Grades 2–4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>].

Reliability has been estimated and ranges between <italic>r</italic> = .79 and <italic>r</italic> = .92 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. In correlation analyses with other German math tests such as the DEMAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">69</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>], validity has been demonstrated. Hence, this test can reliably assess math performance in the study sample.</p></sec><sec id="FPar10"><title>Reading and writing</title><p>The Lese- und Rechtschreibtest (SLRT-II), an advanced version of the Salzburger Lese- und Rechtschreibtest (SLRT), is used to assess reading and writing skills in schoolchildren from Grades 1 to 5 (1–6 for the subtest for reading). Two parallel versions are available. The reliability coefficients for the parallel tests for reading skills range between <italic>r</italic> = .90 and <italic>r</italic> = .98. For the tests of writing skills, the interrater reliability is very high, with <italic>r</italic> = .998. The test-retest reliability for the writing test is between <italic>r</italic> = .80 and <italic>r</italic> = .97 with the second measurement taken 5 weeks after the first. Parallel test reliabilities range between <italic>r</italic> = .69 and <italic>r</italic> = .85 for Grades 1–4. Hence, both tests show good quality criteria and can be applied in this study.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Neurophysiological and other physiological measures</title><sec id="FPar11"><title>Electroencephalogram (EEG)</title><p>EEG data are collected using 22 EEG channels positioned according to the international 10–20 system. Two channels of the actiCap system (Brain Products GmbH, Germany) are used to detect horizontal eye movements and are attached 1.5 cm lateral to the outer canthus of both eyes. One additional electrode is used to detect vertical eye movement and is attached 1.5 cm below the middle of the right lower eyelid.</p></sec><sec id="FPar12"><title>Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)</title><p>NIRS is an optical imaging technique examining the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) response of brain tissue. Light from the near-infrared spectrum (700–1000 nm wavelength) can penetrate the skull and is mainly absorbed by the two chromophores oxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb) and deoxygenated haemoglobin (deoxy-Hb). As the two chromophores differ in their absorption maxima, variations of the concentration of both types in the brain tissue can be derived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>]. Due to neurovascular coupling, changes in concentration of oxy- and deoxy-Hb occur in response to cortical activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. Hence, oxy- and deoxy-Hb provide information about brain activity in respective areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In the present study, data are acquired with the ETG-4000 Optical Topography System (Hitachi Medical Co., Japan), which is a continuous wave system working with two different wavelengths (695 ± 20 and 830 ± 20 nm) and a temporal resolution of 10 Hz, using a 44-channel array. Relative changes of absorbed near-infrared light are transformed into concentration changes of oxy-Hb and deoxy-Hb by means of a modified Beer-Lambert law.</p><p>The 28 NIRS optodes (14 light sources (emitters), 14 detectors) are arranged in a combined NIRS/EEG cap designed to function with the Oculus Rift HMD Development Kit 2. The caps are individually localized by the EEG channels FCz and Cz according to the 10–20 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. In order to assign NIRS channels that are situated in between adjacent pairs of emitters and detectors to their corresponding cortical regions, a spatial registration method of NIRS channels is applied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>]. In order to normalize the combined EEG/NIRS caps for children aged 6–10, we used the neuronavigation data of a 9-year-old girl normalized with the average brain from this age range, taken from the Template-O-Matic project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. A cap for a combined EEG/NIRS measurement from a previous study was placed on the girl's head. Using neuronavigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>], optode and channel positions together with their corresponding cortical projection points on the head were obtained. The resulting coordinates from the neuronavigation were transferred to the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space. Mapped on a virtual brain template, caps for combined EEG/NIRS measurements were customized with maximum coverage of the bilateral dlPFC (Brodmann areas 9, 46) that are used as feedback channels in the NIRS-based NFT of this study. See Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> for the alignment of the NIRS channels on the cortex surface. Hence, seven emitter and seven detector optodes are spread over prefrontal, central, temporal, and parietal areas of each hemisphere. The emitter-detector distance is 3 cm; we also employ one temporal channel on each hemisphere with a short-optode distance of 1 cm that can be used in later analysis for artefact removal (muscle artefacts as related to biting, for instance, as well as skin perfusion artefacts or other extra-cerebral signal components).<fig id="Fig3"><label>Fig. 3</label><caption><p>Alignment of the NIRS channels on the cortex surface.

Two electrodes placed on the surface of the skin, bilaterally on the subjects’ supraspinatus muscles, measure the ratio of muscle tension between the right and left supraspinatus muscle. Reference electrodes placed on both mastoids complete the setup for the measurement. The value calculated by subtracting the normalized muscle tension of the left supraspinatus muscle from the normalized muscle tension of the right provides the feedback. Higher tension on the right will be equated to ‘activation’, higher tension on the left to ‘deactivation’.</p></sec><sec id="FPar14"><title>Accelerometer</title><p>In this study, accelerometers are used to objectively measure motor hyperactivity at the non-dominant wrist, hip, and ankle at pre-, post-, and follow-up measurement as well as during every training session. The accelerometer used in this study is the wGT3X+ by the company ActiGraph. This device measures acceleration on the vertical, horizontal, and perpendicular axes with a range of −6 to +6 g (g = gravitational force). This small and very light sensor (5.6 cm × 3.3 cm × 1.5 cm; 19 g) is fixed to the waistband using a light belt or a clip.

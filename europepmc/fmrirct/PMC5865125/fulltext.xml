Lifestyle changes towards a healthy diet, increased physical activity and reduced sedentary activities are recommended to prevent and treat obesity. Evidence suggests that changing these health behaviours can benefit cognitive function and school achievement in children and adolescents in general. There are various theoretical mechanisms that suggest that children and adolescents with excessive body fat may benefit particularly from these interventions.</p></sec><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>To assess whether lifestyle interventions (in the areas of diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and behavioural therapy) improve school achievement, cognitive function (e.g. executive functions) and/or future success in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight, compared with standard care, waiting-list control, no treatment, or an attention placebo control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Search methods</title><p>In February 2017, we searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and 15 other databases. We also searched two trials registries, reference lists, and handsearched one journal from inception. We also contacted researchers in the field to obtain unpublished data.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection criteria</title><p>We included randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of behavioural interventions for weight management in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. We excluded studies in children and adolescents with medical conditions known to affect weight status, school achievement and cognitive function. We also excluded self- and parent-reported outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>Four review authors independently selected studies for inclusion. Two review authors extracted data, assessed quality and risks of bias, and evaluated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We contacted study authors to obtain additional information. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Where the same outcome was assessed across different intervention types, we reported standardised effect sizes for findings from single-study and multiple-study analyses to allow comparison of intervention effects across intervention types. To ease interpretation of the effect size, we also reported the mean difference of effect sizes for single-study outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Main results</title><p>We included 18 studies (59 records) of 2384 children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. Eight studies delivered physical activity interventions, seven studies combined physical activity programmes with healthy lifestyle education, and three studies delivered dietary interventions. We included five RCTs and 13 cluster-RCTs. The studies took place in 10 different countries. Two were carried out in children attending preschool, 11 were conducted in primary/elementary school-aged children, four studies were aimed at adolescents attending secondary/high school and one study included primary/elementary and secondary/high school-aged children. The number of studies included for each outcome was low, with up to only three studies per outcome. The quality of evidence ranged from high to very low and 17 studies had a high risk of bias for at least one item. None of the studies reported data on additional educational support needs and adverse events.</p><p>Compared to standard practice, analyses of physical activity-only interventions suggested high-quality evidence for improved mean cognitive executive function scores. The mean difference (MD) was 5.00 scale points higher in an after-school exercise group compared to standard practice (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.68 to 9.32; scale mean 100, standard deviation 15; 116 children, 1 study). There was no statistically significant beneficial effect in favour of the intervention for mathematics, reading, or inhibition control. The standardised mean difference (SMD) for mathematics was 0.49 (95% CI -0.04 to 1.01; 2 studies, 255 children, moderate-quality evidence) and for reading was 0.10 (95% CI -0.30 to 0.49; 2 studies, 308 children, moderate-quality evidence). The MD for inhibition control was -1.55 scale points (95% CI -5.85 to 2.75; scale range 0 to 100; SMD -0.15, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.28; 1 study, 84 children, very low-quality evidence). No data were available for average achievement across subjects taught at school.</p><p>There was no evidence of a beneficial effect of physical activity interventions combined with healthy lifestyle education on average achievement across subjects taught at school, mathematics achievement, reading achievement or inhibition control. The MD for average achievement across subjects taught at school was 6.37 points lower in the intervention group compared to standard practice (95% CI -36.83 to 24.09; scale mean 500, scale SD 70; SMD -0.18, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.58; 1 study, 31 children, low-quality evidence). The effect estimate for mathematics achievement was SMD 0.02 (95% CI -0.19 to 0.22; 3 studies, 384 children, very low-quality evidence), for reading achievement SMD 0.00 (95% CI -0.24 to 0.24; 2 studies, 284 children, low-quality evidence), and for inhibition control SMD -0.67 (95% CI -1.50 to 0.16; 2 studies, 110 children, very low-quality evidence). No data were available for the effect of combined physical activity and healthy lifestyle education on cognitive executive functions.</p><p>There was a moderate difference in the average achievement across subjects taught at school favouring interventions targeting the improvement of the school food environment compared to standard practice in adolescents with obesity (SMD 0.46, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.66; 2 studies, 382 adolescents, low-quality evidence), but not with overweight. Replacing packed school lunch with a nutrient-rich diet in addition to nutrition education did not improve mathematics (MD -2.18, 95% CI -5.83 to 1.47; scale range 0 to 69; SMD -0.26, 95% CI -0.72 to 0.20; 1 study, 76 children, low-quality evidence) and reading achievement (MD 1.17, 95% CI -4.40 to 6.73; scale range 0 to 108; SMD 0.13, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.61; 1 study, 67 children, low-quality evidence).</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' conclusions</title><p>Despite the large number of childhood and adolescent obesity treatment trials, we were only able to partially assess the impact of obesity treatment interventions on school achievement and cognitive abilities. School and community-based physical activity interventions as part of an obesity prevention or treatment programme can benefit executive functions of children with obesity or overweight specifically. Similarly, school-based dietary interventions may benefit general school achievement in children with obesity. These findings might assist health and education practitioners to make decisions related to promoting physical activity and healthy eating in schools. Future obesity treatment and prevention studies in clinical, school and community settings should consider assessing academic and cognitive as well as physical outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Healthy weight interventions for improving thinking skills and school performance in children and teenagers with obesity</title><p><bold>What is the aim of this review?</bold></p><p>The aim of this Cochrane Review was to find out if healthy weight interventions can improve thinking skills and school performance in children and teenagers with obesity. Cochrane researchers collected and analysed all relevant studies to answer this question.</p><p><bold>What are the key messages?</bold></p><p>This updated review provides some evidence that school programmes that encourage healthier child weight may also provide &#x02018;co-benefits&#x02019; of thinking skills and school performance. However, we need more high-quality healthy-weight interventions that test thinking skills and school performance, as well as health outcomes.</p><p><bold>What was studied in this review?</bold></p><p>The number of children and teenagers with obesity is high worldwide. Some children and teenagers with obesity have health issues or are bullied because of their body weight. These experiences have been linked to problems in performing well in school, where they tend to perform less well in thinking tasks such as problem-solving. Physical activity and healthy eating benefit a healthy body weight and improve thinking skills and school performance in children with a healthy weight. Studies found that healthy-weight interventions can reduce obesity in children and teenagers, but it is unknown if and how well healthy-weight interventions can improve thinking skills and school performance in children and teenagers with obesity.</p><p><bold>What are the main results of this review?</bold></p><p>The review authors found 18 studies which included a total of 2384 children and teenagers with obesity. Five studies assigned individual children to intervention or control groups. Thirteen studies allocated entire classes, school or school districts to the intervention and control group. Of the 18 studies, 11 involved children at primary/elementary-school age. Eight studies offered physical activity interventions, seven studies combined physical activity programmes with healthy lifestyle education, and three studies offered dietary changes. The studies took place in 10 different countries. Seventeen studies had at least one flaw in how the study was done. This reduces the level of confidence we can have in the findings.</p><p>Few studies shared the same type of school performance or thinking skills. Only three studies reported the same outcome. None of the studies reported on additional educational support needs and harmful events. We found that, compared with usual routine, physical activity interventions can lead to small improvements in problem-solving skills. This finding was based on high-quality evidence. Moderate-quality findings showed that physical activity interventions do not improve mathematics and reading achievement in children with obesity. Very low-quality evidence also suggested no benefits of physical activity interventions for improving uncontrolled behavioural responses. General school achievement was not reported in studies comparing physical activity interventions with standard practice.</p><p>Studies that compared physical activity interventions plus healthy lifestyle education with standard practice were of low to very low quality. They showed no improvement in school achievement or uncontrolled behavioural responses in the intervention group compared to the control group. Problem-solving skills were not reported in studies comparing physical activity plus healthy lifestyle education with standard practice.</p><p>Our findings indicate that changing knowledge about nutrition, and changing the food offered in schools can lead to moderate improvements in general school achievement of teenagers with obesity, when compared to standard school practice. Replacing packed school lunch with a nutrient-rich diet plus nutrition education did not improve mathematics and reading achievement of children with obesity. However, the quality of evidence for general school achievement, mathematics and reading was low. This means that future research is very likely to change the results, because included studies showed some methodological weaknesses (for example, small numbers of children and a high dropout of children from studies). Problem-solving skills and uncontrolled behavioural responses were not reported for dietary intervention studies.</p><p><bold>How up-to-date is this review?</bold></p><p>The review authors searched the scientific literature for relevant studies in February 2017.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Summary of findings for the main comparison</title><table-wrap id="tab1" position="float"><table frame="border" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><bold>Physical activity interventions compared to standard practice for improving cognition and school achievement in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="7" rowspan="1"><bold>Patient or population:</bold> Children and adolescents with obesity or overweight<break/><bold>Setting:</bold> Classroom and school environment or as after-school activity in the USA, Norway, Spain, and The Netherlands<break/><bold>Intervention:</bold> Physical activity interventions (active academic lessons, extracurricular games, after-school group exercise)<break/><bold>Comparison:</bold> Standard practice (e.g. usual Physical Education curriculum)</td></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Outcomes</th><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="1">Illustrative comparative risks* (95% CI)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Relative effect (95% CI)**</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">&#x02116; of participants (studies)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Quality of the evidence (GRADE)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Comments</th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Assumed risk Standard practice</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Corresponding risk Physical activity</th></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>School achievement:</bold>

In clinical practice, child and adolescent overweight and obesity are commonly identified by age- and gender-specific body mass index (BMI) percentiles, BMI standard deviation scores, and waist circumference (WC) percentiles relative to a reference population (<xref rid="b161" ref-type="bibr">Reilly 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b165" ref-type="bibr">Rolland-Cachera 2011</xref>).</p><p>The primary criteria used to define overweight and obesity include:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>overweight: BMI or WC &#x02265; 85th percentile to 95th percentile, BMI = one standard deviation above the average;</p></list-item><list-item><p>obesity: BMI or WC = 95th percentile, BMI = two standard deviations above the average.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>Also, BMI cut-offs from the International Obesity Task Force (IOTF) are often used as a definition of overweight and obesity. These age-specific BMI cut-offs were constructed to match the definition for overweight and obesity in adults (BMI &#x02265; 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and BMI &#x02265; 30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively) (<xref rid="b88" ref-type="bibr">Cole 2000</xref>). Recently, the IOTF BMI cut-offs were reformulated to allow BMI to be expressed as standard deviation or percentile (<xref rid="b89" ref-type="bibr">Cole 2012</xref>).</p><p>A recent analysis of population data of children aged five to 19 years estimated that in 2016 obesity was identified in 50 million girls and 74 million boys worldwide (<xref rid="b146" ref-type="bibr">NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017</xref>). In the USA in 2014, the prevalence of child and adolescent obesity (BMI = 95<sup>th</sup> centile) was 9.4% (two to five years), 17.4% (six to 11 years), and 20.6% (12 to 19 years) (<xref rid="b152" ref-type="bibr">Ogden 2016</xref>). In Europe, obesity prevalence was on average 4.0% in adolescents, with vast differences between countries (<xref rid="b119" ref-type="bibr">Inchley 2017</xref>). For example, in Scotland the prevalence was 15% in adolescents aged 12 to 15 years (<xref rid="b168" ref-type="bibr">SHeS 2016</xref>). Childhood obesity prevalence is increasing in middle- and low-income countries (<xref rid="b146" ref-type="bibr">NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017</xref>), for example, up to 40% of children in Mexico were living with obesity or overweight, 32% in Lebanon and 28% in Argentina (<xref rid="b111" ref-type="bibr">Gupta 2012</xref>).</p><p>Health problems are common in children and adolescents with obesity. These include cardiovascular conditions (e.g. hyperlipidaemia, hypertension), endocrinologic conditions (e.g. Type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome), gastrointestinal conditions (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), respiratory conditions (e.g. obstructive sleep apnoea), musculoskeletal disorders, (e.g. slipped capital femoral epiphysis) and psychosocial disorders (e.g. depression, anxiety) (<xref rid="b109" ref-type="bibr">Grant-Guimaraes 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b114" ref-type="bibr">Han 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b158" ref-type="bibr">Puder 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b159" ref-type="bibr">Puhl 2007</xref>; <xref rid="b175" ref-type="bibr">Su 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cognitive deficits in children and adolescents (<xref rid="b84" ref-type="bibr">Bruce 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b95" ref-type="bibr">Delgado-Rico 2012a</xref>; <xref rid="b135" ref-type="bibr">Liang 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b139" ref-type="bibr">Martin 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b187" ref-type="bibr">Yu 2010</xref>) and academic deficits in adolescents associated with obesity have been observed (<xref rid="b81" ref-type="bibr">Booth 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b140" ref-type="bibr">Martin 2017</xref>). Cognitive skills such as the ability to suspend prepotent or default responses (inhibition), to switch between rules and responses (cognitive flexibility), to keep and retrieve information while working on a new task (working memory), and to concentrate (attention) are understood to predict school achievement in children and adolescents (<xref rid="b121" ref-type="bibr">Jacob 2015</xref>). Collectively, these cognitive abilities are known as executive functions. Evidence from prospective cohort studies suggests that obesity-related deficits in school achievement are more prevalent in adolescent girls than in boys and younger children (<xref rid="b140" ref-type="bibr">Martin 2017</xref>).</p><p>The academic consequences of adolescent obesity are shown to persist beyond schooling negatively influencing socioeconomic success. A Finnish longitudinal study (N = 9754, follow-up 17 years) suggests that adolescent obesity predicts unemployment in later life, with educational achievement as a mediating factor (<xref rid="b130" ref-type="bibr">Laitinen 2002</xref>). A British birth cohort study (N = 12,537) indicates that adolescent obesity (at age 16 years) is associated with fewer years of schooling and predicts lower income in young women (at age 23 years), including those who are no longer obese (<xref rid="b167" ref-type="bibr">Sargent 1994</xref>). These findings were further confirmed by <xref rid="b115" ref-type="bibr">Han 2011</xref>, using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (N = 1974, follow-up 12 to 16 years), and by <xref rid="b166" ref-type="bibr">Sabia 2012</xref>, using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 12,445, follow-up 13 years) in the USA.

Research indicates that children with obesity show higher impulsivity and inattention and lower reward sensitivity, self-regulation and cognitive flexibility compared with their healthy-weight peers. These neurocognitive correlates were associated with uncontrolled food intake and physical activity behaviour, and thus are assumed to predict weight gain (<xref rid="b104" ref-type="bibr">Francis 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b113" ref-type="bibr">Hall 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b129" ref-type="bibr">Kulendran 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b134" ref-type="bibr">Levitan 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b147" ref-type="bibr">Nederkoorn 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b173" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2011</xref>) or reduction of weight status after an obesity treatment intervention (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">Naar-King 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b148" ref-type="bibr">Nederkoorn 2007</xref>). Lifestyle interventions for weight management might positively impact the neurocognitive factors required for control of food intake. A randomised controlled trial conducted in 44 children (eight to 14 years of age) with obesity or overweight suggested that specific training of self-regulatory abilities improved weight-loss maintenance after an inpatient weight-loss programme in the intervention group compared with the control group (<xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">Verbeken 2013</xref>). Findings from another randomised controlled overweight treatment programme involving 62 children (mean age 10.3 &#x000b1; 1.1 years) showed improved problem-solving skills after an intervention duration of six months (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Epstein 2000</xref>). Inhibition control skills were improved in 42 obese adolescents from 12 to 17 years of age after 12 weeks of cognitive-behavioural therapy (<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">Delgado-Rico 2012b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Lifestyle interventions</title><p>Growing evidence has shown that the influence of lifestyle interventions, particularly physical activity and dietary intervention, lie beyond the alteration of energy balance. Many aspects of physical activity, diet and other behaviours have been demonstrated to benefit cognition and school achievement in children and adolescents, regardless of their body weight status, as summarised below.</p><sec><title>Physical activity</title><p>Recently, <xref rid="b100" ref-type="bibr">Faught 2017</xref> reported that meeting the Canadian recommendations for diet, physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep at age 11 years was associated with favourable school achievement at age 12 (N = 4253). Low levels of physical fitness (<xref rid="b87" ref-type="bibr">Chaddock 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b94" ref-type="bibr">Davis 2011a</xref>; <xref rid="b160" ref-type="bibr">Raine 2013</xref>) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity have also been linked to impaired cognitive functions in children (<xref rid="b112" ref-type="bibr">Haapala 2017</xref>). In addition to the observational evidence, a substantial body of literature suggests a causal relationship between increased levels of physical activity and cognitive function or school achievement or both. For example, a meta-analysis of 44 experimental and cross-sectional studies (in participants aged four to 18 years) indicates that increased physical activity caused significant overall improvement in cognitive function and school performance (Hedge's <italic>g</italic> = 0.32; standard deviation (SD) 0.27) (<xref rid="b170" ref-type="bibr">Sibley 2003</xref>). A recent meta-analysis of 21 experimental and quasi-experimental studies in children aged four to 16 years (N = 4044) also reported a moderate positive effect of physical activity interventions on cognitive outcomes (Hedge's <italic>g</italic> = 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.64) (<xref rid="b178" ref-type="bibr">Vazou 2016</xref>).</p><p>Physical activity may affect cognitive function and school achievement through physiological mechanisms (elevated blood circulation, increased levels of neurotrophins and neurotransmitters) (<xref rid="b96" ref-type="bibr">Dishman 2006</xref>), learning and motor developmental mechanisms (<xref rid="b157" ref-type="bibr">Pesce 2016a</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dietary modification</title><p>Composition of the diet may impact cognition and school achievement by altering neurotrophic and neuroendocrine factors involved in learning and memory. As shown in animal research, these factors are decreased by high-energy diets containing saturated fat and simple sugars, and are increased by diets that are rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and micronutrients (<xref rid="b107" ref-type="bibr">Gomez-Pinilla 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b125" ref-type="bibr">Kanoski 2011</xref>). These findings were also observed in children. Cross-sectional data of school-aged children linked dietary intake of omega-3 fatty acids to increased memory performance (<xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Baym 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b82" ref-type="bibr">Boucher 2011</xref>), while consumption of food rich in saturated fatty acids and refined sugar was associated with decreased memory performance (<xref rid="b77" ref-type="bibr">Baym 2014</xref>). Longitudinal observational data suggest that diets high in fat and sugar in preschool children (N = 3966; aged three to four years) are associated with decreased intelligence and school performance at primary/elementary school age (<xref rid="b102" ref-type="bibr">Feinstein 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b151" ref-type="bibr">Northstone 2011</xref>). A controlled healthy school meal intervention over three years in more than 80,000 children led to improved mathematics, English and science achievement (<xref rid="b78" ref-type="bibr">Belot 2011</xref>). Promotion of healthier school food at lunchtime and changes in the school dining environment over 12 weeks improved classroom on-task behaviour in preschool children compared to controls (<xref rid="b106" ref-type="bibr">Golley 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b174" ref-type="bibr">Storey 2011</xref>). An improvement in dietary quality could therefore have beneficial effects on cognition and school achievement even without improved weight status.</p></sec><sec><title>Sedentary behaviour</title><p>A sedentary lifestyle in children, particularly television-viewing for two or more hours a day, is associated with the development of obesity or overweight (review of 71 studies; <xref rid="b163" ref-type="bibr">Rey-Lopez 2008</xref>) and may replace opportunities to engage in activities that promote scholastic and cognitive development. To our knowledge, there is no published literature on the effect of reduced sedentary behaviour and improved cognitive and academic outcomes of children and adolescents. However, epidemiological evidence suggests that high levels of sedentary behaviour are associated with reduced school achievement or cognitive abilities. For example, longitudinal data indicate that children younger than three years of age with low television exposure (less than three hours a day) performed better than those with high television exposure (three or more hours a day) in reading (N = 1031) and mathematics (N = 1797) (Peabody Individual Achievement Test) when at preschool age (<xref rid="b189" ref-type="bibr">Zimmerman 2005</xref>). Similarly, parent-reported television viewing in preschool children was inversely related to mathematics achievement at age 10 years (N = 1314) (<xref rid="b155" ref-type="bibr">Pagani 2010</xref>) and reading achievement at age 10 to 12 years (N = 308) (<xref rid="b99" ref-type="bibr">Ennemoser 2007</xref>). Low TV exposure was also linked to improved school achievement in 8061 adolescents aged 16 years (<xref rid="b126" ref-type="bibr">Kantomaa 2016</xref>). Longer-term educational outcomes may also be affected. <xref rid="b116" ref-type="bibr">Hancox 2005</xref> found that young people (N = 980; follow-up 21 years) with the highest television viewing time during childhood and adolescence tended to have no formal educational qualifications, and those with a university degree watched the least television during childhood and adolescence. Television viewing for three or more hours a day at age 14 years (N = 678) was associated with a two-fold risk of failing to obtain a post&#x02013;secondary/high school education at 33 years of age compared with those watching television for less than one hour a day, mediated by attention difficulties, frequent failure to complete homework and negative attitudes about school at 16 years of age (<xref rid="b123" ref-type="bibr">Johnson 2007</xref>). Studies relating accelerometer-measured sedentary behaviour to cognitive function or school achievement or both indicated that high levels of sedentary behaviour at age seven years were associated with reduced verbal reasoning skills at age 11 (<xref rid="b71" ref-type="bibr">Aggio 2016</xref>), and that low levels of sedentary behaviour were associated with increased school achievement at age 10 to 11 years (<xref rid="b70" ref-type="bibr">Aadland 2017</xref>).</p><p>Reducing sedentary behaviour (TV and screen time, sitting time) might therefore improve cognitive function and school achievement in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight.</p></sec><sec><title>Multicomponent interventions</title><p>In this review, the term 'multicomponent interventions' refers to interventions that target at least two obesity-related behaviours. Multicomponent lifestyle interventions may benefit cognitive function and school achievement in the general population, i.e. a study population that includes both children and adolescents of normal weight and those with obesity or overweight. For example, after the implementation of an uncontrolled intervention involving healthy nutrition, physical activity and using behaviour change techniques in a US primary/elementary school, an upward trend in reading performance scores was noted; these scores exceeded the national average by 10% after eight years (<xref rid="b145" ref-type="bibr">Nansel 2009</xref>). Another uncontrolled experimental study, which implemented a healthy diet and physical activity programme in a primary/elementary school, reported an increase in the numbers of children passing standardised tests in writing, reading and mathematics by 25%, 27% and 31%, respectively (<xref rid="b171" ref-type="bibr">Sibley 2008</xref>). A similar but controlled school-based intervention promoting healthy eating and physical activity behaviour in children aged 11 to 14 years led to significant improvement in mathematics, listening and speaking scores after only five weeks compared with the control condition (standard classroom education) (<xref rid="b169" ref-type="bibr">Shilts 2009</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Why it is important to do this review</title><p>The current global trend in childhood obesity (<xref rid="b146" ref-type="bibr">NCD Risk Factor Collaboration 2017</xref>; <xref rid="b183" ref-type="bibr">WHO 2016</xref>) suggests that the prevalence of cognitive and educational problems among children is also likely to increase.

What is less clear is the extent to which interventions which modify lifestyle or body fatness or both can improve cognitive function and learning/school achievement.

We obtained translations for articles written in Chinese (Mandarin), Korean, Spanish, Turkish, Portuguese, and Persian.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data collection and analysis</title><sec><title>Selection of studies</title><p>We used the web-based software platform <xref rid="b92" ref-type="bibr">Covidence</xref> to view, screen and select studies. AM, JNB and YL independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed their eligibility to identify potentially relevant trials. AM, YL and DHS assessed full reports for eligibility. We resolved different opinions about eligibility by discussion; when the review authors did not agree, the other review authors (JS and JJR) arbitrated. We recorded the reasons for excluding trials in the PRISMA diagram.</p></sec><sec><title>Data extraction and management</title><p>AM, YL and DHS extracted study characteristics using a predefined data extraction form, with AM and YL cross-checking the extracts. The data extraction form included the following items:</p><p>General information: review author ID, title, published or unpublished, study authors, year of publication, country, contact address, source of study.</p><p>Methods (including 'Risk of bias' assessment): study design, randomisation methods, allocation concealment, blinding, handling of missing data, selective data reporting.</p><p>Population: age, gender, ethnicity, proportion of children with obesity or overweight; inclusion and exclusion criteria; number of participants recruited, included and followed (total and in comparison groups); diagnostic criteria of overweight or obesity; comparability of groups at baseline; comorbidities.</p><p>Intervention: type(s), frequency, mode of delivery, intensity of physical activity, methods and timing of comparison of intervention, setting, intervention and follow-up duration, who delivered the intervention, attrition rates, assessment of compliance, details of comparison and control.</p><p>Outcome: assessor characteristics, baseline measures, measures immediately after intervention and at follow-up, follow-up time points, validity of measurement tools, definition of outcome (e.g. units, scales), primary outcomes, secondary outcomes.</p><p>Results: Where no suitable published data were available, AM contacted the study authors to obtain unpublished data for children and adolescents with overweight or obesity, which were a subgroup of the study sample. AM therefore extracted the result data for each outcome (mean, events, measures of variance, sample sizes), which were double-checked by YL.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of risk of bias in included studies</title><p>AM and DHS independently assessed the risks of bias in each trial, using the Cochrane 'Risk of bias' tool (Chapter 8.5 in <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>). Findings were cross-checked and discrepancies resolved through discussion. This included assessment of selection bias (random sequence allocation and allocation concealment), performance bias (blinding of participants and personnel), detection bias (blinding of outcome assessment), attrition bias (incomplete outcome data), reporting bias (selective reporting) and other sources of bias. The review authors judged the risk of bias as 'high', 'low' or 'unclear', using the information provided.</p></sec><sec><title>Measures of treatment effect</title><p>We calculated or extracted the mean change from baseline for intervention and comparison groups, and calculated the mean difference (MD) of change between the groups, when continuous data (e.g. numerical marks) were measured on the same scale. When similar outcomes were measured on different scales, we calculated the standardised mean difference (SMD). Where it was not possible to determine the change from baseline, we calculated MD or SMD using post-intervention (endpoint) values.</p><p>There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate method to use in assessing cognitive ability and school achievement; different researchers tend to use different tools to measure the same outcome. Where the same outcome was assessed across different intervention types, we reported SMD for findings from single-study and multiple-study analyses to allow the comparison of intervention effects across intervention types. To ease interpretation of the effect size, we also reported the MD of effect sizes for single-study outcomes.</p><p>We calculated all effect sizes so that positive effect sizes indicate better performance on cognitive function and school achievement outcomes in favour of the intervention group compared to the comparison group.</p><p>Included studies did not provide dichotomous or ordinal data. However, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec102">Appendix 2</xref>, we describe how we intend to treat these types of data if available, as predefined in our protocol (<xref rid="b190" ref-type="bibr">Martin 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Unit of analysis issues</title><sec><title>Cluster-randomised trials</title><p>We scanned all included studies with clustered randomisation of participants for appropriate analysis of clustered data. Ignoring the proportion of total variance attributable to clustering can result in underpowered study designs and inflation of type I error rates, i.e. increased false-positive results (<xref rid="b83" ref-type="bibr">Brown 2015</xref>). Therefore, for studies in which control of clustering was missing or insufficient at sample size calculation or analysis stage, and when individual participant data were not available, we approximately corrected the intervention effects of cluster-RCTs. We reduced the size of each trial to its 'effective sample size' (<xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>). We calculated the effective sample size in studies with continuous data by dividing the sample size by the design effect, which is [1 + (M-1)* ICC], where M is the average cluster size and ICC is the intracluster correlation coefficient. When no ICC was obtainable, we used the ICC estimate of a similar study. In <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec103">Appendix 3</xref>, we provide an overview of the ICCs used to estimate the effective sample size. Some trial authors provided recalculated ICCs for school or cognitive outcomes, or both, which were previously unpublished. We performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the robustness of conclusions from meta-analyses that included cluster-randomised trials (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec104">Sensitivity analysis</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cross-over trials</title><p>We considered cross-over trials as eligible for inclusion if participants were randomly assigned into the first period. We included only data from the first period before the cross-over took place.</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple interventions per individual</title><p>We performed separate comparisons for studies that compared the effects of a single intervention (e.g. physical activity alone) versus a control condition and studies that compared a combination of any types and numbers of interventions of interest (e.g. physical activity with health behaviour education) versus a control condition.</p><p>We entered multiple intervention arms of the same study as separate interventions in the meta-analysis. We divided the sample size of the control group by the number of intervention arms in the study to avoid overestimating the pooled effect size. We left the means and standard deviations unchanged, as recommended in the <italic>Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions</italic> (Section 16.5.4. <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Multiple time points</title><p>In separate meta-analyses, we analysed data from studies that reported results at more than one time point with comparable data of other studies at similar time points.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Dealing with missing data</title><p>When possible, we recorded characteristics of, reasons for and quantities of missing data for all included studies. We contacted trial authors to obtain information on missing data, if not reported. In our analyses, we ignored data judged to be 'missing at random'. When possible, we imputed missing values in individual participant data, using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method. We performed sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of including imputed data in meta-analyses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec104">Sensitivity analysis</xref>).</p><p>Included studies did not provide sufficient individual participant data to perform an individual participant data meta-analysis. Should these become available from the study authors and prove to benefit the review, we will follow the guidance in <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref> (Chapter 18).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of heterogeneity</title><p>We assessed clinical heterogeneity by comparing the similarities of included studies in terms of participants, interventions (type, duration, mode of delivery, setting) and outcomes. By comparing study design and risks of bias, we evaluated methodological heterogeneity. We assessed statistical heterogeneity across studies by visual inspection of the forest plot, and we used the Chi<sup>2</sup> test with a significance level of P &#x0003c; 0.1 because of its low power in detecting heterogeneity when studies are low in sample size and numbers of events (section 9.5.2 <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>). Guided by the <italic>Cochrane Handbook</italic> (section 9.5.4 <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>), we estimated the between-study variance in a random-effects meta-analysis (Tau<sup>2</sup>) in addition to the percentage of variability of intervention effect due to statistical heterogeneity ( I<sup>2</sup> ). Variability greater than 50% may indicate moderate to substantial heterogeneity of intervention effects (section 9.5.2 <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>). Furthermore, we assessed the cause of heterogeneity by conducting subgroup and sensitivity analyses, as described below (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec105">Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec104">Sensitivity analysis</xref>, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of reporting biases</title><p>We had planned to assess reporting bias by using funnel plots but were unable to do so because of insufficient numbers of included studies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec102">Appendix 2</xref> and <xref rid="b190" ref-type="bibr">Martin 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Data synthesis</title><p>We used Review Manager 5 (RevMan 5) (<xref rid="b162" ref-type="bibr">Review Manager 2014</xref>) for data entry and analysis. We combined outcome data from included studies in meta-analyses when the outcome measure addressed the same measurement concept (e.g. mathematics achievement). Where separate data for children and adolescents with overweight and for children and adolescents with obesity were available, we included them separately in the meta-analysis. This was done with the intention to explore a potential &#x02018;dose-response&#x02019; of the intervention effect relative to the weight category. Where the same study reported several outcome variables for one outcome measurement, we included the outcome variable that was comparable with outcomes reported by other included studies. For example, if reaction time and errors were both given for the cognitive outcome 'attention', then we reported only errors to ensure comparability with other studies which solely reported errors.</p><p>Health behaviour interventions have inherent heterogeneity due to intervention implementation and setting, so the true intervention effect is likely to vary between studies. We therefore pooled data using the random-effects model and provided effect sizes of studies that were inappropriate to include in a meta-analysis.</p><sec><title>'Summary of findings' tables</title><p>We summarised outcomes relevant for decision-making in health and education practice or policy or both (<xref rid="b75" ref-type="bibr">Balshem 2011</xref>) in 'Summary of findings' tables, using the GRADE approach. The recommended number of primary outcomes to be reported in the table is seven. We considered the following outcomes to be the most relevant:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Average achievement across subjects taught at school;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Mathematics achievement;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reading achievement;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Additional educational support needs;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Composite executive functions;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Inhibition control;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Adverse events.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>We used the GRADEprofiler Guideline Development Tool (<xref rid="b108" ref-type="bibr">GRADEpro GDT 2015</xref>) to generate the tables for which we imported data directly from RevMan 5 (<xref rid="b162" ref-type="bibr">Review Manager 2014</xref>). These comparison-specific tables provide details for each outcome concerning the assessment tools used, follow-up range, timing of follow-up, study design, number of studies, total sample sizes, effect estimates, and the quality of evidence. Two review authors (AM, DHS) assessed the quality of the evidence, resolving disagreements through discussion with a third review author (JNB).</p><p>We determined the quality of the evidence by assessing the methodological quality on outcome level, heterogeneity, the directness of evidence, the precision of evidence, and risk of publication bias. Where the evidence came from small studies, we assessed the extent of the limitation of 'unclear risk of bias on randomisation' on our confidence in the evidence by consulting the risk-of-bias item &#x02018;comparability of groups at baseline&#x02019;. We did not consider an unclear risk of selection bias as a serious limitation where we had rated the risk-of-bias item &#x02018;comparability of groups at baseline&#x02019; at low risk of bias. A low risk of bias of known baseline characteristics may suggest adequate randomisation, so we have confidence in the evidence. Where we rated &#x02018;comparability of groups at baseline&#x02019; at unclear or high risk of bias, we considered an 'unclear risk of bias on randomisation' as a serious limitation and so downgraded the quality of evidence to reflect our limited confidence in the evidence. However, we acknowledge that variables that were not tested for may cause imbalance between groups and that imbalances can occur by chance, despite adequate randomisation.</p><p>GRADE specifies four quality levels:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>High quality: further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the effect estimate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Moderate quality: further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and may change the estimate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Low quality: further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimate and may change the estimate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Very low quality: we are very uncertain about the effect estimate.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>For ease of interpretation of the standardised effect sizes, we applied rules of thumb, where a standard deviation (SD) of 0.2 represents a small difference between groups, 0.5 represents a moderate difference, and 0.8 represents a large difference (section 12.6.2 in <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>). Where both change-from-baseline and endpoint data were available for the same outcome, we reported the evidence of highest quality. When the quality of evidence was the same for outcomes generated from endpoint and change-from-baseline data, we reported change-from-baseline outcomes in the 'Summary of findings' table.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec105"><title>Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity</title><p>Subgroup analyses are principally intended to investigate sources of heterogeneity within a meta-analysis in relation to factors that potentially impact outcomes. We identified several potentially influential participant and intervention characteristics for subgroup analyses (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec102">Appendix 2</xref>). The low number of studies included for the same outcome did not allow us to perform meaningful subgroup analyses for all predefined sources of heterogeneity. However, we performed a subgroup analysis for body weight status (overweight versus obesity), where possible.</p></sec><sec id="sec104"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><p>We investigated the influence of study characteristics on the robustness of the review results by conducting sensitivity analyses.

This finding was also of low quality and further research is very likely to change the effect estimates.</p></sec><sec><title>Change in obesity by intervention effectiveness on school or cognitive outcomes</title><p>Based on our descriptive analysis, we were not able to detect a conclusive pattern linking improved school or cognitive outcomes with a reduction in obesity. Three studies indicated that highly-intense interventions that involve daily exposure to physical activity or nutrition education, or both, can result in both significant change in obesity indicators and cognitive and academic outcomes compared to standard practice. However, one high-intensity study that indicated a significant reduction in total body fat did not result in improved cognitive outcomes for the intervention group. Another study showed improved school attainment and cognitive functions but benefits on BMI z-scores were not evident in the intervention group compared to standard practice.</p><p>The absence of an effect on school achievement or cognitive outcomes, or both, might be attributable to poor adherence to the experimental condition, particularly when the intervention was applied in participants' homes (e.g. physical activity homework tasks). Assessment of participants' compliance with the intervention was often poorly reported. We observed a similar bias for assessment of adherence to the control condition. Most studies did not attempt to evaluate or report whether the control group maintained its &#x02018;standard practice&#x02019; during the trial period. For example, changes in school policy concerning healthy lifestyle factors such as improved school meals or physical activity opportunities during recess could potentially bias the intervention effects of experimental trials. The same may account for engagement in lifestyle changes at the family or child level.</p><p>The included studies provided no evidence of harm in terms of deterioration in any of the cognitive or school achievement outcomes. No data currently exist on whether lifestyle interventions for weight management of children and adolescents with obesity or overweight influence the need for additional educational support and indices of future success once schooling has been completed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Overall completeness and applicability of evidence</title><p>Our population group of interest - children and adolescents with obesity or overweight - is a very specific yet substantial and globally increasing subgroup of the general population. Of the 18 included studies, the study population of only six studies were children or adolescents with obesity or overweight. Most of the identified studies aimed to prevent obesity in the general population and did not report cognitive and academic outcomes of the subgroup with obesity or overweight separately from those of children in the healthy weight category. This was surprising, since 11 of the 18 studies stated cognitive function or school achievement among their primary outcomes. Despite our efforts to obtain them, the subgroup data for some studies have not been available to date (see Characteristics of studies awaiting classification). Based on our assessment of the quality of the evidence, we are confident that further research is likely to influence the estimates of the intervention effects for all assessed outcomes (see Quality of the evidence). Overall, the results of this review suggest applicability of the findings for public health practice for some but not all assessed outcomes (see Implications for practice).</p><p>Most of the included studies were conducted in the primary/elementary school setting. Only two studies contributed to the evidence on intervention effects in preschool-aged children and five studies targeted adolescents enrolled in secondary (junior high/high) school. One plausible reason for this imbalance might be that primary/elementary-school-aged children seem old enough to understand instructions and young enough to comply with the intervention protocol. The influence of puberty on cognitive development might also contribute to more researchers focusing on pre-pubertal adolescents (<xref rid="b124" ref-type="bibr">Juraska 2014</xref>). However, the developmental trajectories of cognitive abilities related to school achievement span preschool age and late adolescence (<xref rid="b80" ref-type="bibr">Boelema 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b93" ref-type="bibr">Davidson 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b180" ref-type="bibr">Waber 2007</xref>), and differential effects of behaviour change interventions at different ages are plausible. The overall low number of studies included for each outcome did not allow us to formally test the effectiveness of the intervention by age group. Nevertheless, we identified two ongoing trials in preschool-aged children (<xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">Po'e 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b69" ref-type="bibr">Stanley 2016</xref>) and two in adolescents (<xref rid="b57" ref-type="bibr">Bau 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">RBR-38p23s</xref>) which assessed intervention effects on cognitive and academic outcomes in participants with obesity or overweight.</p><p>All but one (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa Filho 2017 [pers comm]</xref>) of the included studies were conducted in high-income countries and most studies (14/18 studies) included children primarily from middle-income families. The reported evidence might therefore not be applicable to low- and middle-income countries. In addition, a potentially differential effect of physical activity, diet and other behavioural interventions on cognition and school achievement of children with obesity or overweight growing up in a socio-economically deprived environment remains to be investigated. The evidence on the association between obesity and poverty (<xref rid="b117" ref-type="bibr">Hardy 2017</xref>; <xref rid="b136" ref-type="bibr">Lissner 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b181" ref-type="bibr">Wang 2012</xref>), and the associations between lower education and cognitive skills and poverty (<xref rid="b91" ref-type="bibr">Cooper 2013</xref>; <xref rid="b138" ref-type="bibr">Marteau 2013</xref>) support further efforts in identifying who could benefit most from obesity-related health behaviour interventions.</p><p>There was no evidence available on the effect of interventions targeting the quality and duration of sleep, or sedentary behaviour, or both, despite its association with obesity and impaired cognitive or academic performance or both. However, the healthy lifestyle education component of <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">Barbosa Filho 2017 [pers comm]</xref> and <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">Wirt 2013 [pers comm]</xref> included lessons on reducing media screen time, and <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">Ahamed 2007</xref>, <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">De Greeff 2016</xref>, <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Johnston 2013</xref> and <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Resaland 2016</xref> delivered physically active classroom lessons. Both education on reducing media screen time and physically active lessons might be considered as an intervention component to decrease sedentary behaviour (time spent sitting). In addition, one feasibility trial is currently ongoing, testing whether reduced sitting time in school can improve cognitive outcomes (&#x02018;Stand Up For Health&#x02019; study, trial register: ACTRN12614001001684). Although this trial listed obesity/overweight as a target health condition, the trial register entry did not mention assessment of change in adiposity.</p><p>Although two studies provided outcome data for two follow-up time points (<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">De Greeff 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Huang 2015</xref>), the data related to mid- and immediately post-intervention. Participants in <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Huang 2015</xref> received a low-intensity maintenance intervention after completion of the intense six-week day camp. We therefore could not fully explore the retention effect of interventions for weight management on school achievement and cognitive functions in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. Nevertheless, the findings of <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Huang 2015</xref> indicate that the beneficial effect of the day-camp intervention compared to attention control on visuo-spatial abilities was not maintained after completion of the 13-month family-based maintenance intervention.</p><p>It remains unclear whether changes in academic and cognitive abilities were connected to changes in indices of obesity, due to the small amount of suitable data, and variations in study architecture (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Davis 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Huang 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Johnston 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Quality of the evidence</title><p>We separately assessed the quality of evidence of the most important outcomes for decision-making for each comparison of the three intervention types (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>The quality of evidence for Comparison 1 - physical activity-only interventions compared to standard practice - was high to very low. The reason for downgrading the evidence on mathematics achievement and reading achievement was a high risk of attrition bias. The attrition rate was 14% to 16% in most of the studies contributing to the evidence. No imputation of missing data was performed and we found higher attrition in the comparison condition compared to the intervention group. We downgraded the quality of evidence for inhibition control by three levels, for high risk of attrition and selection bias and for imprecision. Missing outcome data were not accounted for and the sample sizes were 31 participants for language achievement and 84 for inhibition control. For inhibition control, the method of randomisation was unclear, with a high risk of bias in the comparability of groups at baseline.</p><p>The quality of evidence for Comparison 2 &#x02013; physical activity plus healthy lifestyle education intervention compared to standard practice &#x02013; was low to very low. We downgraded the quality of evidence for mathematics achievement by three levels for inconsistency of the effect estimates, imprecision of the effect estimate and methodological shortcomings related to a high risk of bias for sequence generation, blinding of outcome assessors and attrition. We downgraded the quality of evidence for reading by two levels, for effect estimates of reading achievement being inconsistent between studies and for risk of bias in the study methodology. One of the two included studies was at high risk of bias for sequence generation and one study was at high risk of attrition bias, with 29% of incomplete outcome data. We downgraded the quality of evidence for inhibition control by two levels because we detected selection bias and a high risk of attrition bias characterised by twice as much missing outcome data in the control group compared to the intervention group (26% versus 13%).</p><p>The quality of evidence for Comparison 3 &#x02013; dietary intervention compared to standard practice - was low for average achievement across subjects taught at school, mathematics and reading achievements and attention performance. We downgraded the quality of evidence for average achievement across subjects taught at school by two levels for methodological shortcomings in blinding of the outcome assessor and for attrition bias (21% to 29%). We downgraded the quality of the remaining outcomes by two levels for imprecision (the sample sizes ranged between 76 and 61 children) and for not blinding the outcome assessor.</p></sec><sec><title>Potential biases in the review process</title><p>We searched 17 electronic databases, two trial registers and handsearched one journal to identify published and ongoing trials. We also contacted 15 trial authors to obtain unpublished data and obtained unpublished outcome data from 12 studies. However, we acquired adverse-events data only from published records.</p><p>Nevertheless, we intended to review evidence in a specific subgroup of the general population; the following limitation should therefore be considered. The unpublished data provided by the study authors were extracted for a subgroup of the total study sample, leading to overall small sample sizes for inclusion in this review. This might have affected the studies' power to detect an intervention effect. Studies which provided unpublished data for the subgroup of children with obesity or overweight may have been powered for the total study sample.</p><p>Included studies used a wide range of school achievement and cognitive function test tools. Previous reviews, such as that of <xref rid="b173" ref-type="bibr">Smith 2011</xref>, suggest that obesity might have a detrimental impact on some aspects of cognition, so we conducted a categorisation of outcome measures. The use of composite scores in some studies precluded more fine-grained synthesis. For example, the planning subscale of the cognitive assessment system (CAS) is a composite score from three different measures of executive function, none of which are comparable to more traditional measures of planning such as the Tower of London task. As composite scores were reported in some cases, we categorised outcome measures as 'general executive function', rather than more discrete aspects of executive function (e.g. inhibition). Alternative categorisation of cognitive outcomes might impact on the conclusions drawn. Even though there tend to be correlations between cognitive function tests (because of the general cognitive factor <italic>g</italic>), different cognitive tests vary in their specificity for different cognitive domains. Moreover, successive testing before and after the intervention is likely to improve participant scores through repeated measures and regression to the mean. Thus, an improvement may not be due to the intervention, although the use of change-from-baseline data and the use of a comparison group allows some control for this. On the other hand, small participant numbers limit the ability to minimise bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews</title><p>To our knowledge, no primary studies have been conducted other than those reviewed here. The systematic literature review by <xref rid="b85" ref-type="bibr">Bustamante 2016</xref> narratively synthesised the evidence of physical activity interventions on cognitive and academic outcomes in youth with obesity or overweight. The authors included quasi-experimental and randomised controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals before December 2015. The literature search was conducted in three selected electronic databases (PubMed, Journals@OVID, and Web of Science). Five RCTs were included in the review, of which we include four in this Cochrane Review (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Davis 2011b</xref>; <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Huang 2015</xref>; <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Krafft 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Staiano 2012</xref>). We did not include the remaining RCT (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Crova 2014</xref>) because the study did not aim to modify body weight status and so was not eligible for inclusion. The quasi-experimental studies included in <xref rid="b85" ref-type="bibr">Bustamante 2016</xref> were uncontrolled single-group trials, case-control studies or short, single-session (acute bout) physical activity interventions, which we did not consider eligible for inclusion in this review. <xref rid="b85" ref-type="bibr">Bustamante 2016</xref> concluded that, based on a single RCT, regular physical activity was more beneficial for improving executive functions than monthly lifestyle education classes (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">Davis 2011b</xref>). This finding is consistent with our results.</p><p><xref rid="b85" ref-type="bibr">Bustamante 2016</xref> argued that when regular physical activity interventions are compared to an attention control activity that involved organised activities supervised by adults, the beneficial effect of the physical activity intervention on academic and cognitive outcomes (detected using psychometric test batteries) is outweighed by the attention received in the comparison group (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">Krafft 2014</xref>). Findings of our evidence synthesis suggest otherwise. Studies that compare physical activity interventions with standard practice, which typically also involve organised activities supervised by adults (i.e. teachers), resulted in significant improvements in academic and cognitive outcomes (e.g. <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Resaland 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">S&#x000e1;nchez-L&#x000f3;pez 2017 [pers comm]</xref>). Furthermore, the comparison condition in <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Huang 2015</xref> was an active intervention providing attention to participants. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">Huang 2015</xref> demonstrated a beneficial intervention effect on some cognitive skills compared to attention control.</p><p>Several systematic reviews are available on the effects of physical activity (<xref rid="b97" ref-type="bibr">Donnelly 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b101" ref-type="bibr">Fedewa 2011</xref>; <xref rid="b170" ref-type="bibr">Sibley 2003</xref>, <xref rid="b178" ref-type="bibr">Vazou 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b179" ref-type="bibr">Verburgh 2014</xref>), dietary (<xref rid="b98" ref-type="bibr">Ells 2008</xref>) and general school health interventions (<xref rid="b132" ref-type="bibr">Langford 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b144" ref-type="bibr">Murray 2007</xref>) on school achievement and cognitive outcomes in the general population. Although these systematic reviews may include some children with obesity or overweight, they lack a separate analysis of the effect estimates in our population groups of interest. Research suggests a greater benefit of obesity-related health behaviour interventions in children with obesity or overweight compared to children with healthy weight (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Crova 2014</xref>; <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">Grieco 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b177" ref-type="bibr">Vazou 2014</xref>). These reviews are therefore not directly comparable with our review.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' conclusions</title><sec><title>Implications for practice</title><p>This review provides some evidence that interventions which promote physical activity may be effective in producing small improvements in composite executive functions and non-verbal memory in primary/elementary school-aged children with obesity or overweight specifically. However, this evidence is based on a small number of studies. On current evidence, we are unable to determine the impact of these interventions on school achievement or cognitive skills. The current evidence on the effectiveness of interventions that combine healthy lifestyle education with physical activity promotion and dietary interventions does not allow us to draw definitive conclusions on their impact on cognitive and academic outcomes. In the absence of data, it is not possible to determine the impact of physical activity, dietary and other behavioural interventions on additional educational support, adverse events or outcomes related to future educational achievements such as years of schooling, employment rates or income.</p><p>Evidence on the effects of physical activity or dietary interventions on school achievement and cognitive functions in children with obesity or overweight conducted in clinical settings (e.g. hospitals, outpatient clinics, primary care) is missing, so we cannot offer implications for clinical practice in settings beyond school and community settings.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for research</title><p>We identified studies in school, after-school and community settings, but we found no evidence on cognitive and academic outcomes of behavioural weight management interventions in a clinical setting. However, our findings indicate beneficial effects of physical activity interventions on cognitive outcomes, namely cognitive executive functions, in children with obesity or overweight. Cognitive executive functions have been associated with the ability to control food intake (<xref rid="b76" ref-type="bibr">Bartholdy 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b122" ref-type="bibr">Jansen 2015</xref>) and engagement in health behaviour (<xref rid="b113" ref-type="bibr">Hall 2014</xref>). Child and adolescent weight management programmes in a clinical setting should include measurements of cognitive outcomes for two reasons. Firstly, the most effective strategies for weight management could be informed when linking cognitive abilities with behaviour change. Secondly, children with obesity or overweight are the target population of weight management programmes in clinical settings. If studies of interventions in clinical settings were to include measures of cognitive outcomes and related school achievement, these would help to boost the power of studies to identify potential gains in these areas. Similarly, community-based interventions which directly target children and adolescents with obesity and which assess cognitive and academic outcomes are needed to advance the evidence. In addition, the availability of larger studies might allow the assessment of a differential intervention effect for participants with overweight and participants with obesity in relation to school achievement and cognitive functions.</p><p>In terms of the targeted obesity-related health behaviours, evidence was available for solely physical activity interventions, physical activity plus healthy lifestyle education interventions and dietary interventions, which also included nutrition education. Our findings suggest that interventions focusing on one target behaviour, i.e. physical activity, yielded beneficial effects on composite executive functions, non-verbal memory and general intelligence compared to standard practice. In contrast, interventions targeting several health behaviours through healthy lifestyle education and active physical activity programmes did not result in beneficial effects on these outcomes compared to standard practice. It might be that the positive effect of the physical activity programme on those cognitive functions is diluted with increasing complexity of the interventions. The intensity of the physical activity component might be reduced when additional intervention activities, such as healthy lifestyle education sessions, are implemented. Adjustments to the duration and frequency of physical activity programmes might have been required to keep the burden on the school personnel manageable. While interventions with multiple strategies appear successful for obesity prevention and treatment (<xref rid="b72" ref-type="bibr">Al-Khudairy 2017</xref>; <xref rid="b90" ref-type="bibr">Colquitt 2016</xref>; <xref rid="b142" ref-type="bibr">Mead 2017</xref>; <xref rid="b182" ref-type="bibr">Waters 2011</xref>), a sufficient intensity and quality of the effective intervention components might be required for improving cognitive functions. We were not able to provide a similar observation with dietary intervention because none of the included studies applied an intervention without an additional nutrition education programme.</p><p>Given the importance of adequate physical and cognitive development of young children for their later life, further evidence is needed on the effectiveness of physical activity, dietary and other behavioural interventions on cognition and school achievement in the preschool years. In addition, the evidence is insufficient for adolescents who have reached puberty. The effectiveness of obesity-related behaviour change interventions on cognition and school achievement in this age group is of particular importance, because of the direct implications for adult health and socio-economic success of the individual and the nation. The extent to which sex and ethnicity influence the effect of physical activity and dietary interventions on cognition and school achievement in children and adolescents with obesity or overweight remains unknown, and should be addressed in future research.</p><p>Future multicomponent obesity prevention and treatment programmes should consider implementing physical activity programmes which are effective in improving cognitive functions or school achievement.</p><p>Further research is needed in low- and middle-income settings, to establish whether there are differential intervention effects on cognition and school achievement for children and adolescents with obesity or overweight living in socio-economically deprived environments. The educational, societal and economic argument for implementing effective childhood obesity prevention and treatment programmes could be substantial.</p><p>Longer-term follow-up trials are needed to determine whether improvements in school achievement and cognitive function are sustainable over time and thus affect future success. High rates of loss to follow-up assessment are a common problem in lifestyle interventions, particularly those involving children and adolescents with obesity or overweight. To reduce the risk of attrition bias, researchers might wish to consider methods to impute missing outcome data in their analysis and to report characteristics of and reasons for missing data.</p><p>Including brain-imaging techniques might enable researchers to detect beneficial effects on cognition which are not detectable using psychometric tests of academic and cognitive abilities. Finally, more multivariate research is needed to further investigate associations, two-way interactions and causal pathways between childhood obesity, lifestyle behaviour, cognitive abilities and academic outcomes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful to the trial authors who provided unpublished outcome data and additional study details.

"The physical activities were aimed to be of moderate-to-vigorous intensity. During the lessons all children started with performing a basic exercise, such as jogging, hopping in place or marching. A specific exercise was performed when the children solved an academic task. For example, for mathematics, children had to jump 8 times to solve the multiplication &#x02018;42&#x02019;.

The basketballs were used in unconventional ways with varying game rules (e.g. use of foot-eye co-ordination techniques with basketballs).

Classroom teachers offered 30 daily minutes of activity bursts throughout the school year. The activity bursts were designed to include a brief warm-up and cool-down (e.g. stretching or low-intensity activity) along with 1 or more core activities of higher intensity (e.g. hopping, running in place, jumping jacks, or dancing to music). Teachers were provided with an ABC manual with guidelines and activity suggestions. The programme structure was flexible and allowed for teachers to be creative in selecting warm-ups/core activities/cool-downs, determining the timing and length of individual activity bursts, and deciding how best to incorporate them into the school day (i.e. whether as a break from lessons or incorporated into the lessons)."<break/><bold>2.

"For each family kit, students were encouraged to return the completed assignments or logs for a small prize. A family night was held in schools and focused primarily on physical activity: families visited stations throughout the building to try out different kinds of exercises, including Frisbee golf and Zumba, and received information or coupons from local fitness-related businesses."<break/><bold>2. Healthy nutrition/lifestyle education:</bold> As above. "Schools also received articles related to health, nutrition, or physical activity to include in their monthly school newsletters." In addition, "a family-focused kit was sent home which included a Nutrition Detectives DVD; a reminder card with the programme&#x02019;s "five clues" to make healthful food choices; grocery store coupons; and a family "homework assignment" to watch the DVD, review the ND clues together, complete an activity applying the clues to foods in the family kitchen, and informational materials on the NuVal Nutritional Scoring System."

District-wide policies include mandates for daily physical activity and PE and development of policies that prohibit withholding PE for punitive reasons. To further increase physical activity, the School Wellness Policy specifies expanding programmes/activities that meet need, interest, and abilities of students. Exer-gaming consoles will be provided to 6 schools and will be integrated into 5th - 8th grade PE classes and after-school programmes. New and innovate gym equipment will be purchased for the 6 target schools for use in gym class and after-school programming. Various pedometer and interactive programmes encouraging physical activity in and outside of school are planned for the 6th grade<break/><underline>Group 2 - Nutrition only:</underline> Policy changes will focus on 6 target schools. District will expand nutrition education by integrating other opportunities to learn and practice healthy behaviours across disciplines. Farm-to-School programmes will include school visits by farmers to teach students about agriculture, healthy foods and nutrition, coinciding with Farmer's Market Menu Days. Schools will receive 4 45-minute nutrition workshops a year. Community educators will offer culturally appropriate, interactive nutrition workshops and cooking demonstrations. Cafeterias will receive youth-friendly nutritional messaging, regular promotion of new menu foods, and a variety of monthly nutrition-focused activities. The goals are to: increase number of students who try new menu items regularly, increase acceptance of healthy foods, and improve nutrition literacy. Policy states schools will limit celebrations that involve food to no more than 1 per class/month: 6 schools will pilot alternatives to food for celebrations<break/><underline>Group 3 - Physical Activity + Nutrition:</underline> Schools will receive nutrition education, nutrition standards for foods sold, and opportunities for physical activity. In addition to the above interventions, schools (N+PA) will expand the District's school-based wellness initiative, PAW-Physical Activity and Wellness. With District support, PAW schools develop School Wellness Teams (SWTs) to identify school health priorities, implement and sustain health initiatives through school campaigns, promote healthy behaviour, and support wellness policies. SWP addresses health promotion and marketing by limiting product marketing in schools, expanding nutrition education and broadening health communication with parents. In 3 targeted schools, we expand to include Staff Wellness Promotion. Adults in schools are trusted and influential role models for students; by increasing their positive health behaviours, students may be influenced to adopt similar behaviours. The District will work with the City's Employee Wellness Programme to increase school staff participation.<break/><underline>Waitlist-control/standard practice</underline>: Schools will receive educational interventions on health topics not related to nutrition or physical activity (i.e. peer relations, sleep, dental care, etc.)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Outcomes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">School achievement: Standardised test scores in reading and mathematics<break/>Obesity Indices: Body weight and height to calculate BMI</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Notes</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Retrospective trial registration: 20 January 2014<break/>Completion date: June 2016<break/>No publication of intervention results yet.

For families in which 1 parent is obese, this parent will be encouraged to be the participating parent; if both parents are obese, the family will choose 1 parent to enrol in the study. Similarly, if 2 children in the family are obese, the older sibling will be encouraged to be the primary participant, as it is more likely the younger sibling will model the older sibling. Although only the child who is overweight/obese and the participating parent will be required to attend treatment sessions, all family members living in the household, including other adults and siblings, will be encouraged to participate indirectly by supporting changes in the family's lifestyle.

Families in which either the participating child or parent is actively involved in psychological or other interfering weight-loss treatment, using weight-affecting medications, or has a psychiatric or medical condition (e.g. anorexia nervosa, schizophrenia, binge eating disorder, depression) that would hinder participation in the study will be excluded as identified by the screening assessments described in section 5.B.2.

Using the risk ratio rather than the odds ratio minimises misinterpretation of the occurrence of the treatment effect and avoids subsequent conversion of odds ratios to risk ratios for correct interpretation. In the &#x02018;Summary of findings&#x02019; table, we will express dichotomous data as relative (risk ratio) and absolute (number of children per 1000) risk.<break/><bold>Ordinal data</bold><break/>For ordinal data, we will analyse longer ordinal scales (e.g. Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children) as continuous data (Section 9.2.4. in <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>). When studies use short ordinal scales (e.g. A to F classification of educational achievement), we will convert these to dichotomous data by combining adjacent categories and calculating the risk ratio (Section 9.2.4. in <xref rid="b118" ref-type="bibr">Higgins 2011</xref>). Dichotomisation will be done according to the cut-offs considered as &#x02018;pass&#x02019; or &#x02018;fail&#x02019;</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Unit of analysis issues</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Multiple time points</bold><break/>We will analyse data from studies that reported results at more than one time point in a separate meta-analysis with comparable data from other studies at similar time points.

An asymmetrical plot may indicate publication bias or a real relationship between study size and effect size, as when larger trials have lower compliance rates and compliance is positively related to effect size.

</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Differences between protocol and review</title><p>The review title changed to specify the intervention types more precisely, and we used person-first language to remove stigma.</p><p>The author team changed from the protocol to this version of the systematic review. Three new authors joined as co-authors: Josephine N Booth, Yvonne Laird and John J Reilly. Susan Shenkin was not involved in the update of this review.</p><p>We revised the wording in the review objectives in the abstract and main text by providing an example of what we mean by cognitive function in brackets. The wording changed from "cognitive function" to "cognitive function (e.g. executive functions)".</p><p>We intended from the outset to select studies based on inclusion criteria; however, we did not state this explicitly in the protocol. The intervention criterion for inclusion was that the study aimed to prevent or treat childhood and adolescent obesity as a primary or secondary outcome through lifestyle interventions. The outcome criterion for inclusion was that studies measured school achievement, cognitive function and future success as defined in Types of outcome measures. We clarified that we restricted the review to the aforementioned outcome measures because the same interventions were studied in the same population for different purposes, e.g. change in body mass index, and were published recently in three other Cochrane Reviews.</p><p>We stated in the protocol that studies that included some children and adolescents with overweight would be included in the review only when outcomes for children with obesity or overweight were reported separately. Only a few studies investigated the effects of lifestyle interventions on school achievement or cognitive function or both in a paediatric population with overweight; we therefore did not exclude those studies if results for this population group were not reported separately. We made every effort to contact the authors of those studies to obtain data for the subgroup with obesity or overweight, or both.</p><p>In the protocol, we stated that we would include controlled trials. We removed this inclusion criterion and considered only randomised controlled trials, as is was recommended by our Cochrane group.</p><p>We provided effect sizes for studies that were inappropriate for inclusion in a meta-analysis. The protocol stated that we would provide a narrative description of study results derived from those studies.</p><p>We intended from the outset to consider the 'Risk of bias' item &#x02018;Comparability of groups at baseline&#x02019; to assess the extent of the limitation of unclear risk of bias on randomisation on our confidence in the evidence when using GRADE. We did not state this explicitly in the protocol. We did not consider an unclear risk of selection bias as a serious limitation where we rated the 'Risk of bias' item &#x02018;Comparability of groups at baseline&#x02019; as low risk of bias. A low risk of bias in &#x02018;Comparability of groups at baseline&#x02019; may suggest adequate randomisation, so we have confidence in the evidence. However, where we rated &#x02018;Comparability of groups at baseline&#x02019; as being at unclear or high risk of bias, we considered an unclear risk of bias in randomisation as a serious limitation, and therefore downgraded the quality of evidence to reflect our limited confidence in the evidence.</p><p>We have added 'Adverse outcomes' as a primary outcome, and classed 'Cognitive outcomes' as an additional primary outcome.</p><p>We added a section on 'Summary of findings' to the Methods.</p><p>We removed different intervention types from the subgroup analysis and conducted separate comparisons for each intervention type. The increased number of identified studies allowed us to classify 'multicomponent' interventions in more detail.</p><p>At the request of the editorial base, we reported Tau<sup>2</sup> as an indicator of statistical heterogeneity in random-effect models in additional to the I<sup>2</sup> statistic.</p><p>We did not search Open Grey (previously Open Sigle) and MIT CogNet, as they did not yield any records previously. We did not search the database on Obesity and Sedentary Behaviour Studies (EPPI) because the content had not been updated since the previous searches. We searched Dissertation and Thesis Global instead of the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations.</p><p>We extracted change-from-baseline data and entered them in the meta-analysis, instead of post-intervention data, where possible.</p></sec></back></article>

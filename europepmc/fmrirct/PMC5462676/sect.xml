controlled trial (RCT) of neural manual vs. robotic assisted on pain in sensitivity as
well as analyse the quantitative and qualitative movement of hand in subjects with hand
osteoarthritis. [Subjects and Methods] Seventy-two patients, aged 50 to 90 years old of
both genders, with a diagnosis of hand Osteoarthritis (OA), will be recruited. Two groups
of 36 participants will receive an experimental intervention (neurodynamic mobilization
intervention plus exercise) or a control intervention (robotic assisted passive
mobilization plus exercise) for 12 sessions over 4 weeks. Assessment points will be at
baseline, end of therapy, and 1 and 3 months after end of therapy. The outcomes of this
intervention will be pain and determine the central pain processing mechanisms. [Result]
Not applicable. [Conclusion] If there is a reduction in pain hypersensitivity in hand OA
patients it can suggest that supraspinal pain-inhibitory areas, including the
periaqueductal gray matter, can be stimulated by joint mobilization.OsteoarthritisHandRehabilitation<sec xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a double-blind randomized-controlled trial. The patient will sign the informed
consent for study and procedures will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki.
This research protocol has been approved by the Local Ethical Committee of “IRCCS D.G.F”,
Italy on 24 February 2016 and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02701335). This
trial is financed by the National Health System of Italy (Project Code:
GR-2013-02358472).</p><p>Our study will include 72 patients, aged 50 to 90 years old of both genders, with a
diagnosis of hand OA. To ensure the precision of results of this trial, subjects who meet
the following eligible criteria will be included in this study. All subjects will have OA of
the dominant hand. A physiatrist (physician) will establish the diagnosis of hand OA. Each
subject will undergo subjective and physical examination performed by a physical therapist
experienced in musculoskeletal physiotherapy to evaluate inclusion and exclusion criteria.
To be included in the study, the subjects need to have a history of repetitive use of their
dominant hand (eg, ex-factory worker) and a diagnosis of hand OA in the dominant hand,
according on radiographic findings. The exclusion criteria are: if they score greater than 6
points on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or more than 30 points in the State Trait
Anxiety Inventory (STAI)<xref rid="r17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><sup>)</sup>. Patients with
a medical history of carpal tunnel syndrome, surgical interventions to the hand,
DeQuervain’s tenosynovitis, or with degenerative or non-degenerative neurological conditions
in which pain perception is altered will be excluded. None of the individuals in this study
will have received prior interventions for hand OA.</p><p>Recruitment will take place between December 2016 and April 2018. Those who will be
considered eligible for the study will be invited for a first interview at which point
informed written consent will be completed, inclusion and exclusion criteria confirmed, and
a medical history and physical examination will be completed.</p><p>Two groups of thirty participants will receive an experimental intervention (neurodynamic
intervention plus exercise) or a control intervention (robotic assisted passive mobilization
of the hand (Gloreha, Idrogenet, Italy) plus exercise) for 12 sessions over 4 weeks and will
be applied to the dominant hand. The variables will be collected in the following order:
pain and function (measured by the visual analogue scale, [VAS], pressure pain threshold
[PPT] and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Score [QuickDASH] questionnaire).
Nerve conduction (NC) (measured by the electromyography, [EMG]), and hand mobility (measured
by kinematic analysis) will then be assessed. All outcomes measures will be captured at
baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 1- and 3-month post-interventions.</p><p>The present document was prepared according to the editorial form of medical publishing and

a sliding movement of the neural structures in relation to their anatomical adjacent
tissues. A nerve slider is a maneuver producing a sliding movement of the neural structures
in relation to their anatomical adjacent tissues. It involves a combination of movement of
surrounding so that tension on one end of the nerve increases while the tension on the other
end relieves<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the medial nerve, The sequence of movement performed on the patient by the physical
therapist for initial positioning for the nerve slider technique is: shoulder girdle
depression, glenohumeral abduction and external rotation, supination of the forearm, and
wrist, thumb, and finger extension, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1a</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Nerve slider exercise used to target the median, radial and ulnar nerves</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-801-g001"/></fig>). Then, the nerve slider technique for the median nerve consists of alternating i)
the combination of elbow extension (which increases tension on the median nerve) and wrist
flexion (which decreases tension on the median nerve) movement with ii) the combination of
elbow flexion (decreasing tension) and wrist extension (increasing tension) movement. The
imposed range of motion are: i) from 0° to 60° of extension at the wrist, and ii) from 15 to
90° of flexion of the wrist depending on tissue resistance<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>For the radial nerve, the sequence of movement performed on the patient by the physical
therapist for initial positioning consists of shoulder girdle depression, glenohumeral
internal rotation, pronation of the forearm, elbow extension, and wrist, thumb, and finger
flexion<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. Finally, ulnar deviation of
the wrist is added. The slider neurodynamic technique for the radial nerve consists of
alternating the combination of shoulder depression (loads the radial nerve) and elbow
flexion-wrist extension (unloads the radial nerve) with shoulder elevation (unloading) and
elbow-wrist extension (loading) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1b)</xref>.</p><p>Finally, for the ulnar nerve, the wrist is placed in extension, the elbow is flexed and the
shoulder abducted. Sliding technique: elbow extension (unloads the ulnar nerve) and shoulder
abduction (loads the ulnar nerve) is alternated with elbow flexion (loading) and shoulder
adduction (unloading)<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. Throughout the
sliding technique, the wrist is maintained in 60° extension and the forearm in supination
(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_001">Fig. 1c)</xref>.</p><p>The nerves slider technique will be performed twice for 3 minutes each time with a 1-minute
rest between sets. Speed and amplitude of movement are adjusted such that no pain is
produced during the technique.</p><p><italic>Control Intervention.</italic> Each patient will use the Gloreha device for passive
mobilization of the hand twice a day for 4 consecutive weeks. Treatment will include, half
an hour of treatment during the morning with the “program” (each finger is mobilized
individually) and half an hour of treatment during the afternoon with the “synchronous”
(II-III-IV-V finger are mobilized simultaneously, the thumb individually) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig_002">Fig. 2</xref><fig orientation="portrait" fig-type="figure" id="fig_002" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>Hand exercises with Gloreha</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jpts-29-801-g002"/></fig>). The fingers of the patients are hooked to individual thimbles connectable through a
nylon thread to a device fixed on the glove that interfaced with a hybrid system (compressed
air and oil) performing the passive movement of flexion-extension of the fingers. The
presence of these flexible cables allows the Gloreha glove to gradually moderate the
intensity of forces applied on subject’s hand and fingers. The length of every cable can be
adjusted in the aim to guarantee a progressive and specific adaptation of each finger
according to order of the treatment, the type of exercise and the clinical condition of the
subject (level of resistance, pain and etc.).</p><p>Subjects in both groups will receive the same standardized exercise protocol as described
by Villafañe et al<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>. The first 6 exercises
consist of active range of motion movements of the hand designed to improve joint
flexibility. The remaining 3 exercises are designed to strengthen grip and pinch by using a
non-latex polymer ball: the Thera-Band Hand Exerciser (The Hygenic Corporation, Akron, OH,
USA) (<xref rid="tbl_001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Hand exercises</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Exercise</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Tabletop</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">The hand and wrist are held in a neutral position; the subject

Loss of muscle power (force×velocity product) is a dominant physical determinant for loss of functional ability, especially if the lower extremities are affected. Muscle strength training is known to maintain or even improve muscle power as well as physical function in older adults, but the optimal type of training for beneficial long-term training effects over several years is unknown. Moreover, the impact of muscle strength training on cognitive function and brain structure remains speculative. The primary aim of this randomised controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of two different 1 year strength training regimens on immediate and long-lasting improvements in muscle power in retirement-age individuals. Secondary aims are to evaluate the effect on muscle strength, muscle mass, physical and cognitive function, mental well-being, health-related quality of life and brain morphology.Methods and analysisThe study includes 450 home-dwelling men and women (62–70 years). Participants are randomly allocated to (1) 1 year of supervised, centre-based heavy resistance training, (2) home-based moderate intensity resistance training or (3) habitual physical activity (control). Changes in primary (leg extensor power) and secondary outcomes are analysed according to the intention to treat principle and per protocol at 1, 2, 4, 7 and 10 years.Ethics and disseminationThe study is expected to generate new insights into training-induced promotion of functional ability and independency after retirement and will help to formulate national recommendations regarding physical activity schemes for the growing population of older individuals in western societies. Results will be published in scientific peer-reviewed journals, in PhD theses and at public meetings. The study is approved by the Regional Ethical Committee (Capital Region, Copenhagen, Denmark, number H-3-2014-017).Trial registration numberNCT02123641.Strength trainingOlder adultsPhysical functionCognitive functionMental well-beingNordea-fondenhttp://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004825Strengths and limitations of this studyThe LIve active Successful Ageing (LISA) study is the first randomised and supervised 1 year strength training study performed on older adults close to retirement age with a planned long-term follow-up period (2, 4, 7 and 10 years).We include a relatively large cohort (450), which makes it possible to detect even smaller significant changes on a large battery of important health-related physical, cognitive and mental outcomes.Men and women, healthy and those with a certain degree of chronic diseases, are allowed to participate, which strengthens the external validity of the study but at the same time may introduce a larger variation in the results.Detailed analyses at the molecular level are not carried out, but subgroup studies of more mechanistic, invasive nature are allowed after approval by the ethical committee and the project steering group.BackgroundPhysical inactivity and high age are associated with increased mortality and morbidity in humans.1–3 A significant proportion of older adults do not meet the physical activity recommendations required to reduce morbidity and maintain functional ability.4
5 Skeletal muscle mass and strength decline gradually by 2% each year from the sixth decade6 adversely affecting activities of daily living in 30% of all individuals over the age of 70.6–10 Importantly, there is an even more pronounced age-related loss of muscle power (muscle force×velocity product), declining by 3–3.5% each year from the age of 50–60 years,11 which is known to be more closely associated with the decline in functional ability than the mere loss of muscle mass and strength.11–14Several factors influence the age-related loss of muscle function, but especially a gradual decline in physical activity observed in older adults appears to be important.7
15 Additionally, acute reductions of physical activity in older individuals can accelerate the age-related decline in muscle mass and function. Immobilisation, due to bed rest or hospitalisation, results in a very fast and pronounced loss of muscle power (14% in 10 days),16 and muscle mass (4–6 days), which is only slowly and insufficiently regained during rehabilitation.17Transitions in life circumstances such as retirement pose a challenge to many people and may change the pattern of physical activity.18–20 Studies investigating the actual changes in physical activity level after retirement have shown inconsistent results.21–24 The inconsistency may be related to differences in socioeconomic status and previous profession, which are known to influence physical activity after retirement.25–29 Little is known about individual factors influencing physical activity after retirement, but individual personality traits may have impact on the level of physical activity.30Systematic reviews of exercise interventions for promoting physical activity level in middle-aged to elderly individuals have shown moderate effects over 6–12 months of intervention,31
32 whereas knowledge about longer lasting (&gt;12 months) effects is sparse. A meta-analysis of training studies performed on 55–70 year old individuals demonstrated good effect of physical activity and lifestyle interventions on physical activity level at termination of 12 months intervention,33 but it was unclear whether this effect lasted beyond the intervention. Only 1 of 15 trials in the meta-analysis used an accelerometer as assessment tool, and that study could not demonstrate any increase in daily activity after 12 months training,34 or at a 12-month postintervention follow-up. To date, no exercise intervention has thus proven to be effectively increasing or maintaining a high daily physical activity level beyond the intervention period.Supervised centre-based heavy resistance exercise has proven to be effective with regard to increasing muscle mass and strength in healthy older adults35 as well as in patients with osteoarthritis36 and to reduce physical limitations.37 However, training-related discomfort and side-effects such as injuries may increase the risk of participants dropping out of the study. In fact, it has been shown that after termination of a supervised training intervention of 2–3 months only few people continue this type of training.38–40 Resistance training at moderate intensity, targeting only 60% of one repetition maximum has shown to increase muscle protein synthesis in older individuals and this metabolic parameter, which mediates muscle hypertrophy, seems to be more dependent on training volume than on training intensity per se.41
42 Improvement in muscle power may also be obtained at lower training loads but with a higher velocity of contraction.43
44 Thus, moderate intensity types of exercise may lead to gains in muscle mass as well as muscle power and overall function in older individuals that are comparable to classic heavy resistance training (HRT). Whether such improvements are maintained over several years remains to be investigated in a long-term follow-up study.Physical activity in retirement-aged individuals has been associated with improvements in several mental characteristics including cognition,45
46 depressive states47
48 and health-related quality of life.49 A randomised study50 reported that two types of training programmes (strength and flexibility exercise) both had positive effects on different aspects of functioning and mental well-being in individuals aged 65 years or older. For both training programmes, individuals showed better adherence to the home-based training sessions compared with the class-based sessions. Thus, it is possible that individuals at retirement-age are more prone to implement and adhere to exercise in their daily lives after a home-based moderate intensity training intervention with periodic supervision than after a centre-based HRT intervention, but this remains to be compared directly in a long-term follow-up study.Like the muscles, the brain is subject to age-related atrophy, resulting in shrinkage of brain volume, decrease in cortical thickness, surface area and gyrification, as well as increase in ventricular volume.51
52 Changes in white matter microstructure are accelerating from the sixth decade53 affecting the integrity of the white matter connections, disrupting neural integration in functional brain networks54 and affecting cognitive function.55
56 Although a recent meta-analysis did not find evidence that cognitive function benefit from aerobic physical activities several studies have shown that regular physical activity increases plasticity of the brain57
58 and has beneficial effects on brain structure and function,45
59
60 which parallel improvement in muscle structure and physical function.61Ageing is associated with accumulation of cardiovascular risk factors impairing cerebral vascular and metabolic functions.62 Physically fit older adults have been shown to have lower blood pressures and higher cerebrovascular reserve.45
63
64 A recent study supports the notion that cardiovascular exercise may be an efficient way to modulate vascular changes and improve cognitive health in later life65 potentially mediated through higher levels of white matter microstructural organisation.66 Yet it still remains to be clarified whether training at retirement-age exerts long-lasting beneficial effects on brain structure and function and if so, which type of training is effectively delaying or even preventing age-related cognitive decline.AimsThe LIve active Successful Ageing (LISA) study is a cross-disciplinary approach to ageing research aiming to understand and find ways to delay or even reverse the age-related decline of physical and cognitive function. The primary aim is to compare the immediate and long-term (2–10 years) efficacy of two different 1 year resistance training interventions (high intensity vs moderate intensity) with a non-exercising control group in moderately old individuals close to retirement-age (62–70 years) on the following outcomes:
Primary outcome: leg extensor power.Secondary outcomes: muscle strength, muscle mass, functional ability, daily level of physical activity, health-related quality of life, mental distress, personality, adherence to training, cognitive ability, MRI brain imaging parameters.HypothesesThe trial evaluates the following hypotheses:
Compared to a control group, 1 year of heavy or moderate intensity resistance training improves leg extensor power. HRT is superior to moderate intensity resistance training with respect to improvements in muscle power.In long-term follow-ups (2–10 years), moderate intensity training is associated with higher general physical activity level and is comparable or even superior to high intensity resistance training with respect to maintenance of muscle power, muscle strength, muscle mass and functional ability.Compared to a control group, both training interventions are associated with immediate and long-term increase in quality of life and a decrease in mental distress.Compared to a control group, both training interventions are associated with greater hippocampal and prefrontal cortex volumes.Higher 400 m walking performance is at all time points associated with higher levels of white matter microstructural organisation (fractional anisotropy, FA).Cognitive ability and personality predict short-term and long-term adherence to intervention programmes and changes in physical activity level.Irrespective of intervention type, follow-up measures of quality of life, mental distress, cognitive ability and changes on MRI scans are associated with the amount of physical activity.<sec xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study design</title><p>The LISA study is an efficacy study and will be conducted as a single-blinded (outcome assessors) single centre, multidisciplinary, randomised controlled trial with a parallel group design.

<xref rid="R79" ref-type="bibr">79</xref> is a 90 item inventory used to assess a wide range of mental symptoms. For the purpose of the LISA study, a shorter 35 items version is used to assess symptoms on the three subscales of somatisation, depression and anxiety. In addition, the General Severity Index (GSI), indicating number and severity of symptoms, is calculated as the mean item score across the three subscales.

<xref rid="R81" ref-type="bibr">81</xref> is used to assess the participants' health-related quality of life within the last week. The SF-36 consists of 36 items and obtains information on eight aspects of health-related quality of life including physical function, physical role, physical pain, general health, vitality, social function, emotional role and mental health, with the former four subscales contributing to a physical component and the latter four subscales contributing to a mental component. Raw scores are transformed to range from 0 to 100 with 100 reflecting highest level of health-related quality of life.</p></sec><sec id="s4e5e"><title>Physical activity</title><p>The Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)<xref rid="R82" ref-type="bibr">82</xref> is used to obtain information on self-reported physical activity among the participants. PASE is an instrument developed specifically for individuals aged 65 years or older and measures level of physical activity over a 1-week period. The instrument consists of 12 items assessing three areas of physical activity including leisure-time physical activity, work-related physical activity and household physical activity. On the basis of frequency, duration and intensity level of each area of activity, a total PASE score is derived, which represents the overall activity level with 0 indicating total inactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4e5f"><title>Exercise self-efficacy</title><p>The Confidence Self-efficacy Scale<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83</xref> is used to measure the participants' self-efficacy with regard to physical activity. Judgements of self-efficacy expectations are thought to play an important role in determining whether an individual performs a given behaviour and the degree of effort the individual invests in the behaviour.<xref rid="R84" ref-type="bibr">84</xref> The Confidence Self-efficacy Scale consists of five items assessing how confident the participants are with regard to being physically active in different situations such as ‘When I am tired’ or ‘When I am on vacation’. Physical activity includes activities such as walking briskly, jogging, bicycling, swimming and other activities with a similar level of exertion. Questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from 1 (‘not at all confident’) to 5 (‘extremely confident’). The total score is calculated as the sum of the 5 items and range from 5 to 25 with a higher score indicating more exercise self-efficacy.</p></sec><sec id="s4e5g"><title>Attitude to intervention</title><p>The Attitudes to Falls-Related Interventions Scale (AFRIS)<xref rid="R85" ref-type="bibr">85</xref> is used to address the participants' attitude to the intervention. The questionnaire is based on the ‘Theory of planned behaviour’,<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref> which indicates how attitudes and beliefs can predict intentions and behaviour. AFRIS comprises 6 items assessing the core components of ‘Theory of planned behaviour’ including expectations to the objective outcome (item 1), expectations to the subjective experience (item 2), beliefs about the attitude of important others (item 3), perceived behavioural control (item 4), identity (item 5) and intention (item 6). Each item is scored from 1 (disagree strongly) to 6 (agree strongly) and thus the total scale score ranges from 6 to 36 with a higher score indicating a more positive attitude to the intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4e5h"><title>Adherence</title><p>Currently, there seems to be a lack of consensus on how to assess exercise adherence.<xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> In the present study, adherence is defined as the extent to which the participant has continued the assigned intervention. The adherence measurement tool is a questionnaire developed by the authors specifically for the LISA project. The questionnaire asks about how long the participant has continued the intervention since the last assessment, the weekly frequency of training sessions and the extent to which the participant has performed the same exercises. The questions are answered on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘never’/‘not at all’ to ‘all the time’/‘more than three times a week’, respectively. Participants are also asked to evaluate the contribution of different reasons for continuing or discontinuing the intervention on a 5-point scale ranging from ‘did not contribute’/‘no significance’ to ‘contributed a lot’/‘very significant’. Adherence is also evaluated indirectly by the PASE questionnaire and the ActivPal accelerometer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4e6"><title>Physical testing</title><p>Trained assessors blinded to the allocation and the participants previous test results perform the following physical tests in the same order at baseline and follow-up.</p><sec id="s4e6a"><title>400 m walk test</title><p>The 400 m walk test assesses walking endurance.

When estimating sample size, we wished to be able to detect an overall group difference in leg extensor power changes based on one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and also to detect differences in post hoc pairwise group comparisons. We chose a power level of 80% and a significance level of 0.05 for the ANOVA model and a Bonferroni corrected significance level of 0.05/3=0.016 for the pairwise comparisons. On the basis of previous research,<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>
<xref rid="R96" ref-type="bibr">96–99</xref> we expected a realistic 10% difference in the improvements in leg extensor power between groups at 1 year (ie, control group: 175–184 w (+5%), MIT: 175–202 w (10% more than control), HRT: 175–222 (10% more than MIT)). A recent meta-analysis supported this, since they found a 10% increase in leg extensor power to be clinically relevant at least in mobility-limited older adults.<xref rid="R100" ref-type="bibr">100</xref> With an estimated SD of the improvement in leg extensor power of 30, we needed 60 participants in each group to detect pairwise group differences of 10%. We have chosen to include 150 participants in each group, which will enable us to detect smaller groups differences and larger variations in secondary outcomes. Further, with an estimated loss to follow-up of 50% over a 10-year period, we will still be able to detect a 10% group difference in the per protocol analysis of the primary outcome.</p><p>Descriptive statistics of baseline data will be presented as means±SDs. Changes in the primary outcome (leg extensor power) at 12 months will be compared between groups using one-way ANOVA with post hoc pairwise comparisons. The intention to treat principle will be applied, and advanced multiple imputation techniques will be used to account for missing data. Secondary outcomes will be analysed by appropriate statistical tests depending on the nature of the specific outcome measure.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Risks, disadvantages and adverse events</title><p>The disadvantages and risk of adverse events in the present study are considered low. Blood samples are drawn from the antecubital vein after disinfection with alcohol swabs. There is a minimal risk of infection and bleeding related to the procedure. In relation to training, there is a risk of developing delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) following training,<xref rid="R101" ref-type="bibr">101</xref> especially in the beginning of the intervention. DOMS can be uncomfortable, but is entirely safe and diminishes after acclimatisation to training.</p><p>There is a small risk of injury related to both resistance training interventions. Pain or discomfort in relation to the HRT or MIT exercises is initially dealt with by adjusting the exercise or training volume and intensity. In cases of acute injury or persistent symptoms of overload, participants are offered a consultation with an experienced sports physician (orthopaedic surgeon or rheumatologist) at the Institute of Sports Medicine Copenhagen. Pausation, temporary adjustment of exercises or discontinuation of the intervention is decided in collaboration between the physician, study staff and the participant and will be reported.

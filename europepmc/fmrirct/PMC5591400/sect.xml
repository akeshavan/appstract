These treatments, including repetitive task practice (RTP), robotically assisted rehabilitation and virtual rehabilitation activities, produce improvements in hand function but have yet to reinstate function to pre-stroke levels—which likely depends on developing the therapies to impact cortical reorganization in a manner that favors or supports recovery. Understanding cortical reorganization that underlies the above interventions is therefore critical to inform how such therapies can be utilized and improved and is the focus of the current investigation. Specifically, we compare neural reorganization elicited in stroke patients participating in two interventions: a hybrid of robot-assisted virtual reality (RAVR) rehabilitation training and a program of RTP training. Ten chronic stroke subjects participated in eight 3-h sessions of RAVR therapy. Another group of nine stroke subjects participated in eight sessions of matched RTP therapy. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired during paretic hand movement, before and after training. We compared the difference between groups and sessions (before and after training) in terms of BOLD intensity, laterality index of activation in sensorimotor areas, and the effective connectivity between ipsilesional motor cortex (iMC), contralesional motor cortex, ipsilesional primary somatosensory cortex (iS1), ipsilesional ventral premotor area (iPMv), and ipsilesional supplementary motor area. Last, we analyzed the relationship between changes in fMRI data and functional improvement measured by the Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT), in an attempt to identify how neurophysiological changes are related to motor improvement. Subjects in both groups demonstrated motor recovery after training, but fMRI data revealed RAVR-specific changes in neural reorganization patterns. First, BOLD signal in multiple regions of interest was reduced and re-lateralized to the ipsilesional side. Second, these changes correlated with improvement in JTHFT scores. Our findings suggest that RAVR training may lead to different neurophysiological changes when compared with traditional therapy. This effect may be attributed to the influence that augmented visual and haptic feedback during RAVR training exerts over higher-order somatosensory and visuomotor areas.strokevirtual realityrehabilitationmotor control and learning/plasticityfunctional magnetic resonance imaging neuroimagingconnectivity analysisNational Institutes of Health10.13039/100000002R01NS085122, 1K01HD0559983, R01HD58301National Institute on Disability, Independent Living, and Rehabilitation Research10.13039/10000915790RE5021<sec xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Data for a total of 19 subjects, who participated in a previous non-randomized controlled trial (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>) and who were eligible for MRI, were analyzed to study neural reorganization associated with each type of therapy.

All subjects had ischemic stroke except S7 in the RTP group, whose stroke was hemorrhagic. Inclusion criteria included (1) age between 18 and 80 years, (2) chronic phase of stroke (&gt;6 months), (3) at least 20° of active wrist extension, (4) at least 10° of active finger extension, and (5) meeting safety standards for participating in fMRI. Exclusion criteria included (1) aphasia that would limit the ability to follow verbal instructions, (2) spatial neglect rendering a patient unable to interact with a 28-inch wide workspace and with the robot safely, and (3) participation in other upper extremity therapies during the study. Subjects for the RTP group of the study were recruited consecutively in a period of few months, while subjects in the RAVR group were chosen from a larger sample of subjects participating in a study of virtually simulated UE rehabilitation based on eligibility to participate in MRI testing.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Subjects’ clinical information.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Group</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Subject</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Months since CVA</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CVA side</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CMA</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CMH</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ashworth</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion location</th><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion volume (mm<sup>3</sup>)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Virtual reality (VR)</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">R</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4</td><td align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C;

Initiation and termination cues were provided by displaying the text cues “Go” or “Rest,” respectively. Two MRI-compatible fiber-optic instrumented gloves (5DT) were used to record 14 joint angles of both hands in real time to track finger flexion. Streaming data from the data gloves animated VR hand models displayed on the screen, thereby providing subjects with real-time visual feedback of their movement (<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Subjects were cued to flex their fingers to meet a set of two visual targets, angled at 40 and 80% of their maximum range of motion, in a VR simulation. Prior to the experiment, each subject’s active range of finger motion was evaluated in order to set the targets’ angle properly. On each virtual hand, one arrow pointed to the starting position (hand open) and another pointed to the target (either 40 or 80% of the active range of motion). The starting position target prompted the subjects to return to the same starting position after each trial, and the goal target ensured that subjects were engaged in the experiment and performed consistent movements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>C). Non-paretic hand movement was also recorded to identify any uninstructed or mirror movements that could confound the fMRI results. The task trials’ (16 trials per target, 32 total) duration was 3 s; the trials were randomly interleaved within each functional run with inter-trial rest periods jittered and ranging in duration from 3 to 7 s.

Each subject’s functional volume was manually re-oriented to the AC-PC line, realigned to the first volume, and co-registered with the structural image. Realignment to the first volume showed that motion did not exceed 3 mm in all <italic>X, Y</italic>, or <italic>Z</italic> directions, in all subjects’ datasets; therefore, no data were excluded based on motion artifacts. Stroke lesions were mapped in MRIcron using the high-resolution structural image, and unified segmentation (<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) was used to segment structural images after masking out the lesioned area.

The regions of interests were picked from the average move &gt; rest contrast in each group.

This full model was estimated (in SPM8, DCM10) for each of the datasets. DCM A parameters represent the endogenous connectivity between nodes in the full model, and B parameters represent the modulation (increase or decrease) of this endogenous connectivity during the moving task. A and B parameters were added, and the DCM (A + B) parameters were compared between the two testing days and between the two groups using non-parametric Mann–Whitney <italic>U</italic> test.

At baseline, there was no statistical difference in the JTHFT between the two groups (Z = −0.41, p = 0.68). Both groups showed improvement in the JTHFT score, with the percentage change reaching statistical significance in the RAVR (Z = −2.8, p = 0.005) but not in the RTP group. There was no significant between-group difference in the change in JTHFT scores.Table 2Percent change in Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test (JTHFT) score in both groups.GroupSubjectJTHFT% diffVirtual reality (VR)103.9VR209.7VR311.1VR430.7VR506.4VR613.9VR710.3VR810.0VR916.2VR1003.2Mean (SD)11.54 (±7.86)Repetitive task practice (RTP)109.5RTP2−03.2RTP327.5RTP419.6RTP517.5RTP623.9RTP7−06.1RTP829.4RTP9−23.6Mean (SD)10.5 (±17.97)Movement Performance during fMRIRepeated measures ANOVA showed no significant difference in movement kinematics (movement amplitude and duration) during the fMRI task between the two testing days and between the groups, suggesting that subjects performed similarly consistent movements during fMRI. Thus, any differences in brain activation (across days or groups) are unlikely to be attributed to in-scan performance but rather due to training-induced patterns in activation.Between-Group and Within-Group Comparisons of fMRI Data across SessionsChange in Extent and Magnitude of ActivationThe SwE toolbox (53), for non-parametric contrast comparisons, was used to analyze changes in activation magnitude for factors: training group and test time. The activation magnitude in the cerebellum, left temporal lobe, and right precentral gyrus was significantly reduced after RAVR-based training (Figure 2A, Table 3) but did not change in the RTP group (not shown). Figure 2B shows that there was also a significant decrease in the extent of activity in the RAVR group after training (Mann–Whitney U test, Z = −2.894, p = 0.0038) but did not significantly change in the RTP group (Mann–Whitney U test, Z = −1.04, p = 0.296).Figure 2(A) Within-subject non-parametric ANOVA test comparing pre-test and post-test functional magnetic resonance imaging BOLD signals (robot-assisted virtual reality group, family-wise error corrected p &lt; 0.05).

In column 1, l. stands for lobule, g. stands for gyrus, mid. stands for middle, and sup. stands for superior.Interhemispheric DominanceInterhemispheric dominance (44, 45), also referred to as a LI, represents a measure of which hemisphere is predominantly active over the other hemisphere, with a value of 0 representing equal activation, positive values representing greater activity contralesionally, and negative values representing greater activity ipsilesionally. Figure 3 shows considerable variability at the individual subject level in the pre-to-post changes in interhemispheric dominance; some subjects exhibited decreases in dominance of the contralesional hemisphere, while others exhibited increases in dominance of the ipsilesional hemisphere. This result is noteworthy, however, in the sense that both patterns represent a reduction of the dominance in the contralesional hemisphere—either bringing the balance closer to 0 between the two hemispheres after training or facilitating the dominance of the ipsilesional hemisphere. The change in LI after training was significantly different between groups (RAVR group LI median = −0.125, RTP group LI median = 0.07, Z = −2.21, p = 0.027), knowing that the baseline LI values were not significantly different between groups (Z = −1.68, p = 0.09).Figure 3Change in laterality index in the repetitive task practice and the robot-assisted virtual reality groups.Change in Functional Connectivity with iMCThe connectivity maps with iMC as the seed region exhibited increases and decreases across different subjects. No significant difference between groups, or between the two testing days for both groups, and the pattern of change in the connectivity map for iMC was not related to lesion side (right or left), lesion site (cortical or subcortical), or impairment severity.Change in Effective ConnectivityDCM parameters showed varying patterns of change across subjects of both groups. Figure 4A shows the DCM model that was tested for the effective connectivity analysis. Figure 4B shows the change in DCM parameters for both groups, including connectivity parameters from cMC, iPMv, iSMA, and iS1 to iMC. In the RAVR group, DCM connectivity parameters became consistently facilitatory subsequent to training, with facilitation of iMC by iS1 significantly increasing after training (Z = −2.07, p = 0.038). In the RTP group, none of the effective connectivity parameters changed significantly after training.Figure 4(A) DCM full model used to study connectivity between contralesional motor cortex, iS1, ipsilesional supplementary motor area, iPMv, and iM1. (B) Average change in DCM parameters (A + B) in both groups for each connectivity edge. Error bars show the SD. * denotes statistically significant difference.Relationship between Neurophysiological and Clinical MeasuresRelationship to Activation ExtentWe explored the relationship between clinical outcomes and magnitude of brain activation for both groups by performing a regression analysis (using non-parametric Spearman rank correlation) between the ratio of change in the beta values of brain activation for seven ROIs (bilateral premotor, sensory, and motor areas and iSMA) and the ratio of change in JTHFT scores, final JTHFT scores after training, and lesion volume. The ROIs were selected based on the main contrast (move versus rest, combining both testing sessions) and on their anatomical location and role in sensorimotor control. We noted a significant correlation in the RAVR group but not in the RTP group for iMC (rho = −0.78, p = 0.0061), ventral premotor area (iPMv) (rho = −0.77, p = 0.009), and bilateral primary sensory areas [iS1 (rho = −0.79, p = 0.0006) and cS1 (rho = −0.85, p = 0.006)] (see Figure 5).Figure 5Regression analysis, the correlation between changes in BOLD signal beta signals, and ratio of change in Jebsen Taylor Hand Function Test in the robot-assisted virtual reality group. Solid lines show the fit of the data to shown equations.Relationship to Interhemispheric DominanceCombining the RAVR and RTP group data showed a positive correlation between the shift in LI toward the ipsilesional hemisphere (difference in LI between post-test and pre-test) and improvement in the clinical score (rho = 0.47, p = 0.048). The relationship between interhemispheric dominance and the change in JTHFT was not statistically significant within each group.Relationship to Functional and Effective Connectivity of iMCWe found no significant relationship between the change in functional connectivity with iMC and the change in JTHFT after training, or with the lesion volume in both groups. Similarly, we found no significant correlation between the changes in DCM parameters and change in JTFHT. However, we did note that the change in DCM parameters from iS1 to iM1 significantly correlated with the post-test JTFHT score (rho = 0.73, p = 0.03), suggesting that there may be some importance to the connection between sensory and motor cortex in predicting the level of recovery.ConclusionWe found different patterns of reorganization for each group, with the RAVR group changes correlating with better improvement on clinical measures. The patterns of brain reorganization suggest that clinical improvement in the RTP group might have been driven by an adaptive compensatory process in the contralesional hemisphere, while improvement in the RAVR group may have been attributed more to reinstatement of activity of ipsilesional sensorimotor networks. As is often the case, there was no consistent single pattern of recovery exhibited by every subject, highlighting the need to understand patient-specific effects of interventions. However, the neural reorganization that was observed in the RAVR group was generally in line with expected patterns of recovery and suggests that VR and robotic assisted training may be a viable means of providing therapy to reinstate desirable changes in the brain.Ethics StatementAll subjects provided written and verbal informed consents approved by Institutional Review Boards of the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University prior to participating.Author ContributionsSS did the fMRI data collection and data analysis and worked with SA and ET on disseminating the findings and with GF, SA, and ET on writing the manuscript.

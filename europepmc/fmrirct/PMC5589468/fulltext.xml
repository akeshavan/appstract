The RCT study design mitigated ascertainment bias by randomizing patients to receive either duloxetine or placebo, and it supported true causal inferences about treatment effects on the brain by controlling treatment assignment experimentally. We acquired 121 anatomical scans: at baseline and endpoint in 41 patients, and once in 39 healthy controls. At baseline, patients had diffusely thicker cortices than did healthy participants, and patients who had thicker cortices had proportionately less severe symptoms. During the trial, symptoms improved significantly more in medication- compared with placebo-treated patients; concurrently, thicknesses in medication-treated patients declined toward values in healthy controls, but they increased slightly, away from control values, in placebo-treated patients. Changes in symptom severity during the trial mediated the association of treatment assignment with the change in thickness, suggesting that the beneficial effects of medication on symptom severity were at least partially responsible for normalizing cortical thickness. Together our findings suggest that baseline cortical hypertrophy in medication-free patients likely represented a compensatory, neuroplastic response that attenuated symptom severity. Medication then reduced symptoms and lessened the need for compensation, thereby normalizing thickness. This is to the best of our knowledge the first study to report within an RCT a differential change in cortical morphology during medication treatment for depressive illness and the first to provide within an RCT <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for the presence of neuroanatomical plasticity in humans.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p id="P2">Dysthymic disorder (DD) is a chronic but comparatively less severe form of Persistent Depressive Disorder that affects approximately 5% of the US population(<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). DD is characterized by the presence of depressed mood most of the time for 2 or more years accompanied by at least two additional depressive symptoms, including poor self-esteem, low energy, feelings of hopelessness, insomnia, poor appetite, or impaired concentration(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Compared with patients who have episodic Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), DD has been associated with greater childhood adversity, more psychosocial impairment, greater suicidality(<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>), fewer disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and elevated cytokines(<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). DD and MDD patients, however, respond similarly to medications(<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and more than 60% of DD patients have a lifetime history of MDD(<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). A comprehensive analysis of self-reported depressive symptoms suggests a latent continuum of symptoms across all forms of unipolar depression(<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). Thus the preponderance of evidence suggests that DD and MDD lie along a phenotypic and pathophysiological continuum, although whether they also constitute a continuum at the level of brain architecture and function is unknown, as no imaging studies have yet compared brain measures across DD and MDD participants at the same time and using the same image processing techniques.</p><p id="P3">Prior magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of MDD have reported abnormalities in brain regions involved in mood regulation, emotional processing, memory formation, and decision-making, particularly larger volumes and greater activity in the amygdala and reduced volumes in orbitofrontal, subgenual prefrontal(<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), and prefrontal(<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>) cortices, and in the hippocampus(<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). We previously showed that individuals at high compared with low familial risk for MDD had thinner cortices across the entire lateral aspect of the right and mesial wall of the left hemisphere; individuals who actually developed depression had additional thinning of the lateral aspect of the left hemisphere(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Consistent with studies in MDD, the few neuroimaging studies in DD have also implicated abnormalities in brain regions that regulate mood, including enlarged amygdala(<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), increased amygdala activation(<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>), and increased functional connectivity in the default-mode network(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). No studies of DD thus far have assessed measures of cortical thickness compared to values in healthy control participants.</p><p id="P4">A serious and pervasive limitation of nearly all prior brain imaging studies has been their use of a case-control design, which renders studies vulnerable to a wide range of ascertainment biases in the selection of participants. Most importantly, the absence of control over experimental variables renders case-control studies merely associational and incapable of supporting causal inferences concerning mechanisms of pathogenesis or treatment response(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). The most common independent variable studied in case-control designs is diagnosis (e.g. MDD vs control), which in humans ethically cannot be controlled experimentally. One variable that can be controlled in human studies, however, is treatment assignment. Experimental control of intervention through randomization and double blinding in treatment(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) or prevention studies(<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) is why the randomized controlled trial (RCT) has become the gold standard for demonstrating that the experimentally controlled variable, such as treatment assignment, influences an outcome variable, such as symptom severity. A placebo arm in addition controls for non-specific treatment effects. We can understand the causal influences of treatment on the brain by using the change in brain imaging measures instead of the change in symptoms as the primary outcome measure in an RCT. This requires acquisition of images at the beginning and end of the RCT, then analyzing those images while blind to treatment assignment and time point of image acquisition (i.e., the beginning or end of the trial). Yoking imaging to an RCT study design in this way mitigates the problem of ascertainment bias that vitiates case-control studies, because patients are randomly assigned to the treatment arms, and most importantly it supports true causal inferences about the effects that the experimentally controlled treatment has on the brain.</p><p id="P5">We yoked anatomical MRI to a 10-week, prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled RCT of the use of antidepressant duloxetine for treating DD(<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>), which permitted us to ascribe the effects of antidepressant medication on cortical thickness. We acquired MRI scans in dysthymic patients both at baseline and end of the trial. We also acquired scans in age- and sex-matched heathy participants at a single point in time to assess whether the medication in DD patients changed cortical thickness towards or away from healthy values. We previously showed in a larger clinical trial of 57 dysthymic patients that duloxetine treatment produced a greater reduction in symptoms than did placebo, and that a greater number of duloxetine- compared to placebo-treated patients experienced remission of symptoms by the end of the trial(<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). We also reported in the same subsample as the present study that duloxetine treatment normalized resting-state BOLD fMRI activity in an otherwise hyperactive default-mode network, especially in the functional interactions between the posterior cingulate cortex and amygdala(<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). We wanted to determine for the same participants as those in the fMRI study whether duloxetine treatment for 10 weeks changes brain structure and, if it does, how those changes relate to changes in symptom severity. Based on our prior resting state fMRI findings, we hypothesized that duloxetine treatment would normalize baseline alterations of cortical thickness in DD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|subjects|methods" id="S2"><title>MATERIALS/SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p id="P6">See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplemental Information</xref> for further details of participant recruitment and characterization, image processing, statistical modeling, and results.

All provided informed written consent prior to participation. Three patients dropped out before the start of the trial, and therefore at baseline we treated and acquired clinical and behavioral data in 57 patients. Of these 57 patients, 53 were consented for MRI at baseline. However, 11 patients declined to have an MRI scan at the end of the trial, and the MRI data for 1 patient had motion artifact, leaving 41 patients who had MRI data at both baseline and end of the study. At the time of recruitment, 22 patients were medication-na&#x000ef;ve; another 15 had discontinued medication use for more than a year. Four patients who were taking psychotropic medications underwent a 4-week medication wash-out prior to participation. We also acquired MRI data at one time point in 39 healthy participants who were group-matched to the patients on age and sex, and who were recruited through mailings and phone calls to households identified in telemarketing lists of the local community. DD patients were diagnosed by a board certified psychiatrist using clinical interviews and the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID).(<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) Patients met DSM-IV-TR(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>) criteria for either dysthymic disorder (DD) or Depressive Disorder not otherwise specified, but they did not meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

Thickening was present in patients randomized to either treatment arm (not shown). The associations of cortical thickness with DD did not change when controlling for prior MDD (not shown), suggesting that prior MDD did not influence the effects of depressive illness on cortical morphology.

Combining brain imaging with an RCT study design allowed us to infer that medication treatment not only was associated with changes in brain structure in DD patients, but it also allowed us to conclude that medication actually caused those changes. Inclusion of healthy controls allowed us to determine whether the treatment-related changes in brain structure were toward or away from normal values. We found that the cortex at the beginning of the trial was significantly and diffusely thicker in DD patients than in healthy participants. Moreover, the baseline thickening was associated with less severe depressive symptoms, suggesting that the thickening may have been a neuroplastic response to illness that served a compensatory function in this patient population. Although symptom severity declined in both treatment arms over the course of the trial, the duloxetine-treated patients improved to a significantly greater extent, and more frequently achieved clinical remission, than did placebo-treated patients. The cortex thinned significantly during the trial in duloxetine-treated patients in the direction of healthy control values, whereas the cortex thickened slightly in placebo-treated patients, diverging even further from healthy values at baseline. We also showed that the change in symptom severity mediated the association of treatment assignment with the change in cortical thickness during the trial, suggesting that medication exerted its normalizing effects on cortical thickness by reducing the severity of symptoms, and supporting further our interpretation that baseline thickening in DD patients was a neuroplastic compensation to chronic illness. When medication successfully reduced symptoms, this putative neuroplastic compensation was no longer needed, which presumably then permitted the return of cortical thickness toward normal values. Finally, we showed that younger compared with older patients had more prominent cortical thinning, and across larger expanses of the cortical surface over the course of the trial (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 2</xref>), suggesting that medication was more effective at normalizing cortical thickness in younger patients.</p><p id="P27">At baseline when they were medication-free, patients had cortices that were diffusely thicker than in the healthy participants, an effect that did not differ between patients randomized to the duloxetine or placebo arms. These findings are consistent with those in recent studies reporting thicker cortices across several brain regions in medication-naive adults with MDD(<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). We also detected cortical thinning in the lateral and mesial prefrontal cortices, consistent with the majority of anatomical studies of MDD reporting thinner cortices in brain regions that support emotion regulation, including orbitofrontal, dorsal anterolateral, and ventrolateral prefrontal cortices(<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>). Our findings, however, could initially seem at odds with our previously reported findings that individuals at high, compared with low, familial risk for MDD have thinner cortices across the entire lateral aspect of the right hemisphere and mesial wall of the left hemisphere(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). It seems likely that the high-risk individuals in that prior study did not generate the compensatory cortical thickening that we have detected in DD patients because the high risk participants were largely free of illness at the time of scan. Their cortical thinning likely represented instead a trait vulnerability for developing MDD, particularly in relation to thickness in low-risk individuals, whose thicker cortices presumably protected against the development of MDD. Consistent with this interpretation, we also reported that high-risk individuals who endorsed more religious beliefs had thicker cortices relative to high-risk individuals who endorsed less religiosity, and they also had fewer lifetime MDD episodes, suggesting that cortical thickening associated with religiosity was protective against developing MDD(<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>). Our DD patients, in contrast to our prior high-risk sample, had been ill for more than 2 years at the time of study, giving them abundant time to develop neuroplastic cortical hypertrophy, as presumably manifested in those who had thicker cortices and proportionately fewer symptoms. Therefore we suspect that the baseline cortical thickening in DD patients was a consequence of their chronic illness and represented a neuroplastic compensation that helped to attenuate their depressive symptoms. It is possible that the presence of neuroplastic compensation is precisely what distinguished DD from MDD; without compensation, DD patients presumably would become more severe and would then meet criteria for MDD, rather than DD. If this is the case, then an important question for future research is why MDD patients do not engage fully these neuroplastic compensatory processes.</p><p id="P28">We detected a significant treatment-by-time interaction on cortical thickness over the 10-week trial. The interaction derived from treatment-related changes in cortical thickness occurring in both arms, but in opposite directions: in duloxetine-treated patients, the cortex thinned in a direction toward values in healthy participants; in placebo-treated patients, the cortex thickened slightly, and in a direction even more divergent from control values than at baseline. These longitudinal, within-individual analyses further showed that symptom severity declined as the cortex thinned during the trial in the duloxetine-treated patients. Because cortical thickening at baseline and its association with fewer symptoms suggested the presence of neuroplastic compensation, the exaggeration of baseline thickening in the placebo arm during the RCT suggests the presence of continuing neuroplastic compensation with continuing illness. It is tempting to speculate, in fact, that cortical thickening during placebo administration could have contributed to the reduction in symptoms in that arm of the trial. If the same compensatory processes were operating in the duloxetine-treated patients as speculated in the placebo-treated patients, then the duloxetine-induced normalization of cortical thickness would presumably represent the reduced need for compensatory hypertrophy, thanks to the duloxetine-induced reductions in symptom severity. Alternatively, duloxetine-induced normalization of cortical thickness could be a direct consequence of the medication, with the reductions in symptoms following it. We therefore conducted mediation analyses to provide statistical evidence for or against each of these two competing interpretations. We found no statistical evidence that cortical thickness mediated the association of treatment assignment (duloxetine or placebo) with the change in symptom severity during the trial. Instead, we found that the change in symptom severity partially but significantly mediated the association of treatment with change in cortical thickness, supporting the interpretation that medication-induced improvement in symptoms during the trial reduced the need for neuroplastic compensation, thereby reducing cortical thickness toward normal values. Placebo-treated patients, however, continued to require compensation for their continuing symptoms, thereby thickening their cortices during the trial.</p><p id="P29">Our findings provide imaging-based evidence for the presence of an adaptive, neuroplastic compensation in response to chronic symptoms of dysthymia. Neuroplastic changes comprise persistent changes in dendritic length and branching, synaptic density and strength, and neurogenesis, which together produce structural and functional alterations in brain circuits and how they process information in response to changing functional demands on the central nervous system(<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Activity-dependent neuroplasticity has been reported in several prior imaging studies in healthy humans, including experience-dependent changes in gray and white matter volumes in response to learning(<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>), mindfulness meditation(<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), physical exercise(<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), and cognitive training(<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Animal studies have reported cortical thickening in response to environmental enrichment, likely due to neurotrophin-driven increases in dendritic branching(<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), spine density(<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), and glial cell density(<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Studies of older animals in enriched environments(<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>) and older humans who suffered either limb amputations(<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>) or strokes(<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) suggest that neural plasticity is retained across the lifespan. Our findings similarly suggest that neuroplastic compensation is present at all adult ages, although the age-specific effects in the reversion of thickening toward normal values during the trial, being more prominent in younger than in older patients when successfully treated with medication, suggests that neuroplastic hypertrophy may be more dynamic in younger persons.</p><p id="P30">Evidence is growing for the presence of neuroplasticity and its compensatory functions in neuropsychiatric illnesses(<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). The voluntary suppression of tics in patients with Tourette Syndrome, for example, is thought to generate hypertrophy of frontal and parietal cortices, which in turn attenuates the severity of tic symptoms and normalizes excess functional activity during cognitive tasks that require activation of these cortical regions(<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>). Youth who, for reasons unknown, are unable to generate this cortical hypertrophy have more severe symptoms and may be more likely to have illness that persists into adulthood. Additional hypertrophy of the hippocampus is thought to modulate the severity of not only tic symptoms, but also of comorbid Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder symptoms(<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Hypertrophy of the hippocampus is thought to serve a similar symptom-attenuating function in youth who have ADHD without tic disorder(<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). Successful treatment of ADHD youth with stimulant medications has been associated with normalization of highly localized morphological abnormalities in the surfaces of the basal ganglia nuclei(<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>) and thalamus(<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>), presumably because the stimulant-induced increases in dopaminergic transmission supported neuroplastic changes in these subcortical regions. Similarly, studies of veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) showed that the veterans who completely recovered from their illness had larger hippocampal volumes than those with current PTSD(<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>), suggesting either that those with larger hippocampal volumes recovered, or those with neuroplastic reversal of hippocampal volume loss had positive outcomes of treatment and higher rates of symptom remission. Antipsychotic medications have been reported to moderate the age-related decline in gray matter volumes in patients with Schizophrenia(<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Together these studies provide compelling evidence that activity-induced neuroplastic changes in the brain may simultaneously attenuate symptom severity, help maintain cognitive and behavioral performance on tasks that depend on those neural systems, and even contribute to the remission of illness in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><p id="P31">The findings of this study should be interpreted in light of its limitations. First, we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that a thicker cortex at baseline derived from prior use of psychotropic medications in 19 of our patients. However, at the time of recruitment, 15 patients had not used medication more than a year prior to entering the study, and 4 patients on medications underwent a 4-week wash-out period; furthermore, our findings did not change when we excluded those 4 patients from our analyses. We therefore believe that prior use of psychotropic medications did not affect baseline findings of cortical thickening. Second, we acquired MRI data in healthy individuals at only one time point, which limited our ability to assess and interpret fully the brain changes in placebo-treated patients. Nevertheless, the data in healthy participants at even a single time point permitted us to assess whether the medication-induced changes in cortical thickness were in a direction toward or away from values in healthy persons. Third, even though the RCT study design mitigated ascertainment bias by randomly assigning patients to either duloxetine or placebo arm of the study, the participants in the trial may not be representative of all patients in the general population who have depressive illness. Fourth, despite random assignment, patients differed in sex composition across the 2 treatment arms (15 males in placebo, 7 males in duloxetine); symptom severity did not differ between men and women at baseline or at the end of the trial in either of the two treatment arms, however, indicating that treatment effects did not differ by sex. We also incorporated sex as a covariate in all our analyses. Thus we believe that differing sex compositions in the two treatment arms did not confound the effects of treatment on cortical thickness. Finally, our participants, similar to participants in any RCT, may not have been representative of all patients in the general population who have depressive illness.</p><p id="P32">Despite these potential limitations, our findings provide strong evidence for compensatory, activity-dependent, neuroplastic thickening of the cortex that attenuates the chronic symptoms of dysthymia. The baseline cortical thickening may have protected DD patients from developing a more severe form of illness, MDD, which has been associated with thinning across large portions of the cortical surface(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). In this view, the severity and clinical course of depressive illness may depend upon whether an individual is able to engender in the brain an adaptive neuroplastic response to the presence of their distress. Disruptions of neuroplasticity from any cause may interfere with compensatory thickening and lead either to a new onset of illness, more severe symptoms, or clinical relapse. Understanding the molecular and cellular underpinnings of neuroplastic changes in the cortex and why those mechanism fail in certain individuals, and identifying ways to enhance neuroplastic response, will be important in the future to prevent new onset of illness, reduce symptom severity in individuals who are already ill, and induce compensation as a form of resilience in individuals who are at high-risk for developing depressive illnesses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="SM"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><media xlink:href="NIHMS842435-supplement-1.docx" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d36e518" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1"><p id="P33"><bold>Trial Registration</bold>: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00360724</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="FN2"><p id="P34"><bold>CONFLICT OF INTEREST</bold></p><p id="P35">Dr. Bansal reports no financial relationships with commercial interests.</p></fn><fn id="FN3"><p id="P36"><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary information</xref> is available at <italic>Molecular Psychiatry&#x02019;s</italic> website.</p></fn></fn-group><ack id="S21"><p id="P37">This study was supported by NIH grant K02-74677 (PI, Dr. Bradley S.

Thus, the findings in both panels, taken together, suggest that a thicker cortex at baseline is associated with fewer symptoms, likely representing a compensatory, neuroplastic hypertrophy of the cortex.

Furthermore, a significantly (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>=15.14, df=1, p&#x0003c;0.0001) greater proportion of the duloxetine-treated patients had a remission of illness by the end of the trial. The average and standard deviation of age and symptom severity are shown in the table.</p></caption><table frame="box" rules="all"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1"/><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Age<break/>(Years)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Sex</th><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="top" rowspan="1">Symptom Severity<break/>(At Baseline)</th><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="top" rowspan="1">Symptom Severity<break/>(At Week 10)</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Lifetime<break/>MDD</th><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top" colspan="1">Remitted at<break/>Week 10</th></tr><tr><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HDRS</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CDRS</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">HDRS</th><th align="center" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CDRS</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Healthy, N=39</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.55&#x000b1;10.26</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22 Males</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/A</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Duloxetine Arm, N=21</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">39.08&#x000b1;10.00</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7 Males</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.66&#x000b1;4.09</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">37.62&#x000b1;8.16</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.76&#x000b1;3.12*</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.14&#x000b1;7.37*</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold>Placebo Arm, N=20</bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40.82&#x000b1;10.81</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 Males</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.23&#x000b1;4.79</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.38&#x000b1;8.22</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.76&#x000b1;7.71</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">29.04&#x000b1;13.09</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="TFN1"><p id="P54"><bold>HDRS</bold> = Hamilton Depression Rating Scale;

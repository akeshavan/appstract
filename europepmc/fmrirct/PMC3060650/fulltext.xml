The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of protein-energy wasting (PEW) using new diagnostic criteria compared with ICD-10 AM definitions in patients with CKD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-two patients (22 male, 20 female; mean age, 65.7 (SD 17.6)&#x02009;years) from a private haemodialysis unit participated. To determine PEW, four categories are assessed: biochemistry serum albumin (&#x0003c;38&#x000a0;mg/l) or serum cholesterol (&#x0003c;100&#x000a0;mg/100&#x000a0;ml); body mass index (BMI) &#x0003c;23 or total body fat &#x0003c;10%; muscle mass, reduced mid-arm muscle mass area; and reduced dietary intake, protein &#x0003c;0.8&#x000a0;g/kg/day or energy &#x0003c;100&#x000a0;kJ/kg/day. At least three of the four categories must be present to diagnose PEW. The ICD-10 AM definitions of malnutrition include BMI &#x0003c;18.5 or evidence of weight loss, decreased intake and presence of fat loss and muscle wasting. This was assessed using subjective global assessment. Dietary intake was analysed using Foodworks (version 5). Fat mass was determined using bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Ten patients (24%) met the criteria for PEW compared to eight patients (19%) using the ICD-10 AM criteria; however, only three patients met the criteria for both definitions. Thirteen patients had low biochemistry; 14 had low BMI; 19 had low muscle mass; 21 had low intake; two had BMI &#x0003c;18.5; and six had evidence of weight loss, decreased dietary intake, presence of subcutaneous fat loss and muscle wasting. Time taken for the PEW diagnosis was considerably longer than ICD-10 AM.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The new diagnostic criteria for PEW require further validation studies in patients with CKD.</p><p><bold>002</bold></p><p><bold>Practice-guiding classification of cancer cachexia in palliative cancer care (PCC): clinical pilot evaluation of the SIPP assessment tool</bold></p><p><bold>David Blum</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Kenneth C.

Current nutritional assessment tools identify patients at risk for malnutrition, but guide less practice. A common clinical classification, with simple, robust assessments specific for cancer and the PCC context, is required to improve care decisions, outcomes, and clinical trial design. The aim of this study is to develop a cancer-specific, practice-guiding cachexia classification and assessment system, based on the generic cachexia definition.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>: Three systematic literature reviews, two focus group rounds, and a formal Delphi process among clinical academic cancer cachexia experts were conducted to reach an agreement, based on current evidence and consensus on definition, diagnosis, classification, and practical assessment of cancer cachexia. A resulting classification/assessment (SIPP system) is pilot tested in PCC clinics.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Consensus on assessments is reached for domains, but not (yet) for selection of measures. The SIPP contains storage (gap of usual to current weight, WL duration, control for fluid retention or obesity, and specific nutrients&#x02019; deficit), intake (anorexia, early satiety, percentage of normal intake, 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;days dietary record, and secondary nutrition impact symptoms), potential (tumor (catabolic) activity and C-reactive protein), and performance (performance status, cachexia-related suffering, and prognosis). Three phases (pre-cachexia (risk for cachexia), cachexia syndrome, and late unlikely-to-be-reversible cachexia) are proposed. Feasibility, content validity, and independent clinicians agreement on multidimensional interventions are promising (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;10; age, 46&#x02013;72&#x000a0;years).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> The SIPP system seems promising to guide practice in PCC, final agreement on assessments is required, and prospective testing to refine cancer cachexia phases and phenotypes is needed.</p><p><bold>003</bold></p><p><bold>Cachexia-related suffering: development of an assessment system guiding clinical interventions</bold></p><p><bold>Hanspeter Haene</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Rolf Oberholzer</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jane B.

The aim of the study is to develop an assessment instrument for CRS.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>: Based on patients&#x02019; and proxies&#x02019; focus groups (Strasser, Palliat Med 21:129&#x02013;137, 2007) and a systematic literature review, a CRS item pool was developed. A multidisciplinary team (nurses, nutritionists, and palliative care physicians; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) reviewed and rated items (agreed, not agreed, and discuss) in two rounds, resulting in 121 items. We test their face validity, completeness, and practicability (negative emotions) in a cross-sectional design, providing each patient two-item sets (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25). Demographics include living situation, age, nationality, education, religion, BMI, cachexia staging, cognition, Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale, Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale, subjective (0&#x02009;=&#x02009;none, 10&#x02009;=&#x02009;maximal) importance of eating, eating with a partner, amount of eating, and eating-related suffering (ERS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Thirteen patients (age, 48&#x02013;74&#x000a0;years; five female; weight loss, 3&#x02013;12.5%; HADS-A, 6; HADS-D, 9.5; ERS patient, 7.7; ERS family, 7.5) judged at 15 interviews 36 items (eight items, &#x02265;2 patients) as insufficient comprehensible before explanation. These items contained subordinate clauses or complicated words and were reworded. Twenty-two items (four items, &#x02265;2 patients) released desire to talk or mild emotions. Findings lacked an association to demographic data. No items about ERS/CRS are missing.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This is the first study investigating systematically items for a subjective assessment of cachexia-related suffering.

It has been suspected that the observed excessive fatigue do not depend only on muscle atrophy and weakness but also depend on other factors. The aim of the current study was to investigate whether factors related to quality of life and general health contribute to the level of general fatigue in patients receiving hemodialysis therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fifty-two hemodialysis patients (15 female/37 male; age, 55&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;17; BMI, 25.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.4; years in dialysis, 2.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2) consented to participate in this study. Hemodialysis patients were assessed for their functional capacity; body composition (DEXA); levels of central adiposity, muscle quality, and liver fat by CT; insulin resistance (OGTT); perceived quality of life parameters; and fatigue by various questionnaires.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The overall quality of life score was below 70% (67&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18), implying a low level of perceived life quality. Fatigue significantly correlated with gait speed (&#x02212;0.397, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), exercise performance (&#x02212;0.338, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), abdominal girth (&#x02212;0.357, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02), visceral adiposity (&#x02212;0.421, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), liver fat levels (0.528, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), indices of insulin sensitivity (0.432, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), sleep diary (&#x02212;0.435, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), daily sleepiness (&#x02212;0.354, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01), and depression (&#x02212;0.526, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01).

Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing adipocytokine. In CHF, high adiponectin confers poor prognosis. We investigated the expression of adiponectin, the adiponectin receptor, and genes involved in downstream lipid and glucose metabolism in the skeletal muscle of CHF patients before and after exercise training (ET).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Nine CHF patients and ten healthy subjects underwent clinical assessment, echocardiography, and CPET. Muscle biopsies (m. vastus lateralis) were taken to assess mRNA expression of adiponectin, AdipoR1, and downstream metabolic genes. The effect of combined endurance-resistance ET (ambulatory training, three sessions/week, and 60&#x000a0;min duration) in CHF was assessed after 4&#x000a0;months.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Adiponectin expression in CHF patients was higher compared to healthy subjects (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), whereas AdipoR1 was downregulated (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). In addition, the expression of genes involved in lipid (PPAR-alpha, ACADM) and glucose metabolism (AMPK-alpha1, HK2) was reduced in CHF.</p><p>ET increased maximal workload and muscle strength and lowered mRNA expression of adiponectin (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02), whereas AdipoR1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.01) expressed was increased to levels comparable to healthy subjects. Furthermore, both AMPK-alpha1 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02) and PPAR-alpha mRNA expression (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05) were upregulated.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> CHF patients are characterized by increased adiponectin expression and decreased expression of AdipoR1 and downstream metabolic genes. ET normalizes the expression of adiponectin and AdipoR1 and reverses the disorders in lipid and glucose metabolism. These alterations in metabolic gene expression following exercise might help to understand the beneficial effects of ET in CHF.</p><p><bold>006</bold></p><p><bold>Increased proteasome activity in skeletal muscle of patients with chronic heart failure&#x02014;a fluent transition to cachectic disease state?</bold></p><p><bold>Tibor Szab&#x000f3;</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Anja Sandek</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Anika Hartmann</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Jochen Springer</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Stephan von Haehling</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Volker Adams</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Stefan D.

The associated muscle wasting accelerates the downward spiral of symptomatic status and particularly poor prognosis. We investigated proteasome activity in skeletal muscle as an indicator of protein catabolism in cachectic and non-cachectic CHF patients and healthy controls.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied 26 stable CHF patients (age, 65&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.2&#x000a0;years (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SEM); BMI, 26.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4; NYHA I/II/III, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2/21/11) and 30 healthy controls of similar age and BMI. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis of the quadriceps using the Bergstrom needle technique. The obtained samples were homogenized in lysis buffer. Of protein, 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was used for the fluorogenic assay (substrate:benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin-Z-LLE-AMC, Biomol), in which substrate turnover was determined. The activity was calculated by using free amidomethylcoumarin (AMC) as working standard.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Proteasome activity was significantly increased in CHF patients compared to controls (0.35&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.16 vs 0.04&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01&#x000a0;units/mg; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.038). Among CHF patients, seven subjects have been diagnosed as cachectic following the current consensus-based definition. The highest proteasome activity was observed in the cachectic subgroup (0.61&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.46&#x000a0;units/mg) as compared to non-cachectic CHF (0.24&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.13&#x000a0;units/mg) and to controls (Con: 0.04&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.01&#x000a0;units/mg; ANOVA, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our study shows that proteasome activity is elevated in patients with CHF as compared to healthy subjects of similar age. This finding is in accord with the observed overall increased catabolic drive in CHF. Proteasome activity is highest in the cachectic subgroup. Increased proteasome activity may therefore be an underlying mechanism of muscle wasting in CHF.</p><p><bold>007</bold></p><p><bold>Skeletal muscle measured at the time of ICU admission may be determinant of clinical outcomes</bold></p><p><bold>Marina Mourtzakis</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Charlene Fan</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Daren K.

Siren</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Bioneris Ab, Stockholm, Sweden; <sup>2</sup>JGK Memorial Research Library and Laboratory, Helsinki, Finland</p><p><bold>Background and aims</bold>: Several diverse factors such as Ang-II, PIF, LPS, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and conditions such as chronic inflammation, sepsis, and cancer induce cachexia. We have hypothesized that systemic redistribution of Zn and its accumulation in muscle tissue plays a key role in muscle wasting. To help assess the validity of this hypothesis, we suggest a link between cachexia inducing conditions/factors and zinc redistribution.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The hypothesis is based on data on the fluctuation and regulation of Zn homeostasis in animal and man and the extensive literature on acute phase response (APR).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> APR is the host&#x02019;s normal acute response to trauma, inflammation, and infection. APR is characterized by protein catabolism and appears to play a central role in cachexia, but APR&#x02019;s mechanism of action in cachexia is unresolved<sup>1</sup>. APR&#x02019;s salient characteristics include the steep decline of serum zinc levels and the redistribution of internal zinc stores<sup>2,3</sup>. Several factors mediate APR, and at least TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6, and LPS significantly reduce serum zinc levels and drive the redistribution of internal zinc stores.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Chronic APR is a well-known host defense mechanism commonly observed in cachexic patients. APR is characterized by significant Zn redistribution and hypozincemia. We have hypothesized earlier that in cachexia, systemic Zn redistribution and hypozincemia cause anorexia, growth failure in children, inflammation, insulin resistance, and hypogonadism. We suggest that chronic APR may explain the mechanism behind these symptoms. APR also suggests a mechanism for how Zn is mobilized for PKR-mediated muscle wasting (see Figure).</p><p><sup>1</sup>Curr Opin Support Palliat Care 2:267&#x02013;274, 2008</p><p><sup>2</sup>PNAS 102(19):6843&#x02013;6848, 2005</p><p><sup>3</sup>Am J Physiol 272 (Endocrinol Metab 35):E952, 1997

Davis, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p>C-reactive protein (CRP) is gaining credibility as a prognostic factor in different cancers. A conventional Cox&#x02019;s model is usually used to assess prognostic factors. However, this model imposes a priori assumptions that (1) the hazard ratio associated with each prognostic factor remains constant across the entire follow-up interval (PH assumption), and (2) the relationship between the continuous predictor and the logarithm of the mortality hazard is linear (linearity assumption), which are rarely tested. We tested these assumptions for CRP, using a flexible statistical model, while adjusting for other known prognostic factors, in a cohort of 269 patients newly diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the conventional Cox&#x02019;s model, high CRP increased the risk of death (HR&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.11 per each doubling of CRP value; 95% CI, 1.03&#x02013;1.20, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008). However, both the PH assumption (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033) and the linearity assumption (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.015) were rejected for CRP measured at the initiation of chemotherapy, which kept its prognostic value for only about 18&#x000a0;months. Our analysis demonstrates that flexible modeling provides new insights about the value of CRP as a prognostic factor in NSCLC, and that a conventional Cox&#x02019;s model underestimates early risks associated with high CRP.</p><p><bold>012</bold></p><p><bold>Studies on intestinal blood flow in patients with chronic heart failure compared to healthy control subjects</bold></p><p><bold>Anja Sandek</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Juergen Bauditz</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Ralph Herrmann</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Nancy Steinm&#x000fc;ller</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Stephan von Haehling</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Mathias Rauchhaus</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Stefan D.

Impaired tissue perfusion may likely occur as well in the intestinal vascular bed. This hypoperfusion may contribute to impaired intestinal barrier function, increased bacterial translocation, chronic inflammation, malnutrition, and cachexia as observed in CHF. Intestinal arterial blood flow in comparison to limb blood flow has not yet been studied in CHF.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>: We prospectively investigated 16 patients with CHF (age, 64.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.3&#x000a0;years; LVEF, 29.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.5%; peak VO<sub>2</sub>, 15.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2&#x000a0;mL/kg/min; NYHA class, 2.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.1; BMI, 27.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 17 control subjects of similar age and gender (peak VO<sub>2</sub>, 27.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6&#x000a0;mL/kg/min; LVEF, 66.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.1%; BMI, 26.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Forearm blood flow at rest and post-ischemic peak blood flow were assessed by venous occlusion plethysmography. Intestinal peak systolic blood flow was calculated from peak systolic velocity and vessel diameter of the mesenteric arteries, as well as of the coeliac trunk using high-resolution ultrasound and Doppler sonography. We assessed small intestinal permeability by lactulose&#x02013;mannitol test, bowel wall thickness by transcutaneous sonography, and mucosal bacterial biofilm by FISH in biopsies taken during sigmoidoscopy.</p><p><bold>Results</bold>: In CHF, we found a lower intestinal peak systolic blood flow in the inferior mesenteric artery in CHF patients compared to controls (6.03&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.72 vs. 8.40&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.74&#x000a0;mL/s, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.04).

Intestinal systolic blood flow of the superior mesenteric artery was similar in CHF and control subjects (42.46&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.28 vs. 47.47&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.06&#x000a0;mL/s, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4). CHF patients had lower forearm resting blood flow (2.83&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.41 vs. 4.74&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.86&#x000a0;mL/100&#x000a0;mL/min, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) compared to controls and lower peak post-ischemic blood flow (13.84&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.53 vs. 19.57&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.01&#x000a0;mL/100&#x000a0;mL/min, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.03), indicating impaired vasodilator capacity. Furthermore, CHF patients showed a lower blood mid-regional proadrenomedullin concentration as a biomarker of impaired endothelial function (0.82&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.09 vs 0.51&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.02&#x000a0;nmol/L, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.003).

Altered mitochondrial function and beta-3 adrenergic receptor pathway activation have been proposed as potential mechanisms of ZAG effects. Our study aimed at evaluating the role of ZAG in cardiac cachexia (CXC) and at determining its relationships with adipose metabolism in a cohort of chronic heart failure patients. Sixty-four advanced heart failure (AHF, NYHA functional class III&#x02013;IV) patients have been recruited in a tertiary university hospital over a period of 4&#x000a0;years, 18 of whom showed CXC with an unwilling and oedema-free reduction in body weight of more than 7.5% in the last 6&#x000a0;months. Abnormal thyroid function, previous or current cancer disease, severe chronic obstructive pulmonary and severe renal or hepatic failure have been excluded. No significant differences in age, gender proportion, ejection fraction and blood pressure between the two groups have been observed. Higher plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentrations were measured in CXC patients as compared to AHF; ZAG serum concentration (ELISA, Biovendor, Germany) was similar in CXC and AHF, both groups showing higher plasma levels versus an age-matched healthy group of subjects. ZAG and FFA levels showed a positive correlation in CXC patients (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>, 0.29; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02), whereas such a relationship was missing in AHF group. Since there are no differences in ZAG values between CXC and non-CXC AHF groups, these preliminary data seem to suggest an increased sensitivity to ZAG in stimulating lipolysis in CXC.</p><p><bold>017</bold></p><p><bold>Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein in adipose atrophy in human cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Tomas Mracek</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Nathan A.

Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a recently identified adipokine, has been suggested as a candidate in the regulation of adiposity. We investigated the potential role of ZAG in adipose atrophy in human cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five gastrointestinal (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) and pancreatic (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) cancer patients with cachexia (mean weight loss being 14.7%) or without were recruited. ZAG mRNA levels (real-time PCR) and protein expression (Western blotting) were assessed in subcutaneous AT. Tissue morphology was examined using light microscopy. Serum ZAG levels were quantified by ELISA. The effect of recombinant ZAG on lipolysis was evaluated in human primary adipocytes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> AT remodelling in cancer cachexia patients (weight loss &#x02265;5%) was characterised by shrunken adipocytes with increased fibrosis evident by strong collagen-fibril staining in the tissue matrix. ZAG mRNA levels in AT were increased in cancer cachexia (2.7-fold, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.028). Concurrently, ZAG protein expression was enhanced in cachectic cancer patients. ZAG mRNA showed a negative correlation with BMI (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.43, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.016), but a positive correlation with weight loss (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.033).

Serum ZAG levels did not differ between weight-losing and weight-stable patients. In vitro, ZAG production by differentiated adipocytes was abundant. Treatment with recombinant ZAG stimulated glycerol release by human adipocytes.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results suggest that adipokine ZAG is involved in adipose atrophy in human cancer cachexia. This could be, at least partly, attributable to its lipid-mobilising effect in human adipocytes.</p><p><bold>018</bold></p><p><bold>Plasma retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) but not its adipose expression is associated with systemic inflammation and monocyte TNF-alpha expression in non-diabetic dialysis patients</bold></p><p><bold>Rocco Barazzoni</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Manuela Zanetti</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Annamaria Semolic</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Alessia Pirulli</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Maria Rosa Cattin</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Lucia Gottardo</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Giani Biolo</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Pierandrea Vinci</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Alessandra Bosutti</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Giovanni Panzetta</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Annamaria Bernardi</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Gianfranco Guarnieri</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Clinica Medica, Department of Medical, Technological and Translational Sciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy; <sup>2</sup>Division of Nephrology, Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria Ospedali Riuniti, Trieste, Italy; <sup>3</sup>Division of Nephrology, Rovigo Hospital, Rovigo, Italy</p><p><bold>Background and aims</bold>: Adipose-secreted retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) circulates in free and transthyretin (TTR)-bound forms and may be associated with obesity-related inflammation.

These variables were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analyses, and those variables that were independently prognostic at the multivariate level were assigned PSI scores proportional to prognostic weight.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A training set of patients in a palliative home care service (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1164) was used to identify prognostic variables. A U-shaped relationship was seen between survival and percent weight change, with increased risk of death with increasing weight loss, or with short-term weight gain, compared with stable weight. Obesity was protective, and risk of death increased for BMI.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> More accurate prognostication is feasible and can be achieved by combining clinical and demographic features with relevant nutritional features related to food intake and body weight.</p><p><bold>025</bold></p><p><bold>Cachexia in patients with chronic pancreatitis is different from cachexia in pancreatic cancer</bold></p><p><bold>Jeannine Bachmann</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Knut Ketterer</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Wolfgang B&#x000f6;micke</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Marc Bauer</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Markus W.

Cachexia, defined as loss of more than 10% of stable weight, in pancreatic cancer has a significant influence on resection rate and survival. The aim of the study was to compare the prevalence of cachexia in chronic pancreatitis and cancer patients with a special interest to show differences.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In 605 patients who underwent operation in the Department of Surgery, University of Heidelberg&#x02014;437 with pancreatic cancer and 168 with chronic pancreatitis&#x02014;an evaluation of the preoperative clinical course and perioperative data was available.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Cachexia was present in 42% of CP and 37% of cancer patients. Although the amount of weight loss did not differ significantly, there was a more pronounced systemic effect of cachexia in PDAC patients, with significantly reduced protein, albumin, and hemoglobin levels and elevated CRP levels. Cachexia developed over a significantly longer period in CP patients. Cachexia in cancer was significantly associated with metastases leading to a significantly reduced resection rate. With or without tumor resection, cachexia had an ongoing effect on survival.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although there are significant effects on nutritional status, neither morbidity nor 30-day mortality is increased in patients with cachexia. There is a similar prevalence of cachexia in patients with CP and PDAC and no difference in the amount of weight loss between the groups, but many more significant systemic effects are detected in cancer patients with cachexia.</p><p><bold>026</bold></p><p><bold>Does the new operational definition of cachexia (ODC) help with profiling nutrition and performance characteristics in advanced cancer patients?</bold></p><p><bold>Antonio A.

The prominent clinical feature of cachexia is weight loss in adults (corrected for fluid retention) or growth failure in children (excluding endocrine disorders). Anorexia, inflammation, insulin resistance, and increased muscle protein breakdown are frequently associated with cachexia. Cachexia is distinct from starvation, age-related loss of muscle mass, primary depression, malabsorption, and hyperthyroidism and is associated with increased morbidity&#x0201d; [1]. Although this definition is accompanied by diagnostic criteria, it does not consider the problem of staging. Indeed, stratification of patients is important when considering therapy. In fact, in the very first stages of wasting, body weight loss is not necessarily involved&#x02014;a state known as pre-cachexia. The aim of the present score is to overcome the problem of patient staging. The score considers five main different factors: body weight and lean body mass loss, anorexia, inflammatory, immunological and metabolic disturbances, physical performance, and quality of life. The score&#x02019;s scale goes from 0 to 100: mild cachexia (less than 25), moderate (more than 25 and less than 50), severe (more than 50 and less than 75), and terminal phase (more than 75 and up to 100). The score also takes into consideration pre-cachexia. In conclusion, the present score will facilitate cachexia staging and therefore will allow for a more convenient therapy.</p><p>[1] Evans WJ, Morley JE, Argil&#x000e9;s J, Bales C, Baracos V, Guttridge D, Jatoi A, Kalantar-Zadeh K, Lochs H, Mantovani G, Marks D, Mitch WE, Muscaritoli M, Najand A, Ponikowski P, Rossi Fanelli F, Schambelan M, Schols A, Schuster M, Thomas D, Wolfe R, Anker SD (2008) Cachexia: a new definition.

Once present, it is associated with grim prognosis. The therapeutic approach to cachexia to date must be considered as undefined, with few exceptions. Public health primarily seeks for population-based strategies to tackle diseases with major impact on health care system.</p><p><bold>Epidemiology and management challenges:</bold> Several definitions with different criteria and cut-offs were used, and only recently, a consensus for clinically relevant cachexia was reached. Epidemiological data is therefore speculative, based on chronic disease prevalence and assumption that 10&#x02013;80% of patients, depending on the condition and standards of care, eventually develop cachexia. Geographical variations in prevalence of chronic disease are substantial and conform with socioeconomic status and available medical care. Our management approach should therefore consider all circumstances including those beyond the chronic disease and adopt the interventions with greatest impact potential for selected community. Fighting infectious disease and poverty is important and would transiently decrease cachexia patient pool. However, since chronic disease continuum is more and more present in developing countries, this will eventually be counter- or ever overbalanced, and cachexia will presumably remain an important public health issue. It is therefore even more important to intensify our therapeutic efforts to stop or even to reverse the deadly cascade of events leading to cachexia and improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes for our patients.</p><p><bold>Clinical implications:</bold> Cachexia meets several criteria that need to be addressed by public health practitioners. Preventive and educational strategies, particularly in communities with high prevalence of HIV infection, malnutrition, and rheumatic fever-related cachexia, may be beneficial. Public health strategies in developed countries where cachexia is mainly related to cancer, chronic cardiopulmonary, and kidney disease need to target other issues than in non-developed countries.</p><p><bold>029</bold></p><p><bold>Anti-tumor and antioxidant effects of antioxidant nutrients in breast cancer-implanted rats</bold></p><p><bold>Yu Koyama</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Banyu Takahashi</bold><sup>2</sup><bold>, Miki Hasegawa</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Eiko Sakata</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Mayuko Ikarashi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Naoko Manba</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Katsuyoshi Hatakeyama</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Division of Digestive and General Surgery, Niigata University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Niigata, Japan; <sup>2</sup>EN Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Hanamaki, Japan</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> In the present study, we examined the anti-tumor and anti-oxidative stress effects of antioxidant nutrients in breast cancer-implanted rats, in order to investigate the validity of antioxidants-containing enteral formula.</p><p><bold>Materials:</bold> Female F344 rats were divided into two groups: control diet and antioxidant (AO) diet. After 7&#x000a0;days of feeding each nutrient diet, breast cancer Mat B-III cells were transplanted subcutaneously, and each diet was continued until sacrifice in each group. The body weights, intake volume of each diet, and tumor size were measured daily, and the rats were sacrificed on post-transplantation days&#x000a0;7 and 14. Blood samples were collected to measure serum total protein, albumin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 2,2&#x02032;-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulphonate) (ABTS) radical-scavenging activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) activity.

It remains elusive whether cancer cachexia causes heart failure. In this study, we investigated the effect of cancer cachexia on heart function and cardiac muscle structure in a mouse model for cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Male CD2F1 mice were inoculated with either 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;106 colon-26 adenocarcinoma cells (tumor group) or vehicle (PBS; no tumor group).

This study aims to investigate pro- and antioxidant pathways as possible contributors to cardiac atrophy in cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eight-week-old nude mice received either an intraperitoneal injection of MAC16 (murine adenocarcinoma cells; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16) producing cancer-induced cachexia, MAC13 (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) cells used as no cachexia control or an equal amount of cell media (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) as no tumour control. The levels of DNA damage by oxidation were examined, mRNA levels for xanthine dehydrogena se, NADPH oxidase subunits p47, p67, NOX2, NOX4 and total superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme activity were analysed. A Western blot protein analysis was carried out examining both NOX2 and P47 expression.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Food and water intake did not vary between groups. Heart weight was significantly decreased in the MAC16 group by 15%. A marker for DNA oxidative damage 8-OH-2dG was significantly increased in the MAC16 group. Gene transcripts for xanthine dehydrogenase were significantly increased in cachectic heart muscle. Significant decreases were found with total SOD enzyme activity.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The significant increase in 8-OH-2dG and gene expression of an ROS producer in the myocardium, xanthine dehydrogenase may imply an important role for this system in the atrophy of the cachectic heart. Furthermore, decreases in total SOD activity may indicate an inability for handling ROS. Overall, oxidative stress may switch on proteolytic systems in the cachectic heart leading to significant atrophy.</p><p><bold>032</bold></p><p><bold>Efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in liver mitochondria is decreased in cancer cachexia: a role for cardiolipin and reactive oxygen species (ROS)?</bold></p><p><bold>Jean-Francois Dumas</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Cloe M.

Whether mitochondria function is altered during this disease and may participate to hypermetabolism is not clear. The aim of our study was to analyze liver mitochondrial function, especially the efficiency of ATP synthesis and its regulating mechanisms (proton leak, oxidative stress, and cardiolipin) in a rat model of cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Oxygen consumption (oxygraph), ATP synthesis (spectrophotometer), membrane potential (TPMP+ electrode), ROS production (fluorimeter), and cardiolipin content (fluorimeter) were measured in isolated liver mitochondria from cachectic (peritoneal carcinosis (PC)) and pair-fed control rats.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Our results showed that efficiency of ATP synthesis was lower (&#x02212;24%) in liver mitochondria from PC than control rats. Proton leak was higher in PC than control rats as state 4 oxygen consumption was increased (+22%) and state 4 membrane potential was decreased (&#x02212;5%). ROS production was increased (12-fold), and cardiolipin content was higher (+55%) in liver mitochondria from PC than control rats.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our results demonstrate that PC induces important energy wasting in liver mitochondria. In consequence, more nutrients are necessary to synthetize a given quantity of ATP. Because liver is accounting for 25% of total body energy expenditure, this could participate to hypermetabolism and the weight loss associated to cancer cachexia. Our results suggest that cardiolipin and ROS could partly explain the decrease in ATP synthesis efficiency in liver.</p><p><bold>033</bold></p><p><bold>Does energy wasting in skeletal muscle mitochondria play a role in hypermetabolism observed in cancer cachexia?

Mechanisms of hypermetabolism remain to be fully elucidated. We hypothesize that energy wasting in mitochondria of skeletal muscle (30% of resting metabolism rate) could contribute to hypermetabolism. Peritoneal carcinosis (PC), a frequent complication of digestive cancer, was generated by an intraperitoneal injection of PROb cells in BDIX rats. A group of rats was pair-fed for PC rats in order to discriminate between the effect of anorexia or cachexia. PC rats were sacrificed at a severe cachexia state (food intake reduced to &#x02212;80%). Mitochondrial oxygen consumption and ATP synthesis were measured (by oxygraphy and spectrophotometry, respectively), and the efficiency of ATP production (ATP/O ratio) was assessed on mitochondria isolated from skeletal muscle. PC rats displayed a lower body weight gain as well as lower muscle (&#x02212;17%) and fat (&#x02212;40%) masses than pair-fed rats, suggesting a hypermetabolism state. Besides, serum TNF-alpha was significantly increased in PC rats (27-fold). Muscle mitochondria did not exhibit modification in the ATP/O ratio. However, data also showed a decrease in oxygen consumption linked to ATP synthesis in PC rats mitochondria (480&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;69 vs 600&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;65&#x000a0;natoms&#x02009;O&#x02009;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;mg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in PC and pair-fed rats, respectively). Contrary to our hypothesis, there was no energy wasting in skeletal muscle mitochondria in PC rats. However, as cancer cachexia is a progressive syndrome, we cannot rule out that ATP/O ratio alterations are present in earlier cachectic state.</p><p><bold>034</bold></p><p><bold>Role of dermcidin in cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Jos&#x000e9; Beliz&#x000e1;rio</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Dayson Fria&#x000e7;a Moreira</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Miguel Garay-Malpartida</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Janete Kashiabara</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Janaina P&#x000e1;dua-Borges</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Cibely Oliveira-Fontes</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Edouard Vannier</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Pharmacology of Institute of Biomedical Sciences - USP, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, SP, Brazil; <sup>2</sup>Division of Geographic Medicine and ID, Tufts University-New England Medical Center, Boston, MA, USA</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Many host and tumor-secreted products act as mediators of cancer cachexia. The dermcidin (DCD) gene is overexpressed in various types of cancer, and its products may have biological functions in cancer etiology and host pathophysiology. This study evaluates the role of DCD in causing cancer cachexia in murine xenograft models.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Groups of C57BL/6 or Balb/c nude mice (16&#x02013;25&#x000a0;g) were subcutaneously injected with murine melanoma B-16, human melanoma G-361 cell lines, human breast carcinoma MCF-7, and MDA-MB-361 cell lines with stably overexpression of the gene or their derived clones constitutively expressing shRNA against DCD mRNA (knockdown) as well as the daily i.p. injection of rhDCD. The body weight changes, tumor volume, and performance status were monitored daily from 10 to 120&#x000a0;days.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The body weights remained steady or did not gained weight in the B16-DCD-, MCF-7-DCD-, and MDA-361-implanted mice despite of larger tumors as compared to controls. On the contrary, mice bearing G-361 melanoma cells underwent a progressive loss of body weight, which could be partially suppressed by expressing constitutively shRNA against DCD or twice-weekly injection of rabbit polyclonal antibody against DCD. The twice-a-week exogenous administration of rhDCD for 10&#x000a0;days did not cause any symptom associated with cachexia.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> It is proposed that cancer cachexia is not directly associated with the expression or activities of DCD 11&#x000a0;kDa protein but by others host and tumor cells products in which the expression is regulated by DCD.</p><p>Support by FAPESP.</p><p><bold>035</bold></p><p><bold>Involvement of autophagy in the pathogenesis of cancer-induced muscle wasting</bold></p><p><bold>Domiziana Costamagna, Fabio Penna, Fabrizio Pin, Gabriella Bonelli, Francesco M. Baccino, Paola Costelli</bold></p><p>Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Muscle atrophy associated with chronic diseases mainly results from protein hypercatabolism. In particular, the degradation of myofibrillar proteins occurring in cancer cachexia eventually depends on the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Recently, the possible contribution of the autophagic/lysosomal pathway has been proposed. The present study has been aimed to evaluate whether autophagy is involved in cancer-induced skeletal muscle atrophy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Balb-c mice were divided into controls (C) and tumor bearers (TB). The latter were inoculated s.c. with 5&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;105 C-26 tumor cells. After 13&#x000a0;days, mice were sacrificed, and the gastrocnemius (GSN) muscle was excised and stored for further analysis. C2C12 myocytes were exposed to TNF-alpha during 48&#x000a0;h. Levels of LC3B-II and p62, two accepted markers of autophagy, were analyzed by Western blotting (WB) and immunofluorescence (IF).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GSN weight loss in TB was associated with increased levels of both LC3B-II and p62. To investigate if proinflammatory cytokines may contribute to such increase, LC3B-II and p62 levels were evaluated also in TNF-alpha-treated C2C12 myotubes.

Recent studies showed that physical activity after cancer diagnosis lowers the risk of both cancer-specific and overall mortality, although no specific assessment of cachexia was performed in these studies. With the aim to assess whether exercise may be beneficial against cancer cachexia, we analyzed the effects of spontaneous physical activity (wheel running) in colon carcinoma (C26)-bearing mice. Two exercise protocols were used: 5-day running or 19-day running (starting after tumor implant). We found that while cachectic muscle showed fiber damage and necrosis, wheel running did not exacerbate muscle damage. The beneficial effects of exercise in tumor-bearing mice were induced only by the 19-day running protocol and included the rescue of body weight loss, muscle mass loss, fiber atrophy, and enhanced protein catabolism. Besides, exercise was an appetite stimulant. We noted that cachexia resulted in loss of muscle resistance to fatigue and not of specific force, and we found that exercise rescued muscle resistance of tumor-bearing mice to healthy control levels. The effects of exercise resulted in an average 50% life span extension in tumor-bearing mice. In conclusion, according to all the diagnostic criteria derived from the current consensus definition of cachexia, wheel running started at the onset on pathology efficiently counteracts cancer cachexia in mice and extends their life span.</p><p><bold>038</bold></p><p><bold>Anti-inflammatory effect of exercise training in cachexia: role of interleukin (IL) 10</bold></p><p><bold>Miguel Batista Jr., Fabio S. Lira, Marilia Seelaender</bold></p><p>Cancer Metabolism Research Group, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil</p><p>Cachexia is a multifaceted syndrome whose aetiology is extremely complex and is directly related to the reduction of survival and to poor prognosis. Changes in lipid metabolism in cancer cachexia include marked reduction of total fat mass, increased lipolysis, total oxidation of fatty acids, hyperlipidaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hypercholesterolaemia. These changes are believed to be induced by inflammatory mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). As an endocrine and inflammatory organ, white adipose tissue (WAT) is an important source of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may trigger several changes in WAT and systemic homeostasis. In addition to pharmacological approaches, lifestyle modifications have been advocated for the treatment of chronic inflammation. In order to counteract inflammation in chronic disease, our group has currently adopted chronic endurance exercise in experimental models of cancer cachexia (Walker 256 carcinosarcoma) and chronic heart failure. Since it is clear that white adipose tissue is strongly implicated in the secretion of both pro- and anti-inflammatory factors in disease, we chose to address its contribution to cachexia-related inflammation and the effect of endurance training on the capacity of cytokine expression and secretion by this tissue. Our results show a reduction of tumour mass and infiltrating macrophage cell number in WAT. An enhancement of IL-10 adipose tissue and skeletal muscle content, with concomitant increased IL-10/TNF-alpha ratio, was also demonstrated after endurance training. Taken together, our results suggest that the increase in IL-10 concentration might be induced by PPAR-&#x00192;&#x000d7; activation induced by exercise training leading to a shift towards decreased inflammation.</p><p>Support by FAPESP.</p><p><bold>039</bold></p><p><bold>Exercise increases liver fatty acid oxidation and prevents steatosis in tumour-bearing rats</bold></p><p><bold>Fabio S.

Moderate intensity exercise training is known to counteract chronic inflammation and affects the expression of inflammatory factors in WAT. We compared three different adipose pads (retroperitoneal (RPAT), mesenteric (MAT) and epidiymal (EAT)) in regard to the effects of training (TBEx, 6&#x000a0;weeks treadmill, 60&#x02013;65% VO<sub>2</sub> max) upon inflammation in cachectic Yoshida AH-130 tumour-bearing rats (TB), with special focus on the NF-kappaB pathway. The results show that training prevented the infiltration of mononuclear cells and fibrosis in WAT (qualitative light microscopy) but was not able to counteract the increase in NF-kappaB to DNA (ELISA) in MAT due to cachexia, although a tendency (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.055) to decreased NF-kappaB mRNA expression (real-time PCR) was observed. In EAT, solely, training induced an augment in phosphor-NF-kappaB expression (Western blot), together with enhanced depot weight, as compared with TB. For TARP, no significant differences were found between groups. The marked decrease of weight expected due to cachexia was prevented (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001) in the three muscles examined (soleus, gastrocnemius and tibilalis) by training. We conclude that the short period training protocol was able to affect the NF-kappaB pathway in WAT in a heterogeneous manner, as well as preventing inflammatory cell infiltration. The preservation of muscle mass herein reported strongly suggests the potential of exercise as an adjuvant therapy in the control of wasting in cachexia.</p><p>Funding by FAPESP 08/54091-9.</p><p><bold>041</bold></p><p><bold>Heterogeneous response of rat and human adipose tissue in cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Marilia Seelaender, Miguel Batista Jr.</bold></p><p>Cancer Metabolism Research Group, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil</p><p>White adipose tissue (WAT), whose morphology and physiology vary according to depot anatomical localisation, is markedly affected by cachexia. We demonstrated that in the Walker 256 model of cachexia, the retroperitoneal (RPAT), mesenteric (MAT), and epididymal (EAT) pads respond differently: while EAT shows the greatest decrease in weight, the other depots present pronounced changes regarding adipocyte shape and size. Fatty acid composition is modified in MAT and EAT, but not in RPAT. Ultrastructural abnormalities were observed in RPAT and EAT, solely. In a subsequent investigation, we found that the pads were markedly infiltrated with macrophages resembling &#x0201c;fo am cells&#x0201d; in cachectic rats. The extent of infiltration was greater in MAT, which showed higher TNF-alpha production, although the depots responded similarly in regard to decreased leptin secretion. The IL10/TNF-alpha ratio, a marker of inflammation, was also found to vary heterogeneously. These results encouraged us to examine whether human WAT would also show heterogeneous response to cachexia. The omental (OAT) and subcutaneous (SC) pads of 18 cachectic cancer (gastric and colon, CCAC) patients from the university hospital were studied and compared with the tissue of non-cachectic cancer patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8, CC) and with eight &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; subjects (non-cachectic, hernia, or cirrhosis patients, CT).

In response to the cachexia-related pro-inflammatory cytokines, there is concomitant enhanced production of anti-inflammatory factors, such as interleukin 10 (IL-10).

Among these, leptin and adiponectin are fundamental for metabolic and body composition regulation. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is an anti-inflammatory cytokine showing direct effects on mature adipocytes, decreasing leptin and increasing adiponectin secretion. IL-15 expression in WAT has never been addressed in cancer cachexia, while the effect of this paraneoplastic syndrome upon adipokine secretion remains controversial. We examined the expression of these factors by WAT, with special focus on the heterogeneous response of fat pads. Animals were assigned to a tumour-bearing group (Walker 256, TB, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9) or control group (C, <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6). Plasma leptin and adiponectin (RIA), as well as gene expression (real-time PCR) of leptin, adiponectin, interleukin 15 (IL-15), nuclear-factor kappaB (NFkappaB), and inhibitory protein kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha), were determined in the retroperitonial (RPAT) and epididymal (EAT) adipose tissue. Adiponectin and leptin mRNA levels were reduced in both depots studied (around 99% in RPAT and 78% and 96%, respectively, in EAT), as well as IL-15 expression (96% in RPAT, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 and 75% in EAT, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005).

The present results show that in advanced experimental cachexia WAT, capacity to produce the studied factors is compromised, and this effect is more pronounced in the RPAT.

Genes involved in lipid accumulation (PPAR-gamma, C/EBP-alpha, FAS, SCD-1 and CD36) were similarly affected. These changes occurred at specific times in the diurnal cycle, with distinctive amplitude and phase shifts. Proteomic profiling by iTRAQ quantified &#x0003e;1,500 hepatic proteins, confirmed these defects in lipid handling and also showed a general impact on mitochondria function. Plasma IL-6 levels progressively increased to ~120&#x000a0;pg/ml, and in all organs analysed, IL-6 signaling was activated. Pair-feeding experiments showed that these changes could not be attributed to reduced feed intake.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Cachexia in the C26 mouse model is associated with aberrant circadian regulation of metabolic pathways, especially lipid handling.

The upregulation of catabolic processes and concurrent reduction in anabolic pathways both contribute to weakened muscle and bone. However, the molecular progression of cachexia that drives these changes in bone metabolism and endocrinology is poorly understood.

Normal gluteus thickness was 30 (31, 36) mm and 29 (32, 38)&#x02009;mm in patients; normal psoas cross-sectional area (CSA) was 2,873 (2,708, 3,299)&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup> and in patients was 3,049 (2,561, 4,155)&#x02009;mm<sup>2</sup>.

We hypothesized that a central 5-HT2cR pathway regulates physiological gastrointestinal (GI) motor activity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The 5-HT2cR agonist, m-chlorophenylpiperazine hydrochloride (m-CPP) or fenfluramine, was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) to rats. GI motility was measured in rats by a strain gauge force transducer method. The effects of SB242084 (5-HT2cR antagonist), HS014 (melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) antagonist), SHU9119 (MC3/4R antagonist), neuropeptide Y (NPY), ghrelin, phentolamine hydrochloride (alpha-adrenergic receptor blocker), and hesperidine (the active flavonoid ingredient in Rikkunshito) on the GI motility induced by fenfluramine were examined.

The 5-HT2cR antagonist, but not the 5-HT1bR and 5-HT2bR antagonists, restored the fasted motor patterns in the antrum and duodenum of fenfluramine-treated rats. SB242084 also inhibited the decrease in plasma acyl ghrelin induced by fenfluramine. The MC4R and MC3/4R antagonists failed to modify the decreased motor activities induced by fenfluramine. In contrast, ghrelin and NPY restored the fasted motor patterns in the antrum and duodenum of fenfluramine-treated rats. Phentolamine and hesperidine, which stimulate the secretion of endogenous acyl ghrelin, restored the fasted motor activities in fenfluramine-treated rats.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results demonstrate direct neuroendocrine control over GI function by central 5-HT2c receptors, which inhibit ghrelin-NPY signalling.</p><p><bold>049</bold></p><p><bold>Akt activation is not reduced in the diaphragm of emphysematous hamsters</bold></p><p><bold>Hieronymus W.

Richard Dekhuijzen, Leo M.A. Heunks</bold></p><p>Pulmonary Diseases, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Diaphragm weakness in COPD patients is associated with loss of contractile protein. Protein loss results from an imbalance between protein breakdown and protein synthesis. We recently showed that increased protein breakdown is involved, since proteasome inhibition restores contractile protein content and improves diaphragm force generation in an animal model for COPD. However, modulation of pathways concerning protein synthesis was not studied. The aim of this study is to investigate the activation of Akt, an important promotor of protein synthesis, in the diaphragm of emphysematous hamsters (EH). In addition, we studied the effect of proteasome inhibition on Akt activation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Emphysema was induced by intratracheal instillation of elastase. Four groups were studied; normal hamster control (NH-Co), NH treated with Bortezomib i.v. (NH-Bt), EH-Co, and EH-Bt. Diaphragm was excised, and Western blotting and optical densitometry were used to determine cytoplasmic protein contents of total Akt and phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Content of p-Akt was 190% higher in diaphragm from EH-Co animals than in NH-Co (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Also, content of total Akt was higher in EH-Co diaphragm, 170% of NH-Co (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Total Akt and p-Akt levels in EH-Bt and NH-Bt were not significantly different from respective controls. The p-Akt to total Akt ratio did not significantly differ between groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Emphysema does not reduce Akt activation in the hamster diaphragm. Instead, absolute levels of activated Akt (p-Akt) are elevated in EH diaphragm. These findings support the concept that contractile protein loss results from increased proteolysis rather than from inhibited protein synthesis. Furthermore, unaffected Akt activation by bortezomib treatment suggests that the positive effects of bortezomib on contractile protein content result from reduced protein breakdown and not from enhanced protein synthesis.</p><p><bold>050</bold></p><p><bold>Inactivation of the MyD88 gene protects from cancer anorexia cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Johan Ruud</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Fredrik B&#x000e4;ckhed</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, David Engblom</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Anders Blomqvist</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Division of Cell Biology, Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Link&#x000f6;ping University, Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden; <sup>2</sup>Sahlgrenska Center for Cardiovascular and Metabolic Research/Wallenberg Laboratory, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden</p><p>The anorexia&#x02013;cachexia syndrome, characterized by a rise in energy expenditure that paradoxically is associated with loss of appetite and decreased food intake, contributes significantly to the morbidity and mortality in cancer. While the pathophysiology of cancer anorexia&#x02013;cachexia is poorly understood, evidence indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines are key mediators of this response. Although inflammation is recognized as an important component of cancer anorexia&#x02013;cachexia, the molecular inflammatory pathways involved are largely unknown. We addressed this issue in mice carrying a deletion of the gene encoding MyD88, the key intracellular adaptor molecule in Toll-like and interleukin-1 family receptor signaling. Wild-type and MyD88-deficient mice were transplanted subcutaneously with a syngenic methylcholanthrene-induced MCG 101 tumor, and daily food intake and body weights were recorded. While wild-type mice typically display reduced food intake at about 5&#x000a0;days after tumor transplantation and had lost 2% in body weight at the end of the experiment, MyD88-deficient mice did not develop anorexia&#x02013;cachexia despite similar tumor growth as the wild-type mice. These data show that MyD88-dependent mechanisms are involved in the metabolic derangement during cancer anorexia&#x02013;cachexia and suggest that innate immune signaling is important for the development of this syndrome.</p><p><bold>051</bold></p><p><bold>Age-related lean tissue loss is attenuated by treatment with a form of soluble activin receptor type IIB</bold></p><p><bold>Laura Hagerty, Jennifer L.

Frailty resulting from age-related lean tissue loss is correlated to an increase in falls and fractures and an increase in loss of independent living. Multiple TGF-beta superfamily ligands that negatively regulate muscle mass mediate their effects through the activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB). Previous studies in normal animals demonstrated that administration of a non-signaling decoy ActRIIB promotes gain of muscle mass. To examine whether treatment with a soluble ActRIIB could offset the aging-induced changes in lean tissue mass and strength, we examined the effects of RAP-435, a fusion protein comprised of an optimized extracellular domain of ActRIIB linked to a murine Fc, in aged mice.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Seventy-six-week-old male C57BL/6 mice were treated with either vehicle (VEH) or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg RAP-435 (RAP) for 8&#x000a0;weeks.

This was due to an increase in protein synthesis in skeletal muscle associated with attenuation of the elevated autophosphorylation of dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), eukaryotic initiation factor-2-alpha (eIF-2-alpha) and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2). There was also a decrease in protein degradation due to decreased activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and casapses-3 and -8. The effect of AT was attenuated by co-administration of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, and AT inhibited the increased zinc concentration in skeletal muscle with increasing weight loss.

The role of MAP/ERK kinase in the regulation of muscle mass is still debated. Data in the literature show that ERK inhibition prevents IGF1-induced muscle hypertrophy, while others demonstrate that inhibition of the ERK pathway results in a hypertrophic phenotype similar to that elicited by IGF1 treatment. The aim of the present study has been to evaluate the effects of ERK inhibition in two different experimental models of cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Tumor-bearing (TB) rats received 108 Yoshida AH-130 cells i.p. and were sacrificed 7&#x000a0;days after transplantation.

Administration of the ERK inhibitor PD98059 (3&#x000a0;mg/kg) to TB rats resulted in improved body and muscle weight loss. Similarly, PD98059 treatment (1&#x000a0;mg/kg) in TB mice partially prevented the loss of body weight, muscle mass, and strength. Moreover, PD98059 administration to TB mice resulted in decreased atrogin-1 muscle expression.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the present study, ERK inhibition reduced muscle wasting in experimental cancer cachexia, suggesting that this kinase may be considered a new therapeutic target.

The present study was designed to determine these mechanisms.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> During laparotomy, two electrodes were implanted in the rat stomach, and typical for gastroparesis, GES with Enterra parameters was applied for 1&#x000a0;h. Expression of digestive and hypothalamic hunger and satiety peptides was assayed. Presence of c-Fos protein in the stomach and in the brain with relation to ghrelin-producing cells or to catecholaminergic neurons, respectively, was studied by immunohistochemistry.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GES increased c-Fos in the gastric myenteric plexus and increased expression of ghrelin mRNA and protein in the stomach as well as plasma ghrelin level. In the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, GES increased c-Fos and agouti-related protein mRNA expression. GES reduced the number of c-Fos-positive cells throughout the nucleus of the solitary tract including catecholaminergic neurons.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This study shows that GES may improve appetite mainly via stimulation of ghrelin production and its downstream pathways in the hypothalamus, as well as by reducing activity of catecholaminergic brainstem neurons. These results suggest that GES with parameters used for treatment of gastroparesis could potentially improve appetite in patients with other pathological conditions characterized by chronic anorexia and cachexia.</p><p><bold>056</bold></p><p><bold>Effect of SUN11031 (a synthetic human ghrelin) on pulmonary and systemic abnormalities in the cigarette smoke-induced chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) model</bold></p><p><bold>Yoshiyuki Kamiide, Masako Sugiyama, Chihiro Tamaki, Tsuyoshi Matsuo, Hiromitsu Takagi, Mayumi Furuya</bold></p><p>Biomedical Research Laboratories, Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan</p><p>Cigarette smoking is well known as a major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and causes not only the pulmonary abnormalities but also the extrapulmonary pathophysiological changes such as malnutrition, loss of body weight (BW), systemic inflammation, and skeletal muscle wasting. Previously, it has been reported that ghrelin improves body composition and exercise tolerance in patients with COPD cachexia. We investigated whether ghrelin improves the respiratory function and catabolic changes in the animal model of COPD induced by chronic cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. Rats were exposed to CS or air twice a day and received SUN11031 (human ghrelin, manufactured by Asubio Pharma Co., Ltd., 1&#x000a0;mg/kg, subcutaneous, b.i.d.) for 12&#x000a0;weeks. BW and food intake were measured throughout the study. After 12&#x000a0;weeks exposure, respiratory function, pulmonary emphysema, and muscle strength were evaluated. Compared with the air-exposed rats, BW gain, food consumption, epididymal fat weight, and peak air flow were significantly lower, while lung capacity was significantly higher in the CS-exposed rats. The grip strength of the forelimb tended to be lowered by CS exposure. In contrast, SUN11031 significantly increased both BW gain and food efficiency, but not fat weight. SUN11031 also significantly improved peak air flow and lung capacity. Moreover, a trend for the improvement of grip strength was observed in the SUN11031-treated rats. These results suggest that SUN11031 may improve not only the energy balance but also the respiratory function and the systemic abnormality in COPD model induced by chronic CS exposure.</p><p><bold>057</bold></p><p><bold>Acyl ghrelin improves selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced gastrointestinal motility in rats</bold></p><p><bold>Miharu Ushikai</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Akihiro Asakawa</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Haruka Amitani</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Marie Sameshima</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Mizuki Hayashi</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Naoki Fujitsuka</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Akio Inui</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan; <sup>2</sup>TSUMURA Research Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are the common side effects caused by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and lead to early discontinuation of treatments in patients with depressive disorder.

GI motility was measured in conscious, freely moving rats by a strain gauge force transducer method. Plasma acyl ghrelin levels were determined by EIA. Phenol red retention in the stomach at 15&#x000a0;min was calculated to assess the gastric emptying. Effects of acyl ghrelin (and Rikkunshito, a traditional Japanese medicine which releases endogenous acyl ghrelin) on these functions were examined.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The fasted motor patterns in both the antrum and duodenum were disrupted by the treatments of SSRIs and replaced by the fed-like pattern. The motor activity was increased in the antrum, whereas decreased in the duodenum, and the duodenal phase III-like contractions of fasted motility, was decreased. All of the SSRIs significantly decreased plasma acyl ghrelin concentration. When acyl ghrelin or Rikkunshito was administered to fluvoxamine or fenfluramine-treated rats, the motor activity in the antrum was not changed, while the motor activity and the phase III-like contractions in the duodenum were significantly increased. In addition, acyl ghrelin or Rikkunshito improved the decrease in food intake and gastric emptying rate. The pretreatment with GHS-R antagonist (D-Lys3) GHRP-6 blocked the effects of Rikkunshito on theses parameters.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results indicate that SSRIs decrease plasma acyl ghrelin and induce GI motility similar to anorexigenic peptides.

The anorexigenic peptide alpha-MSH is believed to be crucially involved in the regulation of food intake. It has been proposed that blockade of its central physiological target, the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R), might provide a promising treatment strategy. This concept is supported by the fact that agouti-related protein (AgRP), the endogenous antagonist at the MC4-R, was found to affect two hallmark features of cachexia, namely to increase food intake and to reduce energy expenditure. Based on this rationale, we pursued the discovery and development of small-molecule MC4-R antagonists for the treatment of cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A recently discovered, selective and orally bioavailable MC4-R antagonist, which penetrates the blood&#x02013;brain barrier, was studied.

Specifically, stimulation of food intake and regulation of energy expenditure measured as oxygen consumption were investigated. Furthermore, using MC-4R-deficient mice, we confirmed that the effects of our compounds are indeed MC-4R mediated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Single and multiple oral administration of our compounds significantly increased food intake and decreased energy expenditure in wild-type mice. In MC-4R-deficient mice, however, these effects were absent.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We demonstrated that our small molecule MC-4R antagonists were orally effective on both food intake and energy expenditure, and that these effects were MC-4R mediated. These findings open up the possibility of treating two hallmarks of cachexia with one drug.</p><p><bold>060</bold></p><p><bold>A pharmacologically active monoclonal antibody against the human melanocortin-4 receptor as a possible treatment of cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Jean-Christophe Peter, Anne-Catherine Lecourt, Marjorie Weckering, G&#x000e9;raldine Zipfel, Karl G.

Consequently, peak tetanic in situ force production of tibialis anterior (TA) muscle was improved by 35% after treatment (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.03), without affecting the muscle&#x02019;s susceptibility to contraction-mediated injury (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48).

A key feature of cachexia is the progressive depletion of skeletal muscle, which occurs in concert with the loss of adipose tissue. Muscle wasting has long been postulated to be a key risk factor for cancer-related death, but to date, there has been no direct experimental research evidence to substantiate this hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that in two independent preclinical models of cancer cachexia, the colon-26 tumor-bearing mice and inhibin-alpha-deficient mice, pharmacological blockade of ActRIIB-mediated signaling pathway not only prevents muscle wasting but also reverses muscle loss, thereby significantly prolonging survival. We show that mechanistically, ActRIIB pathway antagonism is able to prevent the induction of critical components of the Ub-proteasome system in skeletal muscle and also stimulates muscle stem cell growth. These findings (1) establish a crucial link between the ActRIIB signaling activities and the pathogenesis of muscle wasting and cancer cachexia and (2) show that pharmacological antagonism of the ActRIIB pathway may hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>065</bold></p><p><bold>A myostatin decoy receptor prevents loss of muscle mass and function in cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Peter Bialek, Jascha Parkington, Paul Yaworsky, Carl Morris</bold></p><p>Tissue Repair, Wyeth, Cambridge, MA, USA</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cachexia is a complex syndrome which is characterized by decreased protein synthesis and increased protein degradation. Cytokines and other secreted factors are believed to mediate muscle wasting, although the exact mechanisms are not completely understood. Myostatin, a negative regulator of muscle mass and member of the TGF-beta/BMP superfamily, has been implicated in cachexia. To determine if myostatin activity is important for cachexia, we tested a soluble myostatin decoy receptor (ActRIIB-Fc) in a mouse ascites tumor model.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ten-week-old SCID female mice were injected with S180 cells to initiate ascites tumor formation or PBS. The mice were then subdivided into two cohorts and given weekly injections of vehicle or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg ActRIIB-Fc for 2&#x000a0;weeks.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> S180-induced cachexic mice lost 15% gastrocnemius and quadriceps muscle mass and showed a 27% decline in grip strength compared to controls after 2&#x000a0;weeks. However, cachexic mice treated with ActRIIB-Fc did not lose muscle mass or show decline in grip strength. Analysis of muscle extracts from cachexic mice revealed a ~25% increase in proteasome activity and a decrease in FOXO1 phosphorylation which was not reversed by ActRIIB-Fc treatment. However, the increased mRNA expression of muscle-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases, Murf-1, and atrogin/ MAFbx in the untreated cachexic mice was significantly reduced following ActRIIB-Fc treatment. Further, a maker of protein translation, 4EBP1, was increased in ActRIIB-Fc-treated mice compared to vehicle-treated cachexic mice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The data suggests that ActRIIB-Fc maintains muscle mass and function by balancing the catabolic activity during cachexia by increasing protein translation.</p><p><bold>066</bold></p><p><bold>Theophylline is able to partially revert cachexia in tumour-bearing rats</bold></p><p><bold>Mireia Olivan</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jochen Springer</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, S&#x000ed;lvia Busquets</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Anika Hartmann</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Maite Figueras</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Cibely Fontes de Oliveira</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Ventura da Silva P</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Angelica Sette</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Francisco J.

Several evidences suggest that enhanced activation of proteasomal degradative pathways underlies critical steps in the pathogenesis of DMD dystrophic process. We previously demonstrated that treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 rescued the protein levels and cell membrane localization of dystrophin and the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, an experimental model of DMD. This work was aimed to define the therapeutic potential of Velcade, a drug selectively blocking the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, in dystrophinopathies. Velcade is particularly intriguing since, being FDA-approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma, its side effects in humans are already known.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Dystrophic <italic>mdx</italic> mice were systemically administered Velcade (0.8&#x000a0;mg/kg) over a 2-week period.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Velcade proved efficient in inhibiting proteasome activation, as well as serum CK level increase. Moreover, it reverted the membrane expression of dystrophin and DGC members, prevented both NF-kB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory reaction, enhanced muscle regeneration, and improved the dystrophic phenotype by increasing muscle CSA and reducing the number of both centralized nuclei and necrotic fibers.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In the present work, we reported that Velcade-induced proteasome inhibition partially prevents muscle degeneration in dystrophic mice and promotes the expression and membrane localization of dystrophin and dystrophin-associated proteins. Future studies will investigate the efficacy of Velcade in combination with other agents, such as corticosteroids, as well as their effects on muscle strength and functional motility.</p><p><bold>068</bold></p><p><bold>The fast skeletal troponin activator, CK-2017357, increases skeletal muscle force and reduces muscle fatigue in vitro and in situ</bold></p><p><bold>Alan J. Russell, Ken Lee, Jim J. Hartman, Alex Muci, Bradley Morgan, Fady Malik</bold></p><p>Cytokinetics Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA</p><p>CK-2017357 is a member of a class of fast skeletal troponin activators that were identified by high throughput screening of skeletal sarcomere preparations. We sought to understand how this compound altered isometric force development in skinned and live muscle fibers. Treatment of skinned muscle fibers with 0.1&#x02013;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CK-2017357 caused a left shift of the force&#x02013;pCa relationship without altering the maximum force, consistent with a calcium-sensitizing effect on force production. In rat flexor digitorum brevis (FDB) muscle in vitro, CK-2017357 (10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M) caused increases in sub-tetanic force (150% at 10&#x000a0;Hz) without altering maximum force. Similar experiments were performed using rat extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle in situ, where nervous and vascular connections were left intact and the muscle was stimulated via the peroneal nerve. Infusions of CK-2017357 up to 10&#x000a0;mg/kg increased sub-tetanic force (200% at 30&#x000a0;Hz). One cause of muscle fatigue is reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. We tested whether CK-2017357 would alter the rate of fatigue in FDB fibers. Muscle was pretreated with 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M CK-2017357 and stimulated at a frequency giving 50% maximal force every 6&#x000a0;s for 15&#x000a0;min (30&#x000b0;C). Treatment significantly reduced the rate of fatigue (terminal force, 33.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5% vs 53.9&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5%). In summary, we have identified a skeletal troponin activator that sensitizes the sarcomere to calcium, increases sub-maximal force development, and reduces fatigue. We believe that this may translate to improved physical power and efficiency in diseases where muscle function is compromised due to injury, disease, or age.</p><p><bold>069</bold></p><p><bold>Formoterol: a potential therapeutic use in cancer wasting</bold></p><p><bold>M&#x000ed;ram Toledo</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, S&#x000ed;lvia Busquets</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, S&#x000f2;nia Sirisi</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Marcel Orp&#x000ed;</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Roberto Serpe</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Joana Coutinho</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Raquel Mart&#x000ed;nez</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Francisco J.

Animals were treated with 0.4, 1 or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg/day imidapril; 0.5, 2, 5 or 50&#x000a0;mg/kg/day bisoprolol; 0.3 or 3&#x000a0;mg/kg/day MT-102; or placebo. Food intake and locomotor activity per day were assessed before tumor inoculation and on day&#x000a0;11 of the 16-day protocol. Weight and body composition (NMR scan) were assessed on day&#x000a0;0 and after sacrifice (maximum day&#x000a0;16, without tumor).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Animals of all groups showed similar baseline values for weight, body composition and heart function. All imidapril and bisoprolol doses, as well as low-dose MT-102, significantly reduced loss of lean tissue mass. Only high-dose MT-102 induced lean tissue gain compared to baseline. The same pattern was found for body weight overall. Imidapril did not improve quality of life (food intake and spontaneous activity). The higher doses of bisoprolol and both doses of MT-102 did improve quality of life. The two doses of MT-102 had the best results for physical activity. Mortality was higher in imidapril-treated groups compared to placebo. Five and 50&#x000a0;mg/kg/day bisoprolol significantly improved survival, as did high-dose MT-102. Low-dose MT-102 displayed a strong trend (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.064) (see Table).

Uric acid is a danger signal and associated with inflammation. In chronic heart failure, high serum uric acid levels are associated with metabolic illness and poor survival. We hypothesised that xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibition can reduce tissue wasting and improve survival in cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Rats (weight approximately 200&#x000a0;g) were inoculated intra-peritoneally with AH-130 hepatoma cells and treated with 4&#x000a0;mg/kg/day (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) and 40&#x000a0;mg/kg/day (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12) oxypurinol (Oxy), 40&#x000a0;mg/kg/day (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11) allopurinol (Allo) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;49).

Weight and body composition (NMR scan) were assessed on day&#x000a0;0 and day&#x000a0;16 after sacrifice (without tumour). XO activity for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed by EPR after purification of XO. Activity was assessed without Oxy or Allo. Proteasome activity was measured by turnover of flurogenic substrates in gastrocnemius homogenates.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Wasting of both fat and lean tissue was significantly reduced (see Table) by 4&#x000a0;mg/kg/day oxypurinol and to a somewhat lesser degree by allopurinol.

Feeding these people has little effect on their weight or survival.</p><p><bold>Purpose:</bold> The purpose of this study is to report a systematic review of the evidence base that can inform dietary advice for patients with CCS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Searches were conducted of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CINAHL databases for publications about diet and cancer patients off treatment with symptoms of CCS. Limits were English language, 1998 to September 2008, and adults. Seven hundred eighteen abstracts were assessed against inclusion/exclusion criteria, and 90 were selected for full-text independent examination by two researchers. Information, from 60 papers, was extracted, quality assessed, thematically analyzed, and presented as a narrative description.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Two dominant perspectives emerged. The majority of authors advocated a nutrition dense diet, achieved through (1) education on the fortification of foods and (2) advice to feed frequently. The alternative approach was to advise the patient to &#x0201c;eat what they want.&#x0201d; There is little robust evidence to justify either approach as able to deliver on the objectives they aim to achieve. Research is needed to establish which subgroups of weight-losing cancer patients can benefit from a nutrition dense diet.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> A new model for nutritional care with non-traditional objectives, such as mitigation of eating-related distress, may help identify patients with CCS for whom feeding is not futile. It could also facilitate optimal nutritional intake within the confines of the patient&#x02019;s (1) disease process and treatment, (2) coping approach, and (3) beliefs about food.</p><p><bold>075</bold></p><p><bold><sc>l</sc></bold><bold>-Carnitine induces recovery of liver lipid metabolism in cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Renata Silv&#x000e9;rio</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Alessandro Laviano</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Filippo Rossi Fanelli</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Marilia Seelaender</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cancer Metabolism Research Group, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, University of S&#x000e3;o Paulo, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil; <sup>2</sup>Department of Clinical Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy</p><p>Cachexia is a chronic inflammatory syndrome, characterised by weight loss and abnormalities in intermediary metabolism. Disruption of liver lipid metabolism, comprising higher uptake of long-chain fatty acids (LCFA), along with diminished oxidation and incorporation into very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL), aggravate cachexia. <sc>l</sc>-Carnitine is required for the transport of LCFA into the mitochondria, and cachectic patients present decreased plasma carnitine concentration. <sc>l</sc>-Carnitine supplementation is adopted in the treatment of many diseases, and we sought to examine whether cachectic rats would benefit from this strategy. Rats were inoculated with the Walker 256 carcinosarcoma and divided into two groups: supplemented with <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (1&#x000a0;g/Kg, for 28&#x000a0;days; TBC) and control (receiving saline; TB).

It has been show that creatine supplementation in a healthy condition leads to increased muscular energy content and lean body mass. We have investigated whether creatine supplementation in a cancer-induced cachectic condition affects muscular performance and body composition. Male CD2F1 mice, 5&#x02013;6&#x000a0;weeks of age, were divided into body weight-matched groups: (1) control, (2) tumour-bearing and (3) tumour-bearing receiving creatine (10&#x000a0;g&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> food). Tumours were induced by s.c. inoculation with murine colon adenocarcinoma (C26) cells. Food intake, body mass and tumour size were monitored. At day&#x000a0;20 after tumour/vehicle inoculation, animals were sacrificed, and muscle function was tested ex vivo. Creatine supplementation did not result in differences in organ and skeletal muscle weights, nor in changes in maximal isometric force. In contrast, creatine supplementation resulted in an increase in endurance capacity of the muscle. There was a decrease in loss of maximal force during an intermittent exercise series of high intensity. No differences in glycogen and high-energy phosphates were found. The muscular hydration level was decreased in cachectic mice and partially attenuated by creatine supplementation. Therefore, the observed increase in relative performance capacity might be linked to an improved muscular hydration level. In conclusion, no effects on absolute force output were observed after creatine supplementation, but we clearly demonstrated that the loss of relative muscular functionality during an intermittent exercise series in a murine cachexia model could be partially counteracted by creatine supplementation.</p><p><bold>077</bold></p><p><bold>Appetite enhancement and weight gain by peripheral tyrosine kinase receptor (TrkB) agonists in non-human primates</bold></p><p><bold>John Chia-Yang Lin, David Tsao, Joyce Chou, Rodnie Rosete, Arnon Rosenthal</bold></p><p>Rinat, Pfizer Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA</p><p>Loss of function mutations in the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or tyrosine kinase receptor TrkB results in hyperphagia and obesity in human and rodents. Conversely, peripheral or central stimulation of TrkB by its natural ligands BDNF or NT4 reduced body weight and food intake in mice (Tsao et al., Endocrinology 149:1038, 2008), supporting the idea that TrkB is a key anorexigenic signal. Here, we will describe the surprising discovery that in non-human primates, TrkB agonists were anorexigenic when applied centrally, but unexpectedly orexigenic, leading to gain in appetite, body weight, fat deposits, and serum leptin levels, when given peripherally (Lin et al., PLoS ONE 3(4):e1900, 2008). The orexigenic and anabolic effects of peripherally administered TrkB agonists appear to be dose dependent, not associated with fluid retention nor with evidence of receptor downregulation. Furthermore, changes in several serum biomarkers in response to TrkB agonist treatment suggest the possible mechanisms of appetite and weight regulation via peripheral TrkB activation. Our findings indicate that TrkB signaling exerts dual control on energy homeostasis in the primates that could be targeted for the treatment of either cachexia or obesity.</p><p><bold>078</bold></p><p><bold>Acetate of megestrol: new evidences supporting its use in cancer cachexia.

Different nutraceuticals, i.e., w3 fatty acids of marine origin, have been proposed to counteract muscle wasting during cancer. The aim of the present investigation was to examine the anti-wasting effects of other nutraceuticals such as geninstein (soybean), resveratrol (grapes), theophylline (tea), epigallocatechin gallate (tea), and diallyl sulfide (garlic).

This is particularly exacerbated in aged muscles along with a slow rate of muscle recovery. This is an undesirable consequence of hospitalization in the elderly. In this study, we evaluated the effects of HMB (beta-hydroxyl-beta-methylbutyrate), a leucine metabolite, on muscle recovery following hind limb suspension (HLS) in aged (&#x0003e;32&#x000a0;months) Fisher Brown Norway (FBN) rats. Male rats were fed either control 2018S chow (CON) or Ca-HMB (340&#x000a0;mg/kg bw)-supplemented chow (HMB) over a 14-day HLS (unloading) period, followed by recovery (reloading) for 7 or 14&#x000a0;days. Unloading caused significant reduction in muscle force in all groups. Neither groups recovered their baseline force even after 14&#x000a0;days of reloading, and both groups lost similar amounts of muscle mass. However, histological staining revealed that during recovery, the HMB groups had significantly larger muscle fiber cross-section area (1,034.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;150.3&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) than the CON (951.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;298&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>) , indicating muscle hypertrophy. Along this line, the HMB groups also displayed improved satellite cell activation (BrdU positive nuclei) upon reloading (HMB, 8.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2%; CON, 4.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2%). TUNEL assays revealed the HMB groups to have significantly fewer apoptotic nuclei than the CON (HMB, 10&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5%; CON, 18&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7%). Thus, administration of HMB appears to induce muscle fiber hypertrophy as well as protection against muscle atrophy, possibly by protecting myonuclei from apoptosis. This study demonstrates the potential for using HMB to facilitate muscle recovery following extended limb immobilization.</p><p><bold>081</bold></p><p><bold>Fish oil and leucine decrease plasma calcium levels in tumour-bearing mice concommitant with changes in plasma levels of interleukin (IL) 6, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and interleukin (IL) 4</bold></p><p><bold>Klaske van Norren</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Joyce Faber</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Josep M.

Development of hypercalcaemia involves inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 and cyclooxygenase-2, while IL-4 has been shown to inhibit osteoclast formation in mice, thus reducing plasma calcium (pCa<sup>2+</sup>). A specific nutritional combination (SNC) of high protein, leucine (Leu), fish oil (FO) and oligosaccharides increased muscle performance and reduced proinflammatory cytokine levels in a tumour-bearing mouse model.

Insulin resistance is commonly reported in cancer cachexia, and increased protein intakes are recommended to favour protein anabolism and prevent muscle loss. We tested whether a sustained, physiological elevation of circulating amino acids would interfere with glucose metabolism.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Insulin resistance was assessed in six men with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and seven age-matched controls with healthy BMI using the hyperinsulinemic (1.25&#x000a0;mU/kg&#x02009;LBM&#x02009;min), euglycemic (5.5&#x000a0;mM), isoaminoacidemic clamp (IsoAA) for 2.5&#x000a0;h, followed by 2.5&#x000a0;h of hyperaminoacidemia (HyperAA) at postprandial levels. Glucose kinetics was quantified by tracer (3H3-glucose) methodology.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> NSCLC patients had 7.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.2% weight loss, lower muscle mass, higher CRP and GH levels and lower serum prealbumin and urea than controls. Fasting plasma glucose, insulin and branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) and glucose rate of appearance (Ra, production) and disappearance (Rd, uptake) did not differ. During IsoAA, insulin reached 436&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;33 in NSCLC vs. 551&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;36&#x000a0;pM in controls (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). Glucose production was equally suppressed in both, but glucose uptake was less stimulated in NSCLC (6.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7 vs. 8.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8&#x000a0;mg/LBM&#x02009;min, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.038, adjusted for insulin) indicating peripheral insulin resistance. During HyperAA (732&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;70&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M of total BCAA), serum insulin and glucose production did not change significantly. However, glucose uptake increased similarly in both groups, Rd remaining lower in NSCLC (7.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.8 vs. 10.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7&#x000a0;mg/LBM&#x02009;min, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.027).

However, in both these and in insulin-sensitive controls, providing a high availability of amino acids, equivalent to a physiological postprandial state (~25&#x000a0;g protein), did not interfere with insulin action on glucose metabolism, rather it may enhance glucose uptake.

We previously demonstrated that rosiglitazone (RGZ) improved insulin sensitivity and body weight and suppressed quadriceps mRNA of E3 ligases Atrogin-1 and MuRF-1 before the onset of overt cachexia in tumor-bearing mice. Additionally, adipose IL-6 mRNA was decreased, and adiponectin mRNA was increased. The positive effects of RGZ early in cachexia pathogenesis led us to test the hypothesis that RGZ would also improve cachexia outcomes in late stage cancer.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Male CD2F1 mice were inoculated with 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;106 colon-26 adenocarcinoma cells and treated with 10&#x000a0;mg/kg/day RGZ or vehicle (PBS). RGZ-treated mice were fed ad libitum or pair-fed to PBS-treated mice.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> RGZ delayed the onset of weight loss by 2&#x000a0;days, decreased total weight loss, and increased white and brown adipose mass compared to PBS-treated mice. Pair-feeding negated the effects of RGZ on body weight and white adipose mass, and decreased quadriceps muscle mass. However, the RGZ-induced increase in brown adipose mass was maintained in the pair-fed group. Insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance, muscle fiber diameter, muscle strength, plasma IL-6, and quadriceps E3 ligase mRNA were not different between groups at the end of the study.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Although RGZ delayed weight loss and attenuated adipose atrophy, it did not improve muscle mass, strength, or proteolytic gene expression in severely cachectic mice. Some effects of RGZ appear to be dependent on the increased food intake associated with RGZ, emphasizing the importance of targeting both dysregulated metabolism and anorexia for optimal cachexia treatment.</p><p><bold>087</bold></p><p><bold>Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-&#x003b1; (PPAR-&#x003b1;) agonist fenofibrate ameliorates arthritis-induced upregulation of proteolysis and regenerative response in the gastrocnemius muscle of rats</bold></p><p><bold>Estibaliz Castillero, Ana Isabel Mart&#x000ed;n, Maria L&#x000f3;pez-Mendui&#x000f1;a, Asuncion L&#x000f3;pez-Calder&#x000f3;n, Maria Angeles Villan&#x000fa;a</bold></p><p>Departamento de Fisiolog&#x000ed;a, Facultad de Medicina, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Madrid, Spain</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Adjuvant induced arthritis is an animal model of chronic inflammation that leads to marked skeletal muscle atrophy, activation of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and regenerative response.

Although Foxo is largely regulated in skeletal muscle through its phosphorylation and inactivation by Akt, we recently demonstrated that Foxo-dependent transcription can be inhibited by heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70). However, the precise mechanism responsible for this inhibition remains unknown. Because acetylation of Hsp70 has been shown to regulate its function in other cell types, the current study sought to determine whether Hsp70 is acetylated in skeletal muscle, and whether this contributes to its repression of Foxo transactivation. Immunoprecipitation of total acetylated proteins from whole muscle revealed Hsp70 to be acetylated during weight bearing conditions, which was significantly reduced following 3&#x000a0;days of immobilization. Subsequent co-immunoprecipitation experiments revealed binding of Hsp70 to the histone acetyltransferase p300. To determine if acetylation of Hsp70 is mediated via p300, and whether this affects Hsp70-mediated repression of Foxo activity, we subsequently transfected whole muscle with a WT p300 expression plasmid or a p300 mutant lacking its acetyltransferase activity (p300DY) plus Hsp70 and a Foxo-responsive reporter prior to weight bearing or immobilization conditions. Expression of WT p300, but not p300 DY, prevented the decrease in Hsp70 acetylation in response to immobilization. Importantly, expression of the p300DY reversed the inhibitory effect of Hsp70 on Foxo transactivation. These findings suggest that modulating the acetylation status of Hsp70 could be an important mechanism of Foxo regulation in skeletal muscle.</p><p><bold>089</bold></p><p><bold>Toll-like receptor 4 mediates muscle wasting</bold></p><p><bold>Alexander Doyle, Yi-Ping Li</bold></p><p>Department of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, USA</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Cachectic muscle wasting is a complication of inflammatory diseases. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is known to stimulate muscle catabolism by upregulating specific ubiquitin ligases via inducing inflammatory cytokines. Here, we investigated the direct stimulation of muscle protein degradation by LPS via the activation of muscle Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4).</p><p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> Incubation of C2C12 myotubes with the TLR4 ligand LPS (100&#x000a0;ng/ml) for 48&#x000a0;h resulted in myosin heavy chain loss and thinner myotubes. Expression of atrogin-1/MAFbx was upregulated by LPS within 1&#x000a0;h and peaked at 2&#x000a0;h. On the other hand, expression of MuRF1 was initially downregulated at 1 and 2&#x000a0;h, and then upregulated at 3&#x000a0;h. To understand the signaling mechanism of the LPS actions, we observed that LPS activated p38 MAPK and AKT within 30&#x000a0;min. The latter resulted in hyperphosphorylation and inactivation of Foxo1/3, which could explain the downregulation of MuRF1. Pretreatment of C2C12 myotubes with p38 inhibitor SB202190 blocked LPS upregulation of atrogin-1/MAFbx, but not MuRF1. Conversely, overexpression of active MKK6 (MKK6bE) upregulated atrogin-1/MAFbx expression. TLR4 knockdown with siRNA abolished LPS activation of p38 and AKT. In mice, pre-administration of SB202190 or TLR4 gene knockout blocked LPS upregulation of atrogin-1/MAFbx expression and stimulation of tyrosine release by muscle.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> LPS direct activation of muscle TLR4 accelerates muscle protein degradation by upregulating muscle E3 ligases. TLR4/p38 signaling upregulates atrogin-1/MAFbx expression and contributes significantly to LPS-induced muscle loss.

Stewart</bold></p><p>I.R.M. John Dalton Building, MMU, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK</p><p><bold>Introduction and aim:</bold> Sirt1 is a key regulator of cell defences and survival in response to stress. Deletion of Sirt1 abolishes the increase in lifespan induced by calorie restriction or sublethal cytokine stress, indicating that Sirt1 promotes longevity and survival. We have demonstrated that sublethal TNF-&#x003b1; (1.25&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) administration inhibits myotube formation, and co-incubation with IGF-I (1.5&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) facilitates C2 myoblast death rather than rescuing differentiation. Higher dose TNF-&#x003b1; (10&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) resulted in significant apoptosis, which was rescued by IGF-I (1.5&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; 50% rescue; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). We aimed to investigate the role of Sirt1 in the conflicting roles of IGF-I.</p><p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> qRT-PCR revealed that Sirt1 expression was elevated in myoblasts following incubation of 10&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> TNF-&#x003b1; or 1.25&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> TNF-&#x003b1; plus IGF-I (5&#x02013;7.2-fold increases vs. control; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Of TNF-&#x003b1;, 10&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> induced ~21&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.7% apoptosis, which was reduced (~50%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) when administered with IGF-I. Similarly, Sirt1 expression was elevated following 10&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> TNF-&#x003b1; administration, but was reduced (~30%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in the presence of IGF-I. Incubations that induced the greatest myoblast stress/damage resulted in elevated Sirt1 expression; we therefore investigated the effects of Sirt1 gene silencing. Of TNF-&#x003b1;, 10&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> or co-incubation of 1.25&#x000a0;ng&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> TNF-&#x003b1;/IGF-I resulted in apoptosis (20.33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.08% and 19&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.65%), which was increased when myoblasts were pre-administered with Sirt1 siRNA (31&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.65% and 27.33&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.52%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

Its pathophysiology and final outcome is complex and depends not only on the extent of muscle damage but also on the efficiency of muscle regeneration, which is triggered by muscle injury. Muscle regeneration starts from the mytotically and metabolically quiescent satellite cells. After injury, they are released from their location and enter the cell cycle as mononuclear myoblasts. Muscle mass formed in the regeneration process critically depends on the myoblast proliferation, and since critical illness is accompanied by extensive cytokine signaling, it is important to know how this signaling affects the mechanisms participating in the myoblast proliferation.</p><p><bold>Aim and methods:</bold> A great body of evidence supports the concept that with regard to the cytokine signaling, major response of the skeletal muscle is IL-6 secretion. IL-6 promotes myoblast proliferation and is an essential regulator of satellite cell-mediated muscle hypertrophy. Therefore, it is very likely that it plays an important role in muscle regeneration. In this study, we followed the effects of pro-inflammatory (TNF-alpha and LPS) and anti-inflammatory factors (dexamethasone and IL-10) on the IL-6 secretion from the cultured human myoblasts. The effects on proliferating myoblasts were compared with the effects on non-proliferating myotubes.</p><p><bold>Results and conclusion:</bold> Pro-inflammatory factors TNF-alpha- and LPS stimulated IL-6 release in both myoblasts and myotubes. Anti-inflammatory factor dexamethasone suppressed constitutive secretion of IL-6, while IL-10 decreased secretion of IL-6 but only in myoblasts. Our results suggest complex and differentiation stage-specific control of IL-6 from precursors of human muscle regeneration.</p><p><bold>094</bold></p><p><bold>Systemic inflammation and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) dependent muscle atrophy in a mouse model of acute pulmonary inflammation</bold></p><p><bold>Ramon C.

The aim of this study was to address whether acute pulmonary inflammation is sufficient to induce systemic inflammation and loss of muscle mass, and whether local NF-kB activity is required for muscle atrophy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> C57/bl6 mice received a single bolus of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> LPS by intra-tracheal (IT) instillation to induce acute pulmonary inflammation or 0.9% NaCl as a control.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Neutrophil infiltration in the lungs was maximal at 72&#x000a0;h and almost completely resolved at 120&#x000a0;h post-LPS. Loss of bodyweight (bw) and muscle weight (mw) was maximal 48&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h post-LPS (10&#x02013;15% decrease), and recovery was almost complete 120&#x000a0;h post-LPS. Assessment of MuRF1 and atrogin-1 in muscle revealed a transient increase in mRNA abundance (24&#x02013;72&#x000a0;h post-LPS), preceding maximal loss of mw. Pair-fed experiments revealed that reduced food intake was responsible for only a minor part of the changes observed in bw, mw, and Atrogin-1/MuRF1 expression. Systemic inflammation was evidenced by increased circulating levels of a number of cytokines and chemokines, as well as NF-kB activation in circulating neutrophils and peripheral tissues including skeletal muscle measured in NF-kB-luciferase reporter mice, which was verified by increased KC (IL-8) and IkBa expression. Importantly, muscle specific abrogation of NF-kB signaling strongly attenuated MuRF1 expression and loss of muscle mass following IT-LPS instillation in transgenic mice.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data demonstrate that acute pulmonary inflammation induces systemic inflammation, and that subsequent muscular NF-kB activation contributes to muscle atrophy, potentially via the induction of MuRF1.</p><p><bold>095</bold></p><p><bold>Morphological and metabolic responses of C2C12 myotubes following food deprivation and refeeding</bold></p><p><bold>Aur&#x000e9;lia Defour</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Josiane Castells</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Odile Sabido</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Etienne Lefai</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Daniel Bechet</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Damien Freyssenet</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Laboratoire de Physiologie de l&#x02019;Exercice, EA 4338, Universit&#x000e9; Jean Monnet, Saint Etienne, PRES Universit&#x000e9; de Lyon, France; <sup>2</sup>INSERM U870, INRA UMR1235, R&#x000e9;gulations M&#x000e9;taboliques, Nutrition, et Diab&#x000e8;tes, Universit&#x000e9; Lyon 1, Oullins, PRES Universit&#x000e9; de Lyon, France; <sup>3</sup>INRA UMR 1019, Unit&#x000e9; Nutrition Humaine, Centre Clermont-Ferrand-Theix, St. Gen&#x000e8;s Champanelle, France</p><p>Skeletal muscle is a prominent tissue involved in the regulation of metabolic homeostasis by its capacity to oxidize fatty acids and glucose. To test the adaptations of skeletal muscle cells following food deprivation, we developed an in vitro experimental model of C2C12 myotubes submitted to a metabolic challenge consisting in 4&#x000a0;h of food deprivation followed by 20&#x000a0;h of refeeding. During the time course of this metabolic challenge, we determined the morphological and metabolic responses of C2C12 myotubes. Myotube area decreased progressively (~20% at 4&#x000a0;h) during food deprivation and increased progressively to reach control values 18&#x000a0;h after refeeding. Accordingly, the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, which is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, decreased and increased in a time-dependant manner during food deprivation (~75% at 4&#x000a0;h) and refeeding (~500% at 4&#x000a0;h), respectively. Refeeding was accompanied by a strong increase in glucose consumption (~400% at 15&#x000a0;min), which progressively decreased to control level 20&#x000a0;h after refeeding. During this period, glucose metabolism, which was initially oxidative, progressively switched to a glycolytic metabolism (~35%). Furthermore, food deprivation was accompanied by a transient decrease (~20% at 15&#x000a0;min) in hexokinase and citrate synthase activities, which recovered progressively during food deprivation and refeeding. The expression of sirtuin 1, a NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase, potentially involved in the regulation of hexokinase expression, decreased during food deprivation (~40% at 4&#x000a0;h). We are currently assessing the contribution of sirtuin 1 in these morphological and metabolic adaptations.</p><p><bold>096</bold></p><p><bold>Redox balance and carbonylated proteins in limb muscles and heart of cachectic rats</bold></p><p><bold>Judith Marin-Corral</bold><sup><bold>1,2</bold></sup><bold>, Cibely C.

Furthermore, the nature of the oxidatively modified proteins was also identified in these muscles. Reactive carbonyls, hydroxynonenal (HNE)-, and malondialdehyde (MDA)-protein adducts and antioxidant enzyme levels were determined in limb muscles and heart of cachectic (7&#x000a0;days after inoculation of Yoshida A H-130 ascites hepatoma) and control rats. Moreover, carbonylated proteins were identified (proteomics), and fiber-type composition was evaluated (morphometry) in these muscles. In cachectic rats, compared to the controls, (1) HNE- and MDA-protein adducts levels were greater in gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior, soleus, and heart; (2) in the gastrocnemius, type II fiber size was reduced, and the intensity of carbonylated protein immunostaining was significantly greater in these fibers; and (3) proteins involved in glycolysis, ATP production and distribution, carbon dioxide hydration, muscle contraction, and mitochondrial metabolism were significantly more carbonylated in limb muscles and heart. Cancer cachexia alters redox balance in fast- and slow-twitch limb muscles and heart of rats, inducing increased oxidative modifications of key proteins involved in muscle structure and function. Additionally, it induces a reduction in type II fiber size in the gastrocnemius, which is associated with increased protein oxidation.</p><p><bold>097</bold></p><p><bold>Impact of exercise training on myostatin expression in the myocardium and skeletal muscle in a chronic heart failure model and patients with chronic heart failure (CHF)</bold></p><p><bold>Karsten Lenk, Volker Adams, Axel Linke, Robert Schur, Sandra Erbs, Gerhard Schuler</bold></p><p>Department of Cardiology, Heart Center, Leipzig, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In terminal chronic heart failure (CHF), elevated cytokines and cachexia are often observed. Several studies documented that exercise training exerts beneficial effects on skeletal muscle in this setting.

Furthermore the effects of exercise training on myostatin in patients with CHF were examined.</p><p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> In an animal model of CHF (LAD ligation model), protein expression of myostatin was elevated 2.4-fold in the skeletal muscle and more than four times in the myocardium as compared to control. Exercise training on a treadmill over 4&#x000a0;weeks lead to a significant reduction of myostatin protein expression in the skeletal muscle and the myocardium of CHF-animals back to baseline levels. In differentiated C2C12 cells, TNF-&#x003b1; induced the expression of myostatin through a p38MAPK-dependent pathway under participation of NF-kB. In patients with CHF, exercise training lead to a significant reduction of myostatin in the skeletal muscle compared to controls.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> These alterations of myostatin expression seen under exercise training in the skeletal and heart muscle could be one possible mechanism explaining the beneficial anti-catabolic effects of exercise training in CHF.</p><p><bold>098</bold></p><p><bold>Skeletal muscle transcriptional responses to short-term resistance exercise greatly differ among individuals</bold></p><p><bold>Andrew J.

Designing new strategies that prevent muscle wasting following immobilization is of major importance to maintain autonomy and to reduce public health care costs. Immobilization is characterized by a concomitant activation of the ubiquitin (Ub)-proteasome-dependent proteolytic system and of the mitochondria-associated apoptotic pathway. Increased oxidative stress and inflammatory response also occur in immobilized skeletal muscle. We evaluated the role of curcumin on muscle atrophy in immobilized animals. This compound exhibits anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties and has been reported to block proteasome activation in intact animals.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Wistar rats were subjected to unilateral hindlimb immobilization for 8&#x000a0;days, and the contralateral muscle of the non-casted leg was used as a control. Half of the animals received a daily administration of curcumin (1&#x000a0;mg/kg, i.p.). Proteolytic and apoptotic pathways were studied in gastrocnemius muscles.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Curcumin did not reduce immobilization-induced muscle atrophy. Similarly, the increase amount of ubiquitinated conjugates and the increased caspase-3 activity that both prevail in immobilized muscles were unchanged in curcumin-treated rats. By contrast, curcumin suppressed the increased chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome and apoptosome activities in the immobilized muscles.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The lack of effect of curcumin on muscle wasting in immobilized muscles suggests that curcumin does not inhibit rate-limiting steps for muscle atrophy. Alternatively, the data may suggest that the i.p. mode of administration of curcumin does not provide enough biologically active metabolites on the signaling pathways of muscle proteolysis.</p><p><bold>100</bold></p><p><bold>Loss of USP19 increases transcription of myofibrillar proteins in L6 muscle cells and decreases muscle wasting in response to denervation in mice</bold></p><p><bold>Priyanka Sundaram</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Zhiyu Pang</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Miao Miao</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Nathalie Bedard</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Tamara Moore</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Patricia L.

We previously showed that the USP19 DUB is induced in various conditions of muscle atrophy including cancer. We tested the effects of loss of USP19 in muscles cells and transgenic mice.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Methods include RNAi of USP19 in muscle cells and gene inactivation in mouse.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Depletion of USP19 by siRNA in L6 myotubes resulted in 1.5&#x02013;2.5-fold increases in protein levels of myosin heavy chain (MHC), actin, troponin T, and tropomyosin. USP19 depletion also increased MHC and tropomyosin mRNA levels, suggesting that this effect is due to increased transcription. Consistent with this, USP19 depletion increased myogenin protein and mRNA levels by ~2-fold. Lowering myogenin using siRNA prevented the increase in MHC and tropomyosin upon USP19 depletion, indicating that myogenin mediated the increase in myofibrillar proteins. Dexamethasone or TNF-&#x003b1; treatment lowered MHC and increased USP19. USP19 siRNA reversed the suppression of MHC by these agents. Mice lacking USP19 were grossly normal, but lost 25&#x02013;53% less mass in gastrocnemius/tibialis anterior muscles than WT mice upon denervation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These studies demonstrate for the first time a role for a DUB in muscle wasting. Interestingly, the induction of USP19 in wasting appears to suppress synthesis of myofibrillar proteins, indicating that the ubiquitin system not only mediates the increased protein breakdown but also is involved in the decreased protein synthesis seen in atrophying skeletal muscle.</p><p><bold>101</bold></p><p><bold>Structural remodeling of human skeletal muscle with chronic inactivity</bold></p><p><bold>Marco V.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms of human skeletal muscle remodeling in chronic disuse.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Two paradigms of disuse were used for this study: unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) and bed rest (BR). Nine males (aged 22.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.8&#x000a0;years) participated to a 23-day ULLS study, while ten males (aged 22.3&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.2&#x000a0;years) took part to a 35-day BR study. Evidence of skeletal muscle remodeling was obtained by measuring vastus lateralis (VL) muscle fibre fascicle length (Lf) using ultrasound. To investigate the mechanism underlying this structural alteration, focal adhesion kinase activity and content (FAK, an integrin-associated phosphoprotein involved in mechanotransduction) were measured on VL muscle biopsy samples obtained in the same individuals. Since FAK is an upstream modulator of protein synthesis, concomitant fractional rate of protein synthesis was measured after infusion of stable isotopes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> VL Lf decreased by 5.5% after just 10&#x000a0;days of unilateral lower limb suspension (ULLS) and by 9% after 35&#x000a0;days of bedrest. This decrease in Lf, indicating a rapid loss of sarcomere in series, was associated with a concomitant decrease in concentration (&#x02212;20%) and activity (&#x02212;30%) of FAK. Myofibrillar fractional rate of protein synthesis, measured on the same biopsy samples, dropped by 50% within 10&#x000a0;days of unloading.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Sarcomere remodeling, in response to unloading in humans, is a very fast process associated with marked changes in cytoskeletal proteins involved in mechanotransduction, leading to a dramatic decrease in protein synthesis. The results also suggest that countermeasures aimed at preventing muscle atrophy should start from the very early phases of the disuse period.</p><p><bold>102</bold></p><p><bold>The transcription factor activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) promotes skeletal myofiber atrophy during fasting</bold></p><p><bold>Manish Suneja, Scott M.

Here, we examined the potential role of ATF4, a transcription factor that plays an evolutionarily ancient role in protein metabolism and the cellular response to starvation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We studied adult male C57BL/6 mice and used electroporation to transfect their tibialis anterior muscles with plasmid DNA.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Reduction of ATF4 expression with an artificial microRNA designed to target ATF4 (miR-ATF4) did not alter myofiber size under nonfasting conditions, but it prevented myofiber atrophy under fasting conditions. Likewise, when we reduced the fasting level of ATF4 mRNA with a phosphorylation-resistant form of eukaryotic intitiation factor 2-alpha, myofiber atrophy was reduced. To determine if increased ATF4 expression was sufficient to reduce myofiber size, we overexpressed ATF4 and found that it reduced myofiber size in the absence of fasting. In contrast, a transcriptionally inactive ATF4 construct did not alter myofiber size, suggesting a requirement for ATF4-mediated transcriptional regulation. To begin to determine the effect of ATF4 on skeletal muscle gene expression, we examined mRNAs encoding atrogin-1, MuRF1, and the protein synthesis inhibitor 4E-BP1, all of which were increased by fasting. Under fasting conditions, miR-ATF4 reduced levels of atrogin-1, MuRF1, and 4E-BP1 mRNAs.

Atrophy of skeletal muscle is a defining and often fatal characteristic of cancer cachexia. Pathological mechanisms of CCS are complex and multi-factorial, which limits the development of an effective means of predicting, preventing, or treating cachexia. To date, research into the disorder was done primarily on various catabolic pathways in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we focus on the dysregulation of glucose utilization in muscle mediated by the impact of aberrant cytokine signaling on components of the insulin responsive pathway together with nuclear receptors. The colon-26 (C26) adenocarcinoma model of cachexia has been established to characterize the morphological and molecular changes which occur during muscle wasting. Molecular analysis revealed altered protein levels of key molecules in the insulin-signaling pathways. Immunohistochemical staining for mouse myosin heavy chain variants also suggests more prominent atrophy in glycolytic type II myofibers in the soleus of cachectic mice. These results suggest that the susceptibility to atrophy in type 2 myofibers may potentially be an adaptive response for alternative cellular energy source due to dysregulated glucose utilization.</p><p><bold>108</bold></p><p><bold>Muscle insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 signaling during the progression of cancer cachexia in the ApcMin/+ mouse</bold></p><p><bold>James P.

Wasting can induce an imbalance between these two important processes and lead to the loss of muscle mass. The induction of muscle protein degradation and mechanisms related to this process are critical mediators of muscle loss in many wasting conditions. The evidence for a regulatory role of muscle protein synthesis and associated signaling that can contribute to muscle wasting is equivocal. The purpose of this study was to determine if IGF-1/mTOR signaling was repressed during the progression of cachexia in ApcMin/+ mice. Male ApcMin/+ mice, an established cachexia model related to intestinal tumors, were sacrificed at peak body weight (12&#x000a0;weeks) and after the onset of cachexia (20&#x000a0;weeks). The gastrocnemius muscles were examined for gene expression and signaling related to protein synthesis. Mice were given an injection of D5Phe 30&#x000a0;min prior to sacrifice to quantify myofibrillar protein synthesis. Cachectic muscle had a 57% reduction in muscle IGF-1 mRNA. mTOR and P70S6 kinase phosphorylation was reduced 53% and 29%, respectively, with the progression of cachexia. The phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 4-BP1 was decreased by 88% by cachexia. During the progression of cachexia, the myofibrillar protein synthesis rate was reduced 46%. In summary, muscle from cachectic ApcMin/+ mice has a reduction in IGF-1 gene expression and associated signaling. This corresponds to a reduction in myofibrillar protein synthesis. Future work needs to examine if the induction of protein synthesis during cachexia can reduce muscle mass loss.</p><p><bold>109</bold></p><p><bold>Macrophages protect against muscle atrophy and promote muscle recovery in vivo and in vitro: a mechanism partly dependent on insulin-like growth factor (IGF) 1 signaling</bold></p><p><bold>Nicolas Dumont, J&#x000e9;r&#x000f4;me Frenette</bold></p><p>R&#x000e9;adaptation, Universit&#x000e9; Laval, Centre de Recherche du CHUQ (CHUL) Quebec, QC, Canada</p><p>Macrophages can play pro- and anti-inflammatory functions during muscle injury and recovery. In the present study, in vivo and in vitro models were used to determine the role of macrophages in muscle atrophy and regrowth. In the in vivo model, contractile properties of soleus muscles were measured in mice depleted in macrophages (etoposide, 15&#x000a0;mg/Kg) and submitted to a hindlimb unloading and reloading protocol. Ambulatory mice were used as control. In the in vitro model, large C2C12 myotubes were incubated for 2&#x000a0;days in low serum medium (DMEM 2% horse serum) and co-cultured with macrophages that contained apoptotic neutrophils (anti-inflammatory macrophage) and/or insulin growth factor-1 antibody (anti-IGF-1, 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L/mL). Myotube diameter was measured in light microscopy, and protein content was quantified with BCA assay. In vivo experiments showed that mice depleted in macrophages had roughly a 30% decrease in maximal muscle force compared to matched placebo mice at 7 and 14&#x000a0;days post-reloading. Alternatively, in vitro experiments showed that the presence of anti-inflammatory macrophages completely prevented the loss of protein content as well as the myotube atrophy after 2&#x000a0;days in low serum medium. Interestingly, the addition of anti-IGF-1 to the co-culture significantly decreased the ability of anti-inflammatory macrophages to protect against the myotube atrophy. These results clearly indicated that macrophages with anti-inflammatory phenotype prevent muscle atrophy while promoting muscle recovery. The protective effect of this macrophage phenotype is partly mediated by the release of IGF-1.</p><p><bold>110</bold></p><p><bold>Smad2 and 3 transcription factors control muscle mass in adulthood</bold></p><p><bold>Roberta Sartori</bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Giulia Milan</bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup><bold>, Maria Patron</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Cristina Mammucari</bold><sup><bold>1,3</bold></sup><bold>, Bert Blaauw</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Reimar Abraham</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Marco Sandri</bold><sup><bold>1,2,3</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padova, Italy; <sup>2</sup>Dulbecco Telethon Institute, Padova, Italy; <sup>3</sup>Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Padova, Padova, Italy</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Loss of muscle mass occurs in a variety of diseases, including cancer, chronic heart failure, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, diabetes, and renal failure, often aggravating pathological progression. Preventing muscle wasting by promoting muscle growth has been proposed as a possible therapeutic approach. Myostatin is an important negative modulator of muscle growth during myogenesis, and myostatin inhibitors are attractive drug targets. However, the role of the myostatin pathway in adulthood and the transcription factors involved in the signaling are unclear.

We have previously shown that FS-induced muscle hypertrophy is associated with increased levels of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-II mRNA, a potent inducer of myogenesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of IGF-II in FS-induced muscle hypertrophy. To test this hypothesis, FS was overexpressed in muscle of IGF-II KO mice. The tibialis anterior (TA) muscles of KO IGF-II as well as wild-type (WT) mice were electroporated with the plasmid pM1-FS288 (left leg) and the control plasmid pM1 (right leg). Seventeen days after electroporation, TA muscles were removed, weighted, and frozen for biochemical analysis or embedded in paraffin for morphological analysis. Our results show that FS overexpression in TA muscle of WT mice caused muscle hypertrophy characterized by increased muscle mass (+36%, 50.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;2.9 vs 37.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.3&#x000a0;mg, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), fiber cross sectional area (CSA; 2.3-fold, 4,081&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;225 vs 1,812&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;114&#x000a0;&#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5), and IGF-II mRNA (2.3-fold, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5). In IGF-II KO mice, FS induced the same degree of muscle hypertrophy. Indeed, muscle mass was increased by 33% (23.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.6 vs 17.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.0, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) and CSA by twofold (3,973&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;387 vs 1,970&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;113, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6).

This study was undertaken to investigate the role of beta 2-adrenoceptors (AR) and cAMP in regulating the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) in skeletal muscle. We report that increased levels of cAMP in isolated muscles, promoted by the cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), were accompanied by decreased activity of the UPS, levels of ubiquitin-protein conjugates, and expression of atrogin-1, a key ubiquitin-protein ligase involved in muscle atrophy. In cultured myotubes, atrogin-1 induction following dexamethasone treatment was completely prevented by IBMX. Furthermore, administration of clenbuterol, a selective beta 2-agonist, to mice increased muscle cAMP levels and suppressed the fasting induced expression of atrogin-1 and MuRF-1, atrogin-1 mRNA being much more responsive to clenbuterol. Moreover, clenbuterol increased the phosphorylation of muscle Akt and Foxo3a in fasted rats. Similar responses were observed in muscles exposed to dibutyryl-cAMP. The stimulatory effect of clenbuterol on cAMP and Akt was abolished in muscles from beta 2-AR knockout (KO) mice. The suppressive effect of beta 2-agonist on atrogin-1 was not mediated by PGC-1-alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha known to be induced by beta 2-agonists and previously shown to inhibit atrogin-1 expression), since food-deprived PGC-1-alpha KO mice were still sensitive to clenbuterol. These findings suggest that the cAMP increase induced by stimulation of beta 2-AR in skeletal muscles from fasted mice is possibly the mechanism by which catecholamines suppress atrogin-1 and the UPS, this effect being mediated via phosphorylation of Akt and thus inactivation of Foxo3.</p><p>Financial support by FAPESP (08/06694-6) and CNPq (305847/06-6 and 300440/05-7).</p><p><bold>114</bold></p><p><bold>Extracellular zinc signaling in the activation of the ubiquiting proteasome pathway</bold></p><p><bold>Pontus M.

PKR activation attenuates protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; and increases protein degradation through the activation of NF-kB by phosphorylating IkB.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Extracellular Zn activates PKR by releasing intracellular Ca stores from the ER. The PKR-mediated pathways lead to both the depression of protein synthesis and increase of protein degradation which together result in muscle wasting (see Figure).

Roberts</bold></p><p>Renal Division, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA</p><p>Muscle atrophy is a consequence of disuse and chronic diseases like cancer and diabetes. It has been proposed that atrophy is a result of coordinated increases in expression of genes encoding various components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system including ubiquitin and the muscle-specific E3 ligases Atrogin-1(AT-1)/MAFbx and MuRF1; however, different signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K/Akt/FOXO, IKK/NF-kB, and MEK/ERK/Sp1) regulate these components. For example, insulin deficiency (i.e., diabetes) accelerates proteolysis and increases AT-1/MuRF1 expression via downregulation of PI3K/Akt and subsequent FOXO activation. In contrast, ubiquitin (UbC) transcription is increased by the MEK/ERK/Sp1 pathway, which is activated acutely by insulin. These seemingly paradoxical observations raise questions about how the transcription of these various genes is coordinated. In this study, we tested whether chronic inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway by glucocorticoids in muscle cells indirectly activates the MEK/ERK pathway. L6 myotubes were treated with dexamethasone (Dex) for up to 48&#x000a0;h. After 24&#x000a0;h, Dex inhibited PI3K/Akt signaling and increased AT-1 mRNA. MEK/ERK/Sp1 signaling and UbC transcription were simultaneously activated. Interestingly, Dex decreased IRS-1 protein while increasing IRS-2 protein. This suggested that downregulation of IRS-1/PI3K/Akt and FOXO activation leads to a reciprocal increase in IRS-2 expression and activation of MEK/ERK/Sp1 signaling. To test this possibility, we knocked down IRS-1 protein using siRNA or expressed constitutively activated FOXO3a in myotubes. IRS-2 protein, MEK/ERK signaling, and UbC expression were increased. We conclude that FOXO3a mediates a reciprocal crosstalk between the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK pathways that coordinately increases both AT-1/MuRF1 and ubiquitin expression, thereby supporting an increased rate of proteolysis.</p><p><bold>116</bold></p><p><bold>Elucidating the role of the ubiquitin E3 ligases and autophagy pathway in human cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Nathan A.

The ubiquitin ligases MuRF1 and MAFBx have been shown to be involved in a number of models of cachexia including cancer. We aim to elucidate the upstream signalling pathways involved in muscle loss in the quadriceps muscle in cachectic and non-cachectic tumour-bearing mice.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Three groups of DBA/Balb-c mice were injected s.c. with C-26 carcinoma cells (cachectic), C-26 carcinoma cells (non-cachectic) and vehicle, respectively. Mice were sacrificed at day&#x000a0;14 at two different time points (2&#x000a0;a.m. and 2&#x000a0;p.m.), and quadriceps muscle and tumour were harvested and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C.

Plasma IL-6 levels were increased 465-fold in cachectic vs control mice and 20-fold in non-cachectic vs control mice. MAFBx and MuRF1 expression was increased 23- and 26-fold in cachectic muscle vs control, respectively, with no significant difference between control and non-cachectic.

Braun, Xinxia Zhu, Aaron J. Grossberg, Daniel L. Marks</bold></p><p>Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Activation of the central melanocortin system by cytokines recapitulates many key features of cachexia. Melanocortin blockade has been shown to prevent the loss of lean mass in experimental cachexia and increase lean mass in healthy animals. We hypothesize that melanocortin activation potentiates the loss of muscle mass in cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The melanocortin agonist MTII and antagonist AgRP were administered via acute injection or chronic infusion through a lateral ventricle cannula. Gene expression was measured using real-time PCR. Analysis of fiber area and fiber composition was performed by immunohistochemical analysis using specific antibodies. Experimental cachexia was induced in rats by either implantation of a syngenic sarcoma or five-sixths nephrectomy.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Acute and chronic administration of MTII results in the upregulation of the E3 ubiquitin ligases MAFbx and MuRF-1 in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, some of this effect is independent of the decrease in food intake associated with melanocortin activation. Melanocortin blockade is associated with the retention of skeletal muscle weight in experimental cachexia.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Melanocortin activation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alterations in food intake in cachexia. Melanocortin signaling also has effects that are independent of food intake, including increasing the mRNA levels of the catabolic mediators MAFbx and MuRF-1 in skeletal muscle. Furthermore, melanocortin blockade can reverse myofibrillar atrophy in experimental cachexia. These findings suggest an important role for the central melanocortin system in the pathogenesis of muscle catabolism in cachexia, and further support the use of melanocortin antagonists in its treatment.</p><p><bold>119</bold></p><p><bold>Increased activities of proteasome and lysosomal cathepsins B and L in skeletal muscle from intensive care patients with sepsis</bold></p><p><bold>Maria Klaude, Maiko Mori, Olav Rooyackers, Jan Wernerman</bold></p><p>Department of Clinical Science, Intervention and Technology, Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, Karolinska University Hospital, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Intensive care patients suffering from sepsis are characterised by muscle wasting due to increased net protein breakdown. Myofibrillar proteins are mainly degraded via the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Lysosomes are implicated in the degradation of extracellular and cytoplasmic constituents and of organelles like mitochondria. Research on muscle-wasting conditions previously focused on the importance of the proteasome pathway. Recent reports have indicated that also the lysosomal pathway is activated in atrophying muscle cells. Thus, we have measured the proteolytic activity of both proteasomes and lysosomes in leg muscle biopsies from sepsis patients with multiple organ failure.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8) admitted with septic shock to the intensive care unit and metabolically healthy controls (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7) undergoing elective surgery were studied. Muscle biopsies were obtained from the vastus lateralis muscle. The biopsies were homogenised; fractions for analyses of proteasome and lysosome proteolytic activities were obtained by differential centrifugation. Proteasome and lysosomal cathepsin B and L activities were determined using fluorogenic peptide substrates.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In the patients, proteasome activity was 44% higher (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) as compared to controls. Also, lysosomal proteolytic activities were higher, cathepsin B by 200% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) and cathepsin L by 150% (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), compared to controls. The activities of both cathepsin B and L correlated significantly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) with the proteasome activity in the patients, but not in the controls.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results give evidence that during catabolic conditions, not only the proteasomal pathway is activated in skeletal muscle but also the lysosomal pathway, possibly even to a greater extent.</p><p><bold>120</bold></p><p><bold>Autophagy-lysosome system and the control of muscle mass</bold></p><p><bold>Eva Masiero</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Cristina Mammucari</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Masaaki Komatzu</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Bert Blaauw</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Marco Sandri</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Venetian Institute of Molecular Medicine, Padova, Italy; <sup>2</sup>Tokyo Metropolitan Institute of Medical Science, Tokyo, Japan</p><p><bold>Background</bold>: The size of skeletal muscle is determined by a balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation. In mammalian cells, half-life of proteins is controlled by two proteolytic systems: the ubiquitin-proteasome and the autophagy-lysosome. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism that allows cell survival during starvation through the bulk degradation of proteins and organelles by lysosomal enzymes. In skeletal muscle, both systems are under FoxO regulation, and their excessive activation induces severe muscle loss. Conversely, altered autophagy has been observed in various myopathies. However, the role of autophagy in skeletal muscle has not been determined by loss-of-function approaches.</p><p><bold>Methods</bold>: Atg7 floxed mice were crossed with transgenic mice expressing cre-recombinase under a muscle specific promoter. Autophagy knockout muscles were characterized by morphological, physiological, biochemical, and molecular approaches and compared to control wild-type muscles.</p><p><bold>Results</bold>: Here, we report that muscle-specific deletion of Atg7 gene resulted in profound muscle atrophy and age-dependent decrease in force. Atg7 null muscles showed accumulation of abnormal mitochondria, sarcoplasmic reticulum distension, disorganization of sarcomere, and formation of aberrant concentric membranous structures. Atg7 null muscle showed an increase of oxidative stress and an activation of unfolded protein response, which contribute to muscle weakness. Importantly, autophagy inhibition exacerbated muscle loss during denervation and fasting.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: In conclusion, autophagy flux is important to preserve muscle mass and to maintain myofiber integrity. Our results suggest that inhibition/alteration of autophagy can contribute to myofiber degeneration and weakness in muscle disorders characterized by accumulation of abnormal mitochondria and inclusions.</p><p><bold>121</bold></p><p><bold>Physical activity level as an outcome measure for use in cancer cachexia trials: a feasibility study</bold></p><p><bold>Mathew Maddocks</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Anthony Byrne</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Colin D.

However, the molecular mechanisms that mediate muscle catabolism are largely unknown, and no specific pharmacological agents are available to antagonize the loss of muscle mass. We therefore analysed two different protein degradation pathways in skeletal muscle biopsies of CHF patients and tested the age-dependent effects of exercise training to prevent muscle wasting.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sixty CHF patients and 60 healthy subjects (HS) were randomized to 4&#x000a0;weeks of bicycle ergometer training at 70% of the heart rate reserve 4&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;20 min/day or to a control group (C). Before and after the intervention, a spiroergometry, echocardiography and a muscle biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle were performed.

(2) Molecular training effects: At baseline, Murf-1 mRNA expression CHF patients were significantly elevated versus HS at 593&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;68 versus 410&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;27&#x000a0;rel. units (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.013) and protein expression at 0.90&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.08 versus 0.62&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.05&#x000a0;rel. units (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018).

Exercise training significantly improves VO<sub>2</sub> max in both younger and older patients with CHF. Both younger and older patients with heart failure derive a similar anticatabolic benefit from training interventions. These data underline the clinical role of exercise-based rehabilitation programs to prevent CHF-related muscle wasting in the elderly.</p><p><bold>123</bold></p><p><bold>Phase II non-randomized study of the efficacy and safety of cyclooxygenase (COX) 2 inhibitor celecoxib on patients with cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Giovanni Mantovani, Antonio Maccio, Clelia Madeddu, Roberto Serpe, Giorgia Antoni, Elena Massa</bold></p><p>Deparment of Medical Oncology, University of Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Chronic inflammation is one of the main features of cancer cachexia.

A significant increase of lean body mass and a significant decrease of TNF-alpha were observed.

It has been suggested that the angiotensin II-receptor antagonist irbesartan can improve insulin sensitivity via selective activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-gamma). We aimed to assess the effect of irbesartan on impaired insulin sensitivity in patients with CHF.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In a prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomized single center study, we included 36 non-diabetic patients with stable ischemic CHF (age, 63&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9&#x000a0;years; BMI, 28.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>; peak VO<sub>2</sub>, 16.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4.8&#x000a0;mL/kg/min, all mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;SD).

The aim of the present study was to confirm usefulness of ports for TPN.</p><p><bold>Method:</bold> In the period 1 January 2008 to 30 September 2009 in PMD, in our department, 175 ports were implanted. Twenty of them were used for TPN. We compared the rate of complications in group I patients receiving chemotherapy and group II receiving TPN through port. The catheter and vascular access patency was controlled by fluoroscopy before TPN was started and maintained by flushing with normal saline after each infusion. Chemotherapy group lines were flushed once a month with heparin and saline.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Several complications were encountered in group I: catheter total occlusion 1.14%, partial occlusion 5%, skin infection 1.71%, leakage 2.28%, skin atrophy 1.14%, and no blood back flow after implantation 0.57%. There was no line complication in TPN group.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Lack of complications in group II can be accidental, but the aim of the study was to prove that TPN does not increase the rate of port-a-caths complications, particularly occlusion of the catheter. Vascular access port is suitable for TPN and can improve the well-being of end-of-live patient. The experience of the medical staff is probably the most important factor in decreasing the total rate of complications.</p><p><bold>132</bold></p><p><bold>Evaluation of visceral lean and fat body mass with CT-scan image analysis in oncological patients with anorexia and cachexia symptoms before and after an anti-cachexia pharmaconutritional treatment</bold></p><p><bold>Roberto Serpe</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Clelia Madeddu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Antonio Maccio</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Marco Mura</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Stefano Marini</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, S&#x000ed;lvia Busquets Rius</bold><sup><bold>3</bold></sup><bold>, Giovanni Mantovani</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Medical Oncology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; <sup>2</sup>Department of Radiology, Azienda Ospedaliero Universitaria di Cagliari, Cagliari, Italy; <sup>3</sup>Cancer Research Group, Departament de Bioqu&#x000ed;mica i Biologia Molecular, Facultat de Biologia, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Body composition evaluation is one of the most important malnutrition indicators, either in physiological or pathological states. Oncological patient with anorexia/cachexia syndrome shows typical symptoms characterized by loss of lean body mass with or without loss of fat mass. Precise assessment of this tissue waste is important to evaluate patient&#x02019;s cachexia characteristics and for the appropriated therapy. CT-scan image analysis technology is an innovative, sensible, and precise new tool in evaluation of body composition, positively described by many authors in different pathologies. The aim of this study is to determine the variations of lean and fat body mass in cachectics oncologic patients treated with anticachexia pharmaconutritional therapy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Twenty-five patients with cancer-related anorexia and cachexia were enrolled. Region L2&#x02013;L3 vertebra abdominal CT was performed at enrollment date and before the start of treatment. The same CT was performed at the end of treatment, after 16&#x000a0;weeks. DICOM radiological images were processed with specific images analysis software Slice-O-Matic (Tomovision, Montreal, QC, Canada) to obtain areas of abdominal tissues.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The results shows a significant increase of muscle mass at L3 vertebra level as well as no significant decrease of mass in the same region in a subset of this patient, confirming the improvement shown in clinical and functional parameters after treatment. The methodology seems to be very good and fit with other data.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> This preliminary study confirms the quality of CT image analyses data in oncological cachectic patients, either for first assessment or for follow-up body composition evaluation.</p><p><bold>133</bold></p><p><bold>Randomised controlled pilot study of neuromuscular electrical stimulation of the quadriceps in patients with non-small cell lung cancer</bold></p><p><bold>Mathew Maddocks</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Mary Lewis</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Alpna Chauhan</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Cathann Manderson</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Joanna Hocknell</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Andrew Wilcock</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Palliative Medicine, University of Nottingham, Nottingham, UK; <sup>2</sup>Palliative Medicine, Derby Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Derby, UK</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Patients with lung cancer experience muscle wasting and weakness.

The treatment scheme included (1) pain control, (2) nutrition support, (3) prokinetics, (4) pro- and prebiotics, (5) correction of anemia, and (6) COX-2 and MOA inhibitors. The pts were divided into two groups according to the duration of complex treatment use: in the first group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12), the treatment was conducted for a period of 14&#x000a0;days before every cycle of CT, whereas in the second group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11), the treatment was additionally resumed on the seventh to eighth day after administration of CT for a period of 20&#x000a0;days.

CC can improve under successful anticancer treatment, as a key pathophysiologic mechanism of CC is catabolic drive caused by the cancer itself. We systematically investigate the evidence for the reversibility of CCS under successful anticancer treatment in advanced (stage III/IV) non-small cell lung cancer.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Systematic literature review of phase-III trials investigating chemo- or chemo-radiotherapies in advanced NSCLC, published 2000&#x02013;2009 in major (oncology) journals (JCO, EJC, Ann Oncol, JAMA, Lancet and NEJM). Data extraction includes presence of weight assessment at baseline and overtime, weight as trial endpoint, extent of weight response associated with anticancer treatment and mentioning of CC assessment.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of 101 trials, 89 met inclusion criteria; mentioning weight assessment, 50 trials; weight in patient characteristics/ stratification parameters, 30; weight as prognostic factor, 15; weight loss mentioned in eligibility criteria, 12; weight (loss) in adverse events tables, 5; composite endpoint clinical benefit including weight, 2; direct monitoring of weight change, 3; improvement of weight under study treatment, none; and mentioning the word cachexia in publication, none.</p><p><bold>Discussion:</bold> This is the first systematic review exploring development of weight associated with anticancer treatment in advanced NSCLC patients. Not one single trial reported weight gain under successful anticancer treatment. Cachexia is commonly an exclusion criteria for study participation and is rather noticed as an adverse factor for successful treatment, but data about weight development were not reported.

Yet, it is a significant cause of both physical and psychosocial morbidity. A 3-year project, funded by Macmillan Cancer Support, was undertaken in order to define strategies to improve the experience of ACS for patients with cancer. This led to the development of a professional resource pack.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Baseline projects addressed the following key aspects of care: (a) professionals&#x02019; awareness and approaches to cachexia, (b) symptom burden for patients with ACS and (c) impact of standardised assessment and management tools on patient symptom scores.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Key findings are as follows: (a) awareness and approach to ACS is highly variable, leading to inconsistent care [2]; (b) symptom burden associated with ACS is significant [3]; and (c) simple interventions can make a significant difference to the experience of ACS [4]. These results led to the development of a set of guidelines on the assessment and management of ACS, the Macmillan Durham cachexia pack (MDCP). This is intended for use by any healthcare professional. The pack includes a short assessment tool, algorithms for management of dietary and exercise needs according to patient&#x02019;s fitness, symptom management advice and a number of patient/carer information sheets addressing the practical and psychological issues they face.</p><p><bold>Conclusions</bold>: There is room for significant improvement in the experience of ACS, but simple measures make a difference.

As one of the commonly encountered features of cancer cachexia is reduced physical functioning, there is a need to identify and define the spectrum of impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions experienced by individuals with cancer cachexia. Such an exercise would be an important step in cataloguing the range of functional impairments and would help direct use of appropriate measurement tools and thus help assess the functional impact of anticachexia treatment programs. The International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) was developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to provide a common language to describe health-related states. The ICF adopts a bi-directional bio-psychosocial framework representing an integrated model of human functioning.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The objective of this study is to establish standardized functional status indicators (FSIs) that represent all components of human functioning and environmental factors in individuals with cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A literature review followed by a Delphi process involving known experts in the field will establish an international consensus on indicators of all functional limitations in patients with cancer cachexia.

We monitored directly spontaneous physical activity (PA) in <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;53 patients with upper GI cancer to verify associations between quality of life scores in (1) the symptom-focused anorexia/cachexia subscale (ACS) of the Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Treatment Questionnaire (FAACT) and (2) the broader quality of life score represented by the Trial Outcome Index (TOI, association of the ACS plus physical wellbeing (PWB) and functional wellbeing (FWB) scores) of the same questionnaire.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Physical activity, including daily time sitting/lying, standing, walking, number of steps taken, and step cadence, was monitored using an accelerometry-based system (ActivPAL&#x02122;, UK). Anorexia/cachexia severity was assessed by the application of the FAACT questionnaire.

There is evidence of associations between reported weight loss, performance status, and symptoms at a single time point, but our experience suggests that the inter-relationships between these variables are complex and may alter over short time scales. In this study, we investigated the relationships between changes in weight, patient-reported performance status, quality of life and strength between consecutive clinic visits.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> A retrospective study was conducted using the CNRP database. Weight, self-assessed performance status (PS-pt) taken from box&#x000a0;4 of the patient-generated subjective global assessment, and patient-rated strength and QoL from the Edmonton symptom assessment scale were recorded at first and second visits.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Three hundred twenty-three patients (male/female, 169/154; mean age, 64.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;12.0) were included.

The purpose of this study was to determine if CRF is associated with measures of muscle mass and strength in advanced cancer patients (ACP).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighty-four patients (48 men, 36 women, aged 61.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13.2&#x000a0;years) newly diagnosed (&#x02264;6&#x000a0;months) with inoperable (stages III&#x02013;IV) gastrointestinal or non-small cell lung cancer participated in this study. All patients completed the brief fatigue inventory (BFI). Handgrip (HGS) and quadriceps (QS) strength was assessed using isometric and isokinetic dynamometry, respectively. Skeletal muscle mass index (SMMI) was calculated from the appendicular lean mass measured via dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry divided by body height squared.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> When compared to women, men had significantly greater amounts of total lean body mass, as well as arm and leg mass. Furthermore, men displayed greater handgrip and quadriceps strength.

We investigated serum leptin levels and leptin gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) of cancer patients and explored its crosstalk with adipokine zinc-&#x003b1;2-glycoprotein (ZAG), a potential cachexia mediator.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Thirty-nine patients with oesophageal (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8), gastric (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;16), or pancreatic (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) cancer, with (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;24) or without (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;15) cachexia (weight loss &#x02265;5%), were recruited.

Its manifestations commonly include anorexia, growth failure in children, inflammation, insulin resistance, and hypogonadism. We have formulated a novel hypothesis addressing the links between these seemingly unrelated syndromes.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We identified a possible common unifying factor behind some of cachexia&#x02019;s clinical manifestations based on mechanistic studies in murine myotubes, effects of the Zn chelating compound <sc>d</sc>-myo-inositol 1,2,6-triphosphate (alpha trinositol) in the cachexia inducing MAC-16 model, and pre-clinical and clinical data on cachexia and Zn deficiency.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Zn is a critical trace element in physiology. It has been recognized that many tumors draw Zn, and systemic Zn levels often decline in cancer. However, it has not been recognized that in cachexia, skeletal muscle tissue, that constitutes a large portion of total BM (~40% in humans), also significantly and progressively accumulates Zn. Extracellular Zn activates PKR-mediated pathways leading to muscle wasting by mobilizing intracellular Ca. The continuous redistribution of Zn restricts its availability for critical physiological functions. A large body of research demonstrates that Zn depletion and/or deficiency frequently and predictably results in anorexia, growth failure in children, increased inflammation, insulin resistance, and hypogonadism.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In cancer cachexia, Zn is continuously diverted from its normal physiological functions. The clinical manifestations of Zn deficiency are strikingly similar to the symptoms characterizing cancer cachexia. Several conditions are known to cause systemic Zn depletion and deficiency. We suggest that cancer cachexia is one of them (see Figure).

Elevated plasma levels of zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG) are associated with several types of cancer and may affect lipolysis. ZAG is expressed and secreted by adipocytes, and its expression in adipose tissue is elevated in mice with cancer cachexia. However, the clinical relevance of these findings for loss of adipose tissue mass in patients with pancreatic cancer prior to clinical manifestations of advanced cachexia remains to be established.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Biopsies of omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue were sampled from non-cachectic pancreatic cancer patients undergoing tumor resection (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;22) and control patients without cancer (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;11). mRNA expression levels of ZAG and other genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR relative to GAPDH. Alterations in subcutaneous and omental adipose tissue mass were monitored by volumetric CT analysis (9&#x000a0;cm from L4/L5 in cranial direction) at inclusion and during follow-up.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Pancreatic cancer patients displayed 3.1- and 1.7-fold higher median levels of ZAG mRNA in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue, respectively, as compared to controls (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). Investigations at the mRNA level of 27 other genes involved in fatty acid and triacylglyceride metabolism revealed that 17 were enhanced in omental adipose tissue, whereas three were upregulated in subcutaneous adipose tissue. Preliminary volumetric results comparing adipose tissue mass before surgery and at follow-up suggest that omental adipose tissue is selectively lost as compared to subcutaneous adipose tissue.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data suggest that ZAG mRNA expression is increased in both omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue in pancreatic cancer patients without clinical symptoms of advanced cachexia. Altered expression levels of genes involved in lipid metabolism might be predictive of selective loss of omental adipose tissue mass in the early stages of cachectic development.</p><p><bold>148</bold></p><p><bold>Anorexia, energy expenditure, and heart rate variability (HRV) in cancer patients: a pilot study</bold></p><p><bold>Alessio Molfino, Alessandro Laviano, Maurizio Muscaritoli, Irma Kushta, Filippo Rossi Fanelli</bold></p><p>Department of Clinical Medicine, Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> The hypothalamus is involved in the control of food intake and energy expenditure via the autonomous nervous system.

While often described as a static structure, the sarcomere is actually dynamic and undergoes constant turnover, allowing it to adapt to physiological changes while still maintaining function.</p><p><bold>Objective:</bold> We evaluated the role of miR199a-5p (miR199) for the sarcomere disorganization in tumor rats with cardiac atrophy.</p><p><bold>Methods and results:</bold> Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed robust expression of miR199 in normal adult rat hearts, while its expression was markedly lower (&#x02212;40%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in tumor-bearing rats with cardiac atrophy. Immunoblotting revealed a marked reduction in cardiac myosin heavy chain protein (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-MHC) in hearts from tumor-bearing rats compared to normal rats, while cardiac troponin T and tropomyosin were not affected. Cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocyte (NRCM) express high levels of miR-199. Lipofectamin-based transfection of anti-miR199 in NRCM reduced miR199 levels by 50- to 100-fold, which was associated with growth retention of cells. Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry revealed enhanced ubiquitination and degradation of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-MHC and Titin, but not of Troponin T and Tropomyosin in anti-miR199-treated NRCM. Furthermore, electron microscopy revealed disappearance of the Z-disc in anti-miR199-treated NRCM. Three ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes, Ube2i, Ube2g1, and Ube2o, emerged as direct targets of miR-199a in NRCM, which was confirmed by immunoblotting and with a reporter plasmids (psiCheck) containing the potential miRNA binding sites of Ube2i, Ube2g1, and Ube2o at the 3&#x02032;-position of the luciferase reporter gene. In turn, overexpression of miR199 by pre-miR199 transfection prevented MHC degradation and significantly reduced protein levels of Ube2i (&#x02212;74%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 vs control pre-miR), Ube2g1 (&#x02212;69%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 vs control pre-miR), and Ube2o (&#x02212;55%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01 vs control pre-miR). Similarly, transfection of cardiomyocytes with siRNA directed against Ube2i, Ube2g1, or Ube2o prevented MHC degradation, an effect that was not observed with control siRNA or siRNA directed against Ube2j, a ubiquitin conjugating enzyme that is not a target of miR-199. Furthermore, HIF1-alpha, a pro-angiogenic protein mainly regulated by the UPS, was not affected by modulations of miR199 and or Ube2i, Ube2g1, and Ube2o expression.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our observations suggest a key role of miR199 for the homeostasis of sarcomeric protein turnover in postnatal cardiomyocytes and adult hearts. Reduction of miR199 as we report here in tumor-bearing rats promotes cardiac cachexia by increasing UPS-mediated degradation of sarcomeric proteins, i.e., MHC and Titin. miR199 targets hereby a specific subset of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes, i.e., Ube2i, Ube2g1, and Ube2o that seem to be responsible for degrading specific sarcomeric proteins, i.e., MHC and Titin.</p><p><bold>151</bold></p><p><bold>Severe progressive heart failure in experimental cancer cachexia only transiently elevates B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)</bold></p><p><bold>Jochen Springer</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Anika Tschirner</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Sandra Palus</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Aleksandra Grzesiak</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Elena Kaschina</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Josep M.

Pullen, Jennifer L. Lachey, Ravi Kumar, Kathryn Underwood, R. Scott Pearsall, Jas Seehra</bold></p><p>Acceleron Pharma, Cambridge, MA, USA</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cachexia is characterized by undesired weight loss resulting from loss of both muscle and adipose tissue. Myostatin, a known negative regulator of muscle mass, is upregulated in the colon-26 rodent model of cachexia. Myostatin and other negative muscle mass regulators signal via the activin receptor type IIB (ActRIIB), and treatment of normal mice with a non-signaling, decoy ActRIIB results in a robust increase in lean tissue. This study evaluates the potential beneficial effects of ACE-435, a fusion protein comprised of an optimized extracellular domain of ActRIIB linked to a human Fc, in cachectic mice.</p><p><bold>Materials and methods:</bold> Eight-week-old BALB/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;106 colon-26 adenocarcinoma cells. Two weeks post-implantation, mice were randomly assigned to receive vehicle or 10&#x000a0;mg/kg ACE-435 two times a week. Body weight and in vivo body composition were tracked throughout the study.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> ACE-435 treatment resulted in a significant body weight increase that was maintained across the study (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Seven weeks post-tumor implantation vehicle-treated mice had a 7% loss of baseline lean mass, whereas the ACE-435 group had a 27% increase in baseline lean mass (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). Importantly, fat mass was not different between groups, illustrating that the ACE-435 anabolic effect did not exacerbate fat loss. Also, although not reaching significance (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.076), the ACE-435 group had an 8-day mean increase in survival.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data demonstrate that ACE-435 has beneficial effects in alleviating cachexia in tumor-bearing mice. Thus, a soluble ActIIB-Fc fusion protein could be an effective therapy for treating cancer-induced cachexia.</p><p><bold>153</bold></p><p><bold>STAT3 in skeletal muscle links the acute phase response and muscle wasting in colon-26 cancer cachexia</bold></p><p><bold>Tufan Aydogdu</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Leonidas G.

We hypothesized these observations are mechanistically linked through IL-6/STAT3 actions in skeletal muscle.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Quadriceps gene expression from mice with colon-26 cachexia, known to be mediated largely by IL-6, was profiled using Illumina BeadChips. GeneSpring was used for data normalization, statistical analysis, and hierarchical clustering. Metacore and NextBio were used for gene and pathway analyses. Selected profiles were validated by qPCR and Western blotting.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Gene expression profiles in early and late cachexia were significantly correlated. The top canonical pathways upregulated in both were inflammation/IL-6/STAT3 signaling, proteolysis, and MAPK signaling. The top downregulated pathways were the PGC1A pathway, calcium regulation/signaling, ECM, focal adhesion, skeletal myogenesis, and insulin signaling. Increased pSTAT3 was observed in cachexia both in liver and skeletal muscle. STAT3 target genes, including SOCS3, fibrinogen, serum amyloid A, lipid binding protein, and haptoglobin were coordinately induced in both tissues. By Western blotting, fibrinogen was induced 80-fold over normal in quadriceps and tenfold in liver. Quantitation of muscle versus liver fibrinogen demonstrated that up to 40% of serum fibrinogen could be muscle derived.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathway is highly induced in liver and skeletal muscle in colon-26 cachexia. APR genes were highly expressed not only in liver but also in skeletal muscle. These results indicate that skeletal muscle contributes to the APR in cancer and that STAT3 activation in muscle provides a mechanistic link between muscle wasting and the APR.</p><p><bold>154</bold></p><p><bold>Male hypogonadism in advanced cancer patients: nutritional, functional, and quality of life correlates</bold></p><p><bold>Antonio A.

Our aim was to explore the relationships between low free testosterone (LFT) and nutritional, functional, and quality of life (QOL) characteristics in ACP.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Free testosterone levels were measured in 100 males (median age, 64&#x000a0;years) newly diagnosed with advanced non-small cell lung (38.8%) and gastrointestinal (61.2%) cancers. The Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS), brief fatigue inventory (BFI), patient-generated subjective global assessment (PG-SGA), McGill quality of life questionnaire (MQOL), handgrip strength test (Jamar&#x000ae;), DXA for body composition, albumin, CRP, and WBC were evaluated. Multiple regression analyses (controlling for age, diagnosis (lung/GI), treatment (radio/chemo), survival, and concurrent medications) were performed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Seventy-six patients (76%) presented with LFT (&#x0003c;31.1&#x000a0;pmol/L). As compared to eugonadic patients, patients with LFT had similar QOL, weakness, dyspnea, and appetite according to the ESAS and similar CRP and WBC levels, worse performance status by PG-SGA Box&#x000a0;4 (beta, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.07, 1.11), worse BFI total score (16.68; 2.03, 31.32), worse MQOL physical score (&#x02212;2.20; &#x02212;4.01, &#x02212;0.39) and total score (&#x02212;1.42; &#x02212;2.54, &#x02212;0.30), lower handgrip strength (&#x02212;11.67&#x000a0;lbs; &#x02212;20.39, &#x02212;2.95) and percentile (&#x02212;11.23; &#x02212;20.56, &#x02212;1.89), lower lean mass for the upper limbs (&#x02212;0.76&#x000a0;kg; &#x02212;1.44, &#x02212;0.09), and lower albumin (&#x02212;3.77; &#x02212;7.21, &#x02212;0.77).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our data show relationships between male hypogonadism and worse nutritional, functional, and QOL characteristics in ACP.

Kilgour, Prosanto Chaudhury, Laura Hornby, Antonio A. L. Vigano</bold></p><p>McGill Nutrition and Performance Laboratory, McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Hypogonadism has been associated with a host of secondary symptoms including diminished energy, poor concentration, depression, and decreased physical performance. These symptoms are often present in advanced cancer patients (ACP), and hypogonadism is a key pathophysiologic mechanism for both sarcopenia and cancer cachexia (CC). To our knowledge, no study has yet systematically reviewed available literature on clinical correlates of hypogonadism in ACP. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative systematic review of the literature regarding the impact of hypogonadism on functional and nutritional status, body composition, symptoms, and quality of life in ACP.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Through a systematic search of both Pubmed and EMBASE databases, six original articles were selected, and their results were tabulated for comparative qualitative analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> No definitive associations between nutritional, functional, or QOL characteristics and hypogonadism were found in the reviewed studies. Possible associations between hypogonadism and weight loss, low albumin, body cell mass, peripheral fat, and muscle mass, inflammation, pain, and opioid consumption, as well as worse emotional and functional well-being, must be confirmed by better-designed studies.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Clear epidemiological data is not yet available to indicate whether hypogonadism is independently correlated with clinical and biological sequaela of CC. Future studies examining hypogonadism in ACP should (a) use standardized kits with sufficient sensitivity and precision in the lower ranges for either free or bio-available testosterone, (b) use multivariate models on adequately sized samples to identify independent clinical correlates of hypogonadism; and (c) include measurements of luteinizing hormone to differentiate primary from secondary hypogonadism.</p><p><bold>156</bold></p><p><bold>Metabolic, nutritional, and inflammatory characteristics in elderly women with newly diagnosed advanced cancer</bold></p><p><bold>Barbara Trutschnigg, Robert D.

No differences in body composition were observed.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our preliminary data suggest that elderly women with newly diagnosed advanced cancer have a greater reliance on fat metabolism at rest and walk shorter distances at lower heart rates and levels of oxygen consumption. These metabolic differences, coupled with the elevation in inflammatory markers and reduction in caloric intake, may signal an early anorectic-cachectic condition, which may have important diagnostic, treatment, and prognostic implications.</p><p><bold>157</bold></p><p><bold>Association between hypogonadism, C-reactive protein, symptom burden, and survival in male cancer patients with cachexia: a preliminary report</bold></p><p><bold>Egidio Del Fabbro, David Hui, Rony Dev, Shalini Dalal, Gina Freer, Eduardo Bruera</bold></p><p>MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> In patients without cancer, hypogonadism is associated with lower lean body mass, increased symptom burden, and decreased survival.

Symptoms were evaluated by the Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS) and bioimpedance by Tanita body composition scale.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> All male patients reported weight loss of &#x0003e;5% within the preceding 6&#x000a0;months; median age, 60; CRP, 20&#x000a0;mg/L; and median testosterone, 185&#x000a0;ng/dL (6.42&#x000a0;nmol/L). The degree of weight loss over the preceding 3&#x000a0;months correlated with CRP levels (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.42, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), but not with testosterone.

Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) is an easy-to-use, non-invasive and reproducible technique to evaluate changes in body composition and nutritional status. Phase angle, derived from by BIA, has been described as a prognostic tool in several chronic diseases and in cancer patients. Thirteen patients (58.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;7.5&#x000a0;years, 58.0&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.6&#x000a0;kg and BMI 20.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.5&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) with advanced cancer have been consecutively referred to the Clinical Nutrition Unit of Federico II University, in Naples. Primary cancer localization was gastric in five, colorectal in three, esophageal in two, pancreatic in two, and pulmonary in one. Anthropometric (weight, height, body mass index and skinfolds) and haematobiochemical (albumin, cholesterol, lymphocytes, haemoglobin and cholinesterase) parameters have been measured. BIA (STA/BIA, Akern) was performed in all patients, and phase angle (expressed in degrees) calculated. The Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method was used to calculate survival and Cox model to evaluate the prognostic effect of phase angle independent of other clinical and nutritional variables. Phase angle resulted strictly related (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.384, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.024) with survival time, slightly (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.055) related with lymphocyte count, but not related with the other anthropometric and biochemical parameters evaluated. This preliminary study confirms phase angle as a prognostic indicator in patients with advanced cancer.

Several factors are considered to be putative mediators of cancer anorexia, including interleukin 1 and 6 (IL-1, IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Recently, hypothalamic mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling has been considered a cellular fuel sensor for regulation of food intake. The aim of this study was to examine the role of hypothalamic mTOR in the control of food intake model of cancer-induced anorexia in rodents.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Walker-256 tumor and Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells were implanted in rat and mouse, respectively. Intrahypothalamic infusion of rapamycin was performed in tumor-bearing (TB) rats during 4&#x000a0;days before analysis, whereas recombinant IL-1-beta and TNF-alpha were acutely infused into the third ventricle of control rats. Food intake analysis, dissection of hypothalamic regions, and Western blotting were combined to evaluate the hypothalamic mTOR activity.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Here, we show that neuronal mTOR pathway is activated in anorexic TB rat and mouse model. As expected, we found high levels of TNF and IL1 in the hypothalamus of TB rat group. Interestingly, intrahypothalamic infusion of recombinant IL-1 or TNF increases mTOR activity and evokes anorexia in control rats. Moreover, central infusion of specific inhibitor of mTOR rapamycin partially blunts the anorectic effect in TB rats. We also observed that the mTOR expression was most intense in the arcuate nucleus, DMH/VMH and PVN when compared to LH in control rats.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Taken together, our data demonstrated that hypothalamic mTOR activity is critical to decreases food intake in tumor-bearing (TB) rodent models.</p><p><bold>167</bold></p><p><bold>The role of the 5-Ht2c receptor in tumor-induced anorexia and gastrointestinal motility in rats</bold></p><p><bold>Haruka Amitani</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Akihiro Asakawa</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Marie Sameshima</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Mizuki Hayashi</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Naoki Fujitsuka</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Akio Inui</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Kagoshima University Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Kagoshima, Japan; <sup>2</sup>TSUMURA Research Laboratories, Ibaraki, Japan</p><p><bold>Background and aims:</bold> Cancer cachexia is a debilitating and life-threatening syndrome characterized by anorexia and loss of fat and skeletal muscle. It is a major source of increasing the morbidity and mortality of cancer patients. We examined the role of the serotonergic system in the food intake, gastrointestinal (GI) motility, and appetite-regulating neuropeptide gene expression in tumor-bearing rats.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Tumor-bearing rats received an intraperitoneal inoculum of 108 AH-130 Yoshida ascites hepatoma cells. GI motility was measured in conscious, freely moving rats by a strain gauge force transducer method. Plasma acyl ghrelin levels were determined by EIA. Appetite-regulating neuropeptide gene expressions in the hypothalamus were quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Effects of acyl ghelin and 5-HT2c receptor antagonist (SB242084) on food intake and GI motility in tumor-bearing rats were examined.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Anorexia was induced after day&#x000a0;5 following tumor implantation. At day&#x000a0;7, food intake, body weight, fat, and skeletal muscle were significantly reduced in tumor-bearing rats, while plasma cytokine (IL-1-beta, IL-10, and IFN-gamma) levels were elevated. Plasma acyl ghrelin concentration was significantly higher in tumor-bearing rats than normal rats in freely fed state; however, acyl ghrelin was lower in 24-h food-deprived state. Neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related peptide (AgRP) mRNA expression in the hypothalamus were upregulated in freely fed tumor-bearing rats. The fasted motor patterns in both the antrum and duodenum were disrupted and replaced by the fed-like pattern in tumor-bearing rats. Acyl ghelin (3&#x000a0;nmol) significantly increased the motor activity in the antrum of tumor-bearing rats, however failed to improve the phase III-like contractions of fasted motility and food intake. 5-HT2c receptor antagonist induced the fasted motor patterns and markedly reversed the decreased food intake in tumor-bearing rats. In addition, hypothalamic NPY mRNA expression was significantly increased by 5-HT2c receptor antagonist.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The present study demonstrated that 5-HT2c receptor plays an important role in tumor-induced anorexia and relieving gastrointestinal motility, and it may be a potential target for the treatment of cancer cachexia.</p><p><bold>168</bold></p><p><bold>Methotrexate-induced anorexia is not associated with the systemic inflammatory response but with a decrease in serum levels of alpha-MSH autoantibodies</bold></p><p><bold>Maria Hamze Sinno, Quentin Coquerel, Mutsumi Terashi, Mo&#x000ef;se Co&#x000eb;ffier, Pierre D&#x000e9;chelotte, Serguei O.

In this work, we studied if MTX-induced anorexia can be related to a systemic increase in interleukin 1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) or to altered production of autoantibodies (autoAbs) against &#x003b1;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (&#x003b1;-MSH).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Sprague&#x02013;Dawley rats received MTX (2.5&#x000a0;mg/kg s.c. for 3&#x000a0;days, D1&#x02013;D3), while pair-fed (PF) and ad libitum-fed control rats received saline. PF rats were allowed ad libitum food intake from D9. Blood samples were taken at D1, D5, D19, and D33. Food intake and body weigh were monitored daily.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In MTX rats, D5 was characterized by maximal suppression of food intake and body weight as well as by intestinal inflammation. PF rats showed identical with MTX group body weight loss till D9. Serum levels of IL-1&#x003b2; were not different among the groups at D1, but at D5, both MTX and PF groups showed a decrease in IL-1&#x003b2; vs. controls, which can be attributed to food restriction. At D19, levels of IL-1&#x003b2; recovered in both MTX and PF rats. At D5, levels of both total and free &#x003b1;-MSH IgG and IgM autoAbs were decreased in MTX but increased in PF rats. In contrast, at D19 levels of &#x003b1;-MSH, autoAbs were higher in MTX than in PF or control rats.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data do not support involvement of systemic proinflammatory factors but suggest that a decrease of autoAbs against &#x003b1;-MSH, an anorexigenic hormone, can play a role in MTX-induced anorexia.</p><p><bold>169</bold></p><p><bold>Changes of affinity of autoantibodies against alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone are involved in the mechanisms of anorexia nervosa and bulimia</bold></p><p><bold>Quentin Coquerel</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Maria Hamze Sinno</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Jean Claude Do Rego</bold><sup><bold>2</bold></sup><bold>, Helgi B.

In this work, we studied if patients with anorexia and bulimia may display autoAbs with different affinity for &#x003b1;-MSH resulting in their opposite role to modulate &#x003b1;-MSH signaling.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Total IgG and IgM were isolated from sera of patients with anorexia nervosa restrictive type, bulimia, or healthy controls. Affinity of IgG and IgM autoAbs for &#x003b1;-MSH was measured using BIAcore, and the epitope responsible for IgG binding to &#x003b1;-MSH was determined. Effect of IgG autoAbs on binding of &#x003b1;-MSH-I125 to melanocortin MC4 receptors was studied in transfected cos-7 cells. The effect of &#x003b1;-MSH autoAbs on feeding and anxiety was studied in a rat model of passive transfer of affinity purified IgG &#x003b1;-MSH autoAbs from patients with anorexia or bulimia into the hypothalamus of rats.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> An increased affinity of IgG autoAbs for &#x003b1;-MSH was found in subjects with bulimia, while affinity of IgM autoAbs was lower in both anorexia nervosa and bulimia. AutoAbs of higher but not of lower affinity was able to block &#x003b1;-MSH-I125 binding on MC4 receptors. Central injections of high or low affinity &#x003b1;-MSH autoAbs in rats resulted in increased and decreased food intake and body weight, respectively, and increased anxiety in both groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results provide the strong evidence that pathological changes in affinity of &#x003b1;-MSH autoAbs are involved in biological mechanisms of anorexia nervosa and bulimia.</p><p><bold>170</bold></p><p><bold>Leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) inhibits food intake by directly activating proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons</bold></p><p><bold>Aaron J. Grossberg, Jarrad M. Scarlett, Xinxia Zhu, Darren D. Bowe, Ayesha K. Batra, Daniel L. Marks</bold></p><p>Department of Pediatrics, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, OR, USA</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cachexia is linked to an increase in circulating inflammatory cytokines, including leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Central LIF administration recapitulates the cardinal features of cachexia, which closely resemble central melanocortin activation. We hypothesized that LIF inhibits feeding by directly activating proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> LIF was administered by bolus injection or chronic infusion through a lateral ventricle cannula to evaluate effects on food intake. Expression of LIF-R and activation of POMC neurons were evaluated using in situ hybridization and IHC. We measured LIF-induced alpha-MSH release from hypothalami by radioimmunoassay. Mice null for gp130, the signal transducing subunit of the LIF-R complex, in POMC neurons (PomcCre-gp130flox) were generated to confirm that LIF directly activates POMC neurons, and that this activation mediates LIF-induced anorexia.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> LIF-R is expressed by 20% of ARC POMC neurons, and LIF significantly increased cFos in POMC neurons compared to vehicle. LIF administration maintained a significant decrease in food intake over 3.5&#x000a0;days. Though control animals reduced food intake post-injection, PomcCre-gp130flox mice were resistant to LIF-induced anorexia. LIF increased MSH release ex vivo compared to a CSF in control hypothalami, but not PomcCre-gp130flox hypothalami.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> LIF acts centrally to inhibit food intake by directly activating POMC neurons, thereby increasing melanocortin tone. This effect requires expression of functional LIF-R/gp130 complex in POMC neurons. Further, LIF induces anorexia without evidence of tachyphylaxis, closely resembling the clinical syndrome of cachexia. This research implicates the role of LIF in cachexia and supports the utility of melanocortin antagonism in its treatment.</p><p><bold>171</bold></p><p><bold>Key phosphatase in cancer-induced anorexia</bold></p><p><bold>Eduardo R.

Furthermore, we found that classical pro-inflammatory mediators are able to suppress the neuronal PTP1B expression. Acute i.c.v. infusion of recombinant IL-1-beta (5&#x000a0;ng) or TNF-alpha (10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>&#x000a0;M) reduced hypothalamic PTP1B expression&#x000a0;45% and 40%, respectively, in control rats (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5).

While in anorexia nervosa (AN) works, a physiological adaptive response defined &#x0201c;simple starvation&#x0201d; in cancer patients acts an inflammatory cascade inducing a metabolic stress (&#x0201c;stress starvation&#x0201d;): amino acids from the protein stores and fatty acids from the adipose tissue are converted into energy to satisfy the metabolic needs. Energy requirements not only depend on the aggressiveness of the disease and level of inactivity it causes but also on the treatment and the presence of prior malnutrition. Resting metabolic rate (RMR) has been measured in 16 young women with restrictive AN, 12 patients with cancer cachexia (CC), and 15 healthy subjects. RMR resulted not significantly different between healthy controls and CC (2,415&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1,227 vs 2,475&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1,987&#x000a0;kcal/die) patients, but significantly lower in restrictive AN (1,345&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;726&#x000a0;kcal/die; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001).

It is not known if this relationship also exists in other species. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of body condition and body weight changes in cats with spontaneously occurring heart failure due to cardiomyopathy.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> All cats with congestive heart failure secondary to cardiomyopathies (e.g., hypertrophic (HCM), dilated (DCM), restrictive, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular (ARVC)) were eligible for the study. Medical records were reviewed, and data regarding initial body weight and body condition, subsequent changes in body weight, and treatment were collected.

Simultaneously, we assessed body composition with DEXA scan, recorded the visual analogue scale (VSA) for appetite assessment, and measured energy and protein intake and output in ten hemodialysis (HD) patients and eight controls (C).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Endocrine assessment showed elevated plasma leptin, PYY, NPY, and reduced acylated ghrelin in HD patients. MSH and GLP-1 were not different from the controls. Fasting suppressed leptin and PYY in both groups; post-prandial rise of PYY and GLP-1 was prominent, and pre-prandial rise of ghrelin was less in HD patients. Kinetics showed that the elevation of leptin and PYY was due to increased secretion and not impaired degradation. Energy intake, expenditure, protein intake, output, and balance were similar in the two groups. The VAS and body fat and lean mass distribution were not different between the C and the HD groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> In contrast to prevailing view, we found that well-dialyzed HD patients, in the absence of any concomitant illness, were neither anorexic nor catabolic. The endocrine finding of elevated PYY, leptin, and suppressed ghrelin is, however, consistent with an anorexigenic profile.

Weight loss can be considered as a disturbance of energy balance, but little is known about the importance of symptoms for changes in energy intake (EI). Study objectives were to prospectively assess EI, weight, and symptoms during the disease course and investigate associations between symptoms and EI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> From 2006 to 2008, 39 patients (females, 18/males, 21) with advanced PC were included and monitored every fourth week until death. EI was measured by the 24-h recall method. The Edmonton symptom assessment scale (ESAS) was used to assess symptoms.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The patients had a median age of 62&#x000a0;years (48, 88), median ECOG status 1, and median survival of 5&#x000a0;months. Seventeen patients (44%) had locally unresectable cancer, 16 (41%) metastatic, and six (15%) recurrent disease. Upon inclusion, 28 (72%) patients reported weight loss &#x02265;10%, and the median daily EI was 7.1&#x000a0;MJ (1.3, 14.8). Negative correlations (Spearman&#x02019;s rho, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) were found between EI and pain (&#x02212;0.44), fatigue (&#x02212;0.47), dry mouth (&#x02212;0.37), depression (&#x02212;0.35), and wellbeing (&#x02212;0.41), but not between EI and appetite loss (&#x02212;0.28, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;0.05). After 1&#x000a0;month (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;28), median daily EI was 7.6&#x000a0;MJ (0.3, 16.2), and general wellbeing was the only symptom significantly associated with EI (&#x02212;0.44, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Several symptoms seem to contribute to reduce EI at inclusion.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of the nutritional status on the clinical outcome of patients with primary or recurrent ovarian cancer with respect to their age, as age and tumour-free surgery are independent prognostic parameters for overall survival.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> In a 2-year-period (January 2007 to December 2008), 152 consecutive patients were analysed. Seventy-nine (52%) of them had primary and 73 (48%) recurrent disease. At the time of admission for surgical therapy, the body composition was analysed with bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) using phase angle alpha and ratio of extra-cellular mass and body cell mass (ECM/BCM). Serum protein parameters were registered. The risk of malnutrition was estimated by nutritional risk score (NRS) and nutritional risk index (NRI). Nutritional risk was defined as NRS &#x02265;3 or NRI &#x02264;100. During operation, a standardised and validated tumour documentation tool (IMO) was performed. Clinical outcome parameters such as length of hospital stay or postoperative complications were documented with regard to the age (&#x0003c;/&#x0003e;65&#x000a0;years).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The median age of patients was 56&#x000a0;years (range, 48&#x02013;66), with median BMI, 24.4&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 21.8&#x02013;27.3). Almost one third were older than 65&#x000a0;years (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;43/29%). The &#x02265;65-year group had a significant higher rate of nutritional risk classified by NRS (14/43 vs. 16/109, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) and NRI (99.6 vs. 105.7, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), whereas the BMI (25.4 vs. 24.1, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) was significantly increased. These patients (&#x02265;65&#x000a0;years) had significantly higher BIA-ECM/BCM ratio (1.3 vs. 1.1, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), they needed significantly more often blood transfusions during or after surgery (3 vs. 0.5, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), the length of stay was significantly higher (18 vs. 14&#x000a0;days, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005) and the phase angle &#x003b1; was significantly lower (4.5&#x000b0; vs. 5.2&#x000b0;, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) as well as serum albumin (4.0 vs. 4.3, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.005). There were no differences in weight loss, food intake, post-operative complications and complete resection rate between the &#x02265;65 and &#x0003c;65 group.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Elderly patients with ovarian cancer have an increased risk of malnutrition before oncologic surgery, evaluated by NRS, NRI and BIA, phase angle &#x003b1; and ECM/BCM ratio, although operative and postoperative complications are not increased. Elderly patients with nutritional risk factors should be identified for an individualised nutritive care before surgery and may thereby have an improved outcome.</p><p><bold>181</bold></p><p><bold>Advanced cancer patients and home parenteral nutrition</bold></p><p><bold>Lidia Santarpia</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Ilenia Grandone</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Maria Carmen Pagano</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Fabrizio Pasanisi</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Franco Contaldo</bold><sup>1</sup><bold>, Federico Bozzetti</bold><sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, Federico II University, Naples, Italy; <sup>2</sup>Department of Surgery, Hospital of Prato, Prato, Italy</p><p>Under-nutrition and cachexia occur frequently in cancer patients and are, per se, responsible for excess morbidity and mortality. Since January 2008 to August 2009, all cancer outpatients consecutively referred to our ward, no more eligible for oncologic therapy, have been evaluated. Demographic, anthropometric and oncologic (site of primary tumour, weight loss in the last 6&#x000a0;months, presence of systemic symptoms and Karnofsky performance status (KPS)) data were collected. Patients have been divided according to the previous body weight loss and the class of KPS (56 have KPS &#x02264;50 and 44 KPS &#x02265;60). Patients were 100 (48 male, 42 female; median, 61&#x000a0;years (38&#x02013;79)), BMI was 19.05&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (13.6&#x02013;27.5), weight loss was 18.6% (range, 6&#x02013;47%; 26 have lost &#x0003c;10% and 74 &#x02265;10%) and primary cancer localization was 32 stomach, 24 colon, 12 ovary, 11 esophagus, 11 pancreas, 6 lung, 2 gallbladder and 2 uterus. All patients complained anorexia and fatigue, in 18 cases associated with dysphagia, in 37 nausea/vomiting, in 12 pain and in 5 mild ascites. Median survival was 4&#x000a0;months (2&#x02013;10): 68 patients survived &#x0003c;4&#x000a0;months and 32 &#x02265;4&#x000a0;months. When patients were divided according to the primary cancer localization and the previous weight loss, prognosis resulted not different in the different groups; when divided according to KPS, survival resulted significantly different (3.7&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.7&#x000a0;months when KPS &#x02264;50 and 5.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;1.4&#x000a0;months in KPS &#x02265;60; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0001). Weight loss and anorexia are frequent in an unselected series of cancer terminal outpatients. Karnofsky results related with survival being a prognostic indicator for terminal cancer patients on HPN. This study is part of an ongoing international prospective investigation on the predictability of survival in incurable cancer patients on HPN.

Our aim of the present study was therefore to determine if overnight provision of a &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; total parenteral nutrition (TPN) regimen was enough to activate translation initiation factors for protein synthesis and transcription of myofibrillar proteins in patients scheduled for surgery.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Patients who underwent surgery in the upper gastrointestinal tract were included in the study and received overnight (12&#x000a0;h) infusions of either saline or TPN as all in one (30&#x000a0;cal/kg/day, 0.16&#x000a0;gN/kg/day) prior to surgery. Infusions lasted until muscle biopsies were taken from the rectus abdominus muscle directly after anaesthesia induction. Initiation factor complexes in the muscle tissue were analysed with immunoprecipitation of proteins followed by Western blot. mRNA expressions of myosin heavy chain 2A (MHC 2A) and actin were measured by real-time PCR.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Standard overnight TPN infusion increased formation of eIF4G&#x000b7;eIF4E complexes and reduced the amount of 4EBP1 found in complex with eIF4E, indicating increased protein synthesis compared to patients who received saline infusions (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05).

With aging, muscle is less sensitive to the stimulatory effects of amino acids. Aging is also characterized by the development of a low-grade inflammation (LGI) with increased plasma levels of cytokines and acute phase proteins (fibrinogen and alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2M)). Whether or not blunting LGI may restore the stimulation of post-prandial (PP) muscle protein synthesis during aging has been assessed.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Eighteen- to 20-month-old rats were divided into a control group (C) and a group treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (ibuprofen (IBU), 30&#x000a0;mg/kg/day). After 5&#x000a0;months of treatment, rats were studied at the post-absorptive (PA) or PP state; muscle proteolysis and protein synthesis were assessed. Signaling pathways (mTOR/S6K1/S6/4EBP1) and FoxO3a were measured.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Body weight, fibrinogen, and alpha2M levels were similar in both groups at the beginning of the experiment. Five months of treatment decreased significantly fibrinogen, alpha2M, and IL6 levels in IBU vs. C. Muscles were significantly heavier in IBU vs. C rats (+6%). As expected, food intake had no effect on muscle protein synthesis and proteolysis in C rats, whereas ibuprofen restored the stimulation of muscle protein synthesis (+25%) and the inhibition of proteolysis (&#x02212;16%). IBU treatment did not affect the mTOR signaling pathway, whereas it restored muscle FoxO3a phosphorylation.</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Prevention of LGI development during aging maintained muscle protein anabolism by food intake and slowed down muscle atrophy in elderly.</p><p><bold>184</bold></p><p><bold>Impaired muscle recovery after immobilization-induced atrophy in old rats is not due to a lack of normalization of the ubiquitin-proteasome-dependant proteolysis or the mitochondria-associated apoptotic pathway</bold></p><p><bold>Hugues Magne, Isabelle Savary-Auzeloux, Emilie Vazeille, Didier Attaix, Dominique Dardevet, Lydie Combaret</bold></p><p>INRA, UMR 1019 Human Nutrition Unit, Saint Gen&#x000e8;s Champanelle, France; Univ Clermont 1, UFR M&#x000e9;decine, UMR 1019 Nutrition Humaine, Clermont-Ferrand, France</p><p><bold>Background and aim:</bold> Sarcopenia might be partially explained by an impaired recovery of skeletal muscle mass after a catabolic state. Associated with this, periods of immobilization increase with age (bed-rest and convalescence) and may contribute by themselves to muscle atrophy during aging. An imbalance of muscle protein metabolism, apoptosis, and cellular regeneration/differentiation is certainly involved. This study aimed to explore the mechanisms involved in muscle atrophy during immobilization and subsequent recovery in old rats.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Forty-eight-old rats were subjected to unilateral hind limb casting immobilization for 8&#x000a0;days (I8) and allowed to recover for 10 to 40&#x000a0;days (R10&#x02013;R40; <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;8 per time). Muscle atrophy, apoptotic (caspase-3 and -9, apoptosome) and proteasome-dependent proteolytic activities, and regeneration/differentiation processes (myogenic factor, Myf5) were assessed in the same rat on both non-immobilized (C) and immobilized (I) gastrocnemius muscles.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> At I8, a significant muscle atrophy (&#x02212;21%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) occurred in the gastrocnemius muscle, and recovery was absent even at R40. In parallel, we observed at I8 (1) an increase of caspases-3 and -9, apoptosome, proteasome chymotrypsin-like activities (+20% to +80%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05), and amount of apoptotic nuclei; (2) a decrease amount in Myf5 (&#x02212;50%, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) in I compared to C. These proteolytic and apoptotic activities were rapidly normalized (R10).</p><p><bold>Conclusion:</bold> Our results showed that a short immobilization period during aging initiated muscle atrophy that was not recovered after 40&#x000a0;days and may then contribute to initiate sarcopenia. The lack of recovery is not due to a defect in proteolysis or apoptosis downregulation during the recovery period and remains to be explored.</p><p><bold>185</bold></p><p><bold>Exercise induced time-dependent transcription in human skeletal muscle</bold></p><p><bold>Joseph P.

The data show a linear relationship between changes in muscle mass and strength gains with training (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;|0.6|, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). There was a rapid and profound change in the muscle transcriptome within 2&#x000a0;days of the first bout of exercise, but many of these changes waned after 35&#x000a0;days of training. The changes clustered into several patterns that range from those genes that changed early, but then returned rapidly to baseline expression levels, to those that changed only after several bouts of exercise and continued to show a change whilst the training program progressed. We have seen that each individual pattern appears to activate different metabolic programs. Thus, the data suggest that muscle undergoes discreet sequential transcriptional changes in response to exercise to affect a series of sequential metabolic changes that ultimately result in the training adaptations observed.</p><p><bold>186</bold></p><p><bold>Muscle quality is associated with longer and less fragmented sedentary time in healthy older men</bold></p><p><bold>Eduardo Ferriolli</bold><sup><bold>1</bold></sup><bold>, Sebastien F.

In men (but not women), muscle quality was significantly associated with not a longer (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.608, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.021) and less fragmented (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;&#x02212;0.620, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.018) pattern of sedentary time, in between longer bouts of activity (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.555, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.039).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In men, an increase in sedentary time and a less fragmented activity pattern may be a consequence of maintaining optimum muscle quality in older age. Sex differences in sedentary activity behaviour need to be resolved further.</p><p><bold>187</bold></p><p><bold>Are thigh adipose depots protective for risk of death in older persons with lower lean mass?

Cachexia is associated with loss of both lean and adipose. Using computerized tomography (CT) data of the thigh from a large population-based study, we explored whether adipose depots imaged in the thigh might be protective for death risk in persons with lower lean.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used mid-thigh CT scan data from 687 men (215 deaths) and 932 women (170 deaths) aged 79&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5.5 in the AGES-Reykjavik follow-up (2002&#x02013;2004) of the randomly chosen Reykjavik Study. Only persons in the lowest tertile of thigh lean cross-sectional area (men &#x0003c;118&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>, women &#x0003c;85&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>) were included. Logistic models were used to assess risk for thigh subcutaneous fat, intermuscular fat, or fatty infiltration into muscle from Hounsfield Unit (HU). Final models were adjusted for age, BMI, height, smoking, functional status, C-reactive protein, lean CSA, and leg strength.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> None of the adipose depots was protective of risk of death. In the men, greater fatty infiltration into muscle increased risk of death (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04 men, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.69 women). In women, smaller lean CSA increased risk of death (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02 women), but lean CSA was not associated with risk in men, adjusting for other confounders (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.44 men).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Within this large population of men and women with lower lean mass, no adipose depot as assessed from CT improved risk of short-term survival. Increased fatty infiltration into muscle as assessed by HU increased risk of death in men only.</p><p><bold>188</bold></p><p><bold>Sarcopenia is predictive of convalescent care in elderly cancer patients following resection of colorectal cancer</bold></p><p><bold>Jessica R.

We tested if muscle depletion (sarcopenia) predicts convalescent care requirement after primary colorectal cancer (CRC) resection.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Stage 2&#x02013;4 CRC patients (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;237) were studied; surgery dates were identified using the Alberta Cancer Registry. A computed tomography (CT) image taken before surgery was used to compute total muscle surface area (square centimeter) at the third lumbar vertebra (L3). Sarcopenia was defined using reported L3 muscle index (L3 muscle (square centimeter)/height (square centimeter)) cut points (female, 38.5&#x000a0;cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>; male, 52.4cm<sup>2</sup>/m<sup>2</sup>; Prado et al., Lancet Oncology 2008). Inpatient hospitalization data from the provincial ministry of health was searched for ICD-10 diagnostic codes suggesting inpatient convalescent care following surgery.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Overall, 39.2% of patients were sarcopenic, and 9.3% of the patients in the entire population received convalescent care. The mean length of stay in convalescent care was 14.4&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;10.5 (SD)&#x02009;days. Of patients, 47.7% were &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years, and 93% of all patients needing convalescent care were in this age group. In patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years, 49.5% of patients were sarcopenic, and the risk of convalescent care after surgery was significantly higher in individuals with sarcopenia compared to those without (25.0% vs. 10.5%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0438, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> test).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Sarcopenia is common before CRC primary tumor resection surgery. Convalescent care largely occurred in patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years, and sarcopenia is a risk factor for this outcome, suggesting functional impairments. This is potentially associated with higher costs and burden on the healthcare system.</p></body><back><ack><p><bold>Open Access</bold> This article is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial License which permits any noncommercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author(s) and source are credited.</p></ack></back></article>

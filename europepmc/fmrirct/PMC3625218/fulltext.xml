The prevalence of BPH is as high as 40% in men in their fifties and 90% in men in their eighties <xref rid="pone.0059449-Nickel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. BPH is one of the most common causes of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) which include frequent urination, urgent urination, nocturia, urinary stream hesitancy, straining to void, and dribbling <xref rid="pone.0059449-Nickel1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Although the pathophysiology of BPH is characterized by non-neoplastic histological changes, urine storage and voiding problems increase patients' risk of urinary tract infection and chronic kidney diseases and adversely affect patients' quality of life <xref rid="pone.0059449-Hong1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059449-Bruskewitz1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Current treatment options for BPH include watchful waiting, lifestyle modifications, alpha blockers, 5 alpha-reductase inhibitors, phytochemicals, and BPH-related surgery <xref rid="pone.0059449-Tanguay1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Although most of the aforementioned therapies have various degrees of documented effectiveness in the management of BPH, the use of these interventions are limited to specific patient populations or have certain side effects that interfere with patient's quality of life <xref rid="pone.0059449-AmericanUrology1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.</p><p>Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine treatment which has been commonly used in the management of LUTS in China for thousands of years. The effects of acupuncture on LUTS were well documented in Chinese medicine textbooks and are well-supported by modern research studies <xref rid="pone.0059449-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Ricci et al <xref rid="pone.0059449-Ricci1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> found that electroacupuncture (EA) had better effects in decreasing number of voiding times of urinary urgency that persisted after transurethral resection of the prostate. Kubista et al <xref rid="pone.0059449-Kubista1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> found that EA could significantly increase the closing pressure in women with stress incontinence as compared with placebo, and Philp et al <xref rid="pone.0059449-Philp1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> found that acupuncture increased the bladder capacity in patients with bladder instability.

In addition, we also compared the therapeutic effectiveness of EA at bilateral acupoints of BL33 with EA at non-acupoints (2 cun [around 6.7 cm] lateral to BL33s) in a randomized controlled pilot study; the results demonstrated acupoint EA was more effective than non-acupoint EA in reducing IPSS <xref rid="pone.0059449-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. However, terazosin is not necessarily the standardized treatment option for patients with BPH and the pilot study related to effects of acupoint on the EA treatment of BPH has a relative small sample size with efficacy measurements of IPSS only <xref rid="pone.0059449-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Theories of traditional Chinese medicine and results from modern studies indicate that acupoints of the fourteen meridians have specific functional regulatory effect on zang-fu organs <xref rid="pone.0059449-Shuran1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>; however, studies in western countries found that dry needling, an acupuncture procedure at trigger points (including non-acupoints that do not belong to the meridian system), were effective in the management of various diseases <xref rid="pone.0059449-Draolu1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Kalichman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

In the original study protocol, patients with IPSS score higher than 20 (including 20) were proposed to be excluded; however, we changed the inclusion criteria to patients with IPSS&#x02265;8 during the actual study, as most patients who visited the acupuncture department and were willing to participate in the study had moderate to severe BPH. The study design complies with the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Participants were recruited through advertisements on local newspapers and posters and signed informed consent before study participation.</p><p>Sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes were distributed to patients by an investigator who was not involved in acupuncture procedures and data analyses.

In traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture at Baliao points (BL31-34) are commonly used as treatment options for LUTS, lumbodynia, and reproductive disorders <xref rid="pone.0059449-Wang1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>; our previous study confirmed the effects of acupuncture at BL33 on LUTS <xref rid="pone.0059449-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In the present study, BL33s were used in the acupoint treatment group; whereas the two points which are 2 cun (around 6.7 cm) lateral to BL33s were used in the non-acupoint control group. Localization of BL33 which corresponds with the third sacral foramen was reported previously <xref rid="pone.0059449-Liu1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In order to accuratelylocalize bilateral BL33, a line is drawn between the two posterior superior iliac spines (PSIS) which cross over at point A of the spinal column. Then, each PSIS and point A are connected to construct two separate lines. Finally, two different equilateral triangles are drawn inferiorly and the apexes B and C of these two equilateral triangles are the two BL33 acupoints. The acupuncturists inserted acupuncture needles at BL33obliquely at an angle of about 45&#x000b0; for about 6 cm&#x02013;8 cm until the patient felt heaviness and numbness locally or even with radiation sensation to the genitalia. Acupuncture procedures were performed bilaterally at two BL33 acupoints and electrodes of the electric stimulator were attached to the handle of the needle bilaterally. Disperse-dense wave, 20 Hz electric current was used in the present study. The intensity of electric current was increased to the patients' maximum tolerance and then slightly reduced to a bearable level. Acupuncture treatment protocol and electric stimulator parameters were the same for non-acupoint acupuncture procedures in the control group, except for the genitalial radiating sensation upon acupuncture.</p><p>Patients received a total of 16 sessions of acupuncture treatment which include five sessions in the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> week, acupuncture once a day; three sessions in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> week, acupuncture every other day.

SPSS statistical package program (ver.16.0) was used and a significance level was set at &#x003b1;&#x0003c;0.05. Data analysis of baseline characteristics was based on the intention-to-treat (ITT) population which included all participants who were randomized. Primary and secondary outcomes were mainly based on the data of the ITT population; however, primary outcome was also analyzed based on per-protocol (PP) population as an extra supportive analysis. Quantitative data of IPSS and Qmax were expressed with mean&#x000b1;SD; PVR was expresses as Range (Median) as the data was not normally distributed. For primary and secondary outcome measures, analysis of covariance was used to investigate the differences between acupoint acupuncture and non-acupoint acupuncture on IPSS and Qmax. Changes of the IPSS and Qmax after treatment were the dependent variable, the group was the fixed factor and the baseline data were the covariate.

Hematoma disappeared in about two weeks.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The results of this trial showed that greater decrease in IPSS in the BL33 group than in the non-acupoint group, but no significant difference was found in Qmax and PVR. The change of IPSS indicates that EA at acupoints significantly improved the quality of life in patients diagnosed with BPH. The IPSS change matched the results of our previous studies and added further credence in the use of acupuncture for patients with BPH <xref rid="pone.0059449-Yang1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The IPSS was decreased by 7.26 (from20.10 to 12.84, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.000) and 2.34 (from 18.76 to 16.42, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001) in BL33 acupoint EA group and the non-point EA group respectively. Compared to the non-point control group, the acupoint group was associated with a 4.51-point greater decline in IPSS at the 6th week (P&#x0003c;0.01). The difference of IPSS decrease indicates that EA at acupoints had significantly better effects than EA at non-acupoint on the quality of life in patients diagnosed with BPH. As EA procedures at both acupoint and non-acupoint share the same electric stimulation parameters and same EA protocol, the specificity of needling site at BL33 acupoint may be accountable for the difference in IPSS in the present study. This echoed the results of our pilot study stating that acupoints have better effects than non-acupoints <xref rid="pone.0059449-Ding1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. The results of the present study also increases the credibility of results of other related studies indicating that the acupoint of the meridian system seem to have specific functional regulatory effects compared to non-acupoints <xref rid="pone.0059449-Shuran1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Xu1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p><p>In a similar trial comparing EA with sham EA (shallow needle insertion of 2 mm) for BPH, greater increase of Qmax was found in the EA group than the sham EA group; whereas IPSS was similar in both groups <xref rid="pone.0059449-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. With a close analysis, acupoints use, manipulation methods, parameters of EA and number, frequency and duration of treatment sessions could all cause the differences between the two studies. Nonetheless, both studies demonstrated that standard EA at acupoint had better effects than EA with shallow needle insertion of 2 mm or EA at non-acupoints on at least certain clinical parameter(s). In addition, IPSS improve in the present study is also supported by results from the study by Johnstone et al <xref rid="pone.0059449-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> in which some difference in IPSS (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.063) was found between acupuncture and blank control. As only 20 out of 30 patients were treated with acupuncture in the study by Johnstone et al <xref rid="pone.0059449-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, the p value is likely to drop to lower than 0.05 if the sample size is increased. Consequently, we should believe the specificity of acupoints in acupuncture treatment even though the mechanism of acupuncture at acupoints has not been fully elucidated.</p><p>Studies demonstrate that sacral neuromodulation could improve symptoms of overactive bladder <xref rid="pone.0059449-Wendy1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Vignes1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. As BL33 is actually the third sacral nerve which travels through the 3<sup>rd</sup> sacral foramen, we should believe that EA at BL33 is actually one type of sacral neuromodulation. Sacral acupuncture was found to be effective in improving symptoms of acetic acid-induced bladder irritation in rats through inhibition of capsaicin-sensitive C-fiber activation <xref rid="pone.0059449-Hino1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. Therefore, EA for BPH may be related to acupuncture sacral neuromododulation.</p><p>Although the exact mechanism of EA treatment for BPH has yet to be clarified, researchers believe that the effects of acupuncture are less likely to be related to histological changes of the prostate, as no difference was found in PSA levels, between sham and vera EA and between acupuncture and blank control <xref rid="pone.0059449-Yu2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0059449-Johnstone1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. As results of acupuncture fMRI studies showed a significant connection between brain activities and acupuncture procedures, and the human brain is closely involved in the sensation and control of the lower urinary system <xref rid="pone.0059449-Fang1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0059449-Napadow1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, we should also believe that brain modulation by acupuncture may also play a role in the effects of EA on BPH. This was confirmed by in-vivo animal study in which Chung et al <xref rid="pone.0059449-Chung1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> found that expression of c-Fos expression in the pontine micturition center (PMC), ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG), and medial preoptic nucleus (MPA) was increased in stress urinary incontinence, and acupuncture significantly decreased c-Fos expression in these areas. Nonetheless, further studies are needed to explore the mechanism of acupuncture on BPH.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Limitations</title><p>As blinding is difficult in acupuncture studies, real randomized placebo controlled trials seem impossible. Although non-acupoint EA procedures were used as control in the present study, they are still acupuncture procedures; thus we could not rule out the confounding factor of needling and placebo effects in the present study. Patients in the present study were only treated for 4 weeks and followed up till the 18th week, long term effects and optimal treatment regimens of EA for BPH remain to be established. In addition, this RCT was performed in only one hospital rather than multi-centers; therefore, the results of the present study may not well-characterize the general response of patients with BPH in the world. To further test the therapeutic effects of EA on BPH, further large scale, multi-center, international cooperative studies are warranted.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, acupoint EA at BL 33 had better effects on IPSS, but no difference on PVR and Qmax as compared with non-acupoint EA. The results indicate that EA is effective in improving patient's quality of life and acupoint may have better therapeutic effects than non-acupoints in acupuncture treatments of BPH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0059449.s001"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0059449.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0059449.s002"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0059449.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0059449-Nickel1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">

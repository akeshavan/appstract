Early introduction of psycho-social interventions can address cognitive decline and significantly impact quality of life and the wellbeing of elderly individuals. This pilot study explores the feasibility of using art therapy and music reminiscence activity to improve the cognition of community living elderly with mild cognitive impairment.Methods/DesignThis open-label, interventional study involves a parallel randomized controlled trial design with three arms (two intervention arms and a control group) over a nine-month period. Participants will be community-living elderly individuals aged 60–85 years, both genders, who meet predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the initial three months, interventions will be provided weekly and for the remaining six months fortnightly. A sample size of 90 participants is targeted based on expected neuropsychological test performance, a primary outcome measure, and drop-out rates. The randomization procedure will be carried out via a web-based randomization system. Interventions will be provided by trained staff with a control group not receiving any intervention but continuing life as usual. Assessments will be done at baseline, three months, and nine months, and include neuroimaging to measure cerebral changes and neuropsychological tests to measure for changes in cognition. Secondary outcome measures will include mood changes in anxiety and depression and telomere lengths. Statistical analysis will be undertaken by statisticians; all efficacy analysis will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Primary and secondary outcomes will be modeled using the linear mixed model for repeated measurements and further analysis may be undertaken to adjust for potential confounders.DiscussionThis will be the first study to compare the effectiveness of art therapy and music reminiscence activity in a randomized controlled trial. We expect that the trial will provide useful evidence for developing psychosocial interventions for the elderly with mild cognitive impairment.Trial registrationThe study was registered on 7 July 2016 at Clinical Trials.gov, a service of the US National Institute of Health (NCT02854085), retrospectively.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13063-017-2080-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.KeywordsArt therapyMusic reminiscence activityMild cognitive impairmentRandomized controlled trialKwan Im Choo Thong Cho Temple Ν-177-000-004-001KuaEe Heokissue-copyright-statement© The Author(s) 2017<sec xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Aims of study</title><p id="Par28">This pilot study aims to explore the feasibility of using AT and MRA to improve the cognition of community living elderly with MCI (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-5: Mild Neurocognitive Disorder) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par29">The primary outcomes will be the structural cerebral changes that occur with the two interventions and the extent to which the therapies may reverse cognitive impairment and/or prevent further cognitive decline on neuropsychological tests of cognition.

The duration of nine months was used in previous RCTs of psychosocial interventions at our center and provided a trial length of sufficient duration which yielded measurable changes. The protocol was prepared according to the Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) guidelines (see Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>, Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>, and Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). Interventions will be weekly for the first three months, then fortnightly for the remaining six months. Weekly interventions provide greater practice effects and improvements in cognition and brain function, if any, can be detected by three months. In the subsequent six months, the frequency of the interventions has been increased to fortnightly, based on previous trial experience that monthly interventions do not sustain the early gains. Study evaluations will be done by comparing the two intervention groups (AT and MRA) and a control group. Participants will have written informed consent taken, screening, and baseline measures completed before randomization into one of the three study arms.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Workflow plan for participants</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2017_2080_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

It will have two components: creation of art pieces; and viewing and discussing art pieces with narration of thoughts and inner experiences. Studies have shown that visual art production interventions and cognitive art evaluation groups benefit the individual but in slightly different ways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Hence, this study will include both activities and consider them as one intervention.</p><p id="Par53">The guided viewing and making of visual images and talk therapy with an art therapist contributes to externalization of thoughts and feelings which may otherwise remain unexpressed. Each weekly session will begin with mindful relaxation to help the participants focus on the task ahead. They will be asked to draw anything they want or what they think is relevant to the topic for each session. They will then be asked to share about the picture they have created, feelings, and perspectives, first in pairs and then with the group where image appreciation activities will be used to help participants gain insights and discuss their feelings.</p><p id="Par54">In addition, participants will visit both the National Art Gallery and the National University of Singapore Art Museum once a month in the first three months. They will view displayed artworks in guided sessions and will be invited to share their views and feelings about the artefacts. Each of the AT sessions will last 1 h (inclusive of 5 min of mindful relaxation and a 15-min break). From the fourth to ninth month, fortnightly AT sessions are provided with sessions at the study center alternating with sessions at the National Art Gallery or National University of Singapore Art Museum. Participants will visit the Art Gallery and Art Museum, first, because the art pieces cannot be removed from these places and brought to the research center; second, two sites are involved because neither one of the sites has sufficient docents to manage the number of visits alone. With two sites, each site will host the participants’ visit only once a month in the first three months and then in alternate months for the next six months. Participants will be taken to the Art Gallery and Museum by coach and will be accompanied by research staff during the 15-min journey.</p><sec id="Sec9"><title>Content of the art therapy intervention</title><p id="Par55">Weekly sessions:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p id="Par56">Session 1: Art and expression</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par57">Session 2: Friendship</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par58">Session 3: Visit to the NUS Art Museum</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par59">Session 4: Visit to the National Art Gallery</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par60">Session 5: Emotions and feelings</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par61">Session 6: Family</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par62">Session 7: Visit to the NUS Art Museum</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par63">Session 8: Visit to the National Art Gallery</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par64">Session 9: Happiness</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par65">Session 10: Hopes and wishes</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par66">Session 11: Visit to the NUS Art Museum</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par67">Session 12: Visit to the National Art Gallery</p></list-item></list>

Pharmacological treatment studies have shown a reversal of medial prefrontal deficits in response to traumatic reminders. Mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) is a promising non-pharmacologic approach to the treatment of anxiety and pain disorders. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of MBSR on PTSD symptoms and brain response to traumatic reminders measured with positron-emission tomography (PET) in Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF) combat veterans with PTSD. We hypothesized that MBSR would show increased prefrontal response to stress and improved PTSD symptoms in veterans with PTSD.MethodTwenty-six OEF/OIF combat veterans with PTSD who had recently returned from a combat zone were block randomized to receive eight sessions of MBSR or present-centered group therapy (PCGT). PTSD patients underwent assessment of PTSD symptoms with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), mindfulness with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and brain imaging using PET in conjunction with exposure to neutral and Iraq combat-related slides and sound before and after treatment. Nine patients in the MBSR group and 8 in the PCGT group completed all study procedures.ResultsPost-traumatic stress disorder patients treated with MBSR (but not PCGT) had an improvement in PTSD symptoms measured with the CAPS that persisted for 6 months after treatment. MBSR also resulted in an increase in mindfulness measured with the FFMQ. MBSR-treated patients had increased anterior cingulate and inferior parietal lobule and decreased insula and precuneus function in response to traumatic reminders compared to the PCGT group.ConclusionThis study shows that MBSR is a safe and effective treatment for PTSD. Furthermore, MBSR treatment is associated with changes in brain regions that have been implicated in PTSD and are involved in extinction of fear responses to traumatic memories as well as regulation of the stress response.stress disorderspost-traumaticbrain imagingpositron-emission tomographymindfulness trainingmindfulness-based stress reductionanterior cingulate cortexinsulaNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute10.13039/100000050R01 HL088726, K24 HL077506National Institute of Mental Health10.13039/100000025K24 MH076955, T32 MH067547, R01 MH56120National Center for Research Resources10.13039/100000097S10 RR016917U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs10.13039/100000738VET HEAL/Samueli<sec xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were male veterans aged 18–65 years returning from a combat deployment in Iraq or Afghanistan as part of OEF and OIF-OEF/OIF. All veterans had returned from deployment in the past year, had not been treated with psychotropic medications in the previous 4 weeks, and had the diagnosis of combat-related PTSD. All participants were recruited through fliers and public bulletins distributed within the community and the Mental Health Assessment Team at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. This study was approved by the Investigational Review Board of Emory University, and all enrolled subjects provided written informed consent. All participants spoke fluent English and had at least an eighth grade reading ability. Participants were considered ineligible if they had experienced significant head trauma or loss of consciousness for at least 2 min, or if they reported significant medical histories, current alcohol or substance abuse, or psychotic illness as identified by DSM-IV criteria in the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID), or the diagnosis of PTSD preceding military service (<xref rid="B113" ref-type="bibr">113</xref>).</p><p>A total of 26 PTSD patients were found to be eligible and were randomly assigned in blocks to MBSR therapy (<italic>N</italic> = 17) and the control treatment, PCGT (<italic>N</italic> = 9). Nine subjects completed the MBSR group and eight the PCGT group as well as the other study procedures. Before attending the first class, three MBSR subjects dropped out because of lack of interest, and five because of lack of transportation and work-related issues. One member of the PCGT moved out of town before attending the first PCGT group. There were no differences in age, race, or years of education between the two groups (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demographic factors in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder related to Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom combat randomized to mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and present-centered group therapy (PCGT).</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MBSR (<italic>N</italic> = 9)</th><th valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PCGT (<italic>N</italic> = 8)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">34 (7 SD)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">35 (10 SD)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Race</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 White, 4 African-American</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 White, 3 African-American</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Years of education</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16 (2)</td><td align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 (2)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="S2-2"><title>Treatment</title><p>All enrolled participants were randomized (by an outside researcher) by block to 8 weeks of treatment with MBSR or PCGT. The 8-week, 9-session MBSR intervention provides systematic and intensive training in mindfulness through formal meditation and mindful hatha yoga exercises, as well as application of their principles to everyday life and the range of challenges arising from real-life stressors and chronic diseases. In this way, participants were supported in becoming more aware of their internal resources and in acquiring skills that could be flexibly applied to cope more effectively with stress and PTSD symptoms. This range of self-regulatory skills were aimed at increasing relaxation and proprioceptive awareness, as well as awareness of the mind/body experiences related to their PTSD-related emotions and thoughts, overall sense of self, and self-in-relationship. Groups met for eight weekly, 2 1/2 h sessions and an all-day (6 h) session during week 6. The MBSR expert on the study team (JC) tailored the MBSR teaching materials to veterans, using metaphors that they could relate to, such as using analogies of attending to one’s breathing to training in sniper fire.</p><p>Formal mindfulness training was through: (a) body scan meditation, a gradual moving of attention through the body from feet to head accompanied by awareness of breathing and other bodily sensations while lying in a supine position, (b) sitting meditation, focusing on the awareness of breathing, bodily sensations, thoughts, and emotions, practiced sitting upright on a chair or cushion, and (c) mindful hatha yoga, stretching, and strengthening exercises practiced with awareness of breathing and intended to develop awareness (mindfulness) during movement. Participants were given two guided meditation CDs to be practiced at home for 30 min, 6 days/week. Subjects were assessed to determine the degree to which they followed homework assignments. In-class didactic material emphasized the systematic development of mindfulness awareness and its application in everyday life. Additional discussion focused on the psychology and physiology of stress reactivity and suggestions for the application of mindfulness as a method for responding positively to stress.</p><p>Mindfulness-based stress reduction instructors were trained by the Center for Mindfulness at the University of Massachusetts. All instructors and therapists did not participate in the research assessments. MBSR instructors were supervised by a research psychologist with expertise in MBSR (JC). Recordings were made of sessions which were reviewed by the supervisor to ensure adherence to treatment integrity.</p><p>In this study, PCGT was used as a control for the non-specific effects of a group-based intervention. PCGT was initially developed for use as a control group in a VA multisite study that tested the effects of trauma-focused group therapy in veterans with combat-related PTSD (no difference between the two groups was found for the treatment of PTSD) (<xref rid="B114" ref-type="bibr">114</xref>). The primary elements of PCGT include expectations of symptom reduction, normalization of PTSD symptoms though education, decreasing isolation, the opportunity to both give and receive support, and have positive experiences with others who also suffer from similar symptoms. PCGT also offers an atmosphere of safety and support where subjects can have an increased awareness of how PT SD affects their daily lives and those of other group members, and can gain more perspective and objectivity about the effects of PTSD on their lives. PCGT emphasized a “here-and-now” focus that avoided discussion of the trauma, as done in exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring. PCGT groups were conducted for the same number of hours as the MBSR groups. The initial phase of PCGT treatment was psycho-educational. After this phase, the primary content of PCGT was discussion of everyday problems of group members and coming to a better understanding of how PTSD creates or intensifies these problems. At the end of the program, there was a barbecue to balance the mindful retreat of the active group.</p></sec><sec id="S2-3"><title>Measures</title><p>The CAPS was used to assess PTSD symptoms at baseline and in response to treatment. The CAPS is a psychometrically sound measure that assesses presence and severity of PTSD (both lifetime and current PTSD) and can be used to assess changes in PTSD symptoms with treatment (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>). The CAPS includes indices measuring reexperiencing, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal symptoms. The CAPS has a coefficient alpha of 0.94, test–retest reliability of 0.9–0.98, a sensitivity of 0.91, and specificity of 0.86 for diagnosis of PTSD, and good convergent and divergent validity (<xref rid="B115" ref-type="bibr">115</xref>, <xref rid="B116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>).</p><p>Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (with PTSD module) was used to establish psychiatric diagnosis. The PTSD module of the SCID has been shown to have a kappa of 0.93 for test–retest reliability, and excellent sensitivity (0.81) and specificity (0.98) against a composite PTSD diagnosis (<xref rid="B117" ref-type="bibr">117</xref>).</p><p>Mindfulness was assessed with the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ), a validated measure of the capacity for mindfulness (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>). This instrument was derived from a factor analysis of questionnaires measuring a trait-like general tendency to be mindful in daily life. It consists of 39 items assessing five facets of mindfulness: observing, describing, acting with awareness, non-judging of inner experience, and non-reactivity to inner experience. Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (never or very rarely true) to 5 (very often or always true). The FFMQ has been shown to have good internal consistency and significant relationships in the predicted directions with a variety of constructs related to mindfulness (<xref rid="B118" ref-type="bibr">118</xref>, <xref rid="B119" ref-type="bibr">119</xref>).</p><p>Mindful spirituality was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp), a valid and reliable 12-item scale designed to measure spiritual well-being independent of religious beliefs (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>). It has been adapted for use with non-medical populations and comprises two subscales: Meaning and Peace (8 items) and Faith (4 items) (<xref rid="B121" ref-type="bibr">121</xref>). The FACIT-Sp (<xref rid="B120" ref-type="bibr">120</xref>) is part of the FACIT battery (<xref rid="B122" ref-type="bibr">122</xref>) to assess QOL associated with chronic illness.</p></sec><sec id="S2-4"><title>PET Procedures</title><p>High-resolution positron-emission tomography scanning was conducted using methods previously described (<xref rid="B94" ref-type="bibr">94</xref>). HR-PET imaging of the brain was performed with the high-resolution research tomograph (CTI, Knoxville, TN, USA) (&lt;2 mm resolution) (<xref rid="B123" ref-type="bibr">123</xref>, <xref rid="B124" ref-type="bibr">124</xref>). Subjects were scanned during exposure to traumatic (Iraqi combat) slides, and sounds, and neutral slides and sounds using methods previously described (<xref rid="B125" ref-type="bibr">125</xref>). Subjects underwent four scans in conjunction with injection of radiolabeled water: two successive scans while watching neutral slides and sounds, followed by two scans while viewing combat-related slides and sounds. Content of the slides was matched between combat and neutral for sound and content, e.g., scenes involving persons and buildings in Iraq with loud noises were matched with a city scene with buildings and persons and city traffic noises. Radiolabeled water (H<sub>2</sub>[<sup>15</sup>O]) was prepared on-site in a cyclotron. During the hours of the test, subjects reclined in bed except to use the bathroom. An intravenous infusion of normal saline was started by a technologist to permit the bolus injection of radiolabeled water. Subjects were scanned with eyes open in a dimly lit room. Subjects were placed in the scanner with the head held in a head holder, and the head was positioned with the canthomeatal line parallel to the external laser light. Following positioning within the camera gantry, a transmission scan of the head was obtained. Subjects received a 20 mCi intravenous bolus of radiolabeled water for each of the scans. Subjects were scanned twice during exposure to neutral slides and sounds (city scenes with people, buildings, city sounds, people talking, birds tweeting), and twice during exposure to Iraq combat scenes and sounds. Each scan lasted 60 s, with the PET scan acquisition beginning at the initiation of the condition.</p></sec><sec id="S2-5"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms as measured with the CAPS were compared before and after intervention with MBSR or PCGT using one-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests with significance defined as <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05. HR-PET images were reconstructed and analyzed using Statistical Parametric Mapping software (SPM8) (<xref rid="B126" ref-type="bibr">126</xref>, <xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>). Regions of interest were identified within hypothesized brain regions (mPFC, parietal cortex, insula, precuneus) using standard stereotactic coordinates (<xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). Images were realigned to the first scan of the study session. The mean concentration of radioactivity in each scan was obtained as an area-weighted sum of the concentration of each slice, and was adjusted to a nominal value of 50 ml/min per 100 g. The data underwent transformation into a common anatomical space and were smoothed with a three-dimensional Gaussian filter to 8-mm FWHM. Regional blood flow was compared for traumatic minus neutral slides, and sounds conditions. Statistical analyses yielded image data sets in which the values assigned to individual voxels correspond to the <italic>t</italic> statistic. Statistical images were displayed with values of <italic>z</italic> score units. Location of areas of activation was identified as the distance from the anterior commissure in millimeters, with <italic>x, y</italic>, and <italic>z</italic> coordinates; a standard stereotaxic (Talairach) atlas was used (<xref rid="B128" ref-type="bibr">128</xref>). A threshold <italic>z</italic> score of 2.67 (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, uncorrected) and a minimal cluster of 11 voxels was used to examine areas of activation within hypothesized areas (medial prefrontal and parietal cortex, precuneus, insula) (<xref rid="B127" ref-type="bibr">127</xref>, <xref rid="B129" ref-type="bibr">129</xref>, <xref rid="B130" ref-type="bibr">130</xref>). This level of significance has been shown to optimize the reduction of risk of both Type 1 and Type 2 errors (<xref rid="B131" ref-type="bibr">131</xref>, <xref rid="B132" ref-type="bibr">132</xref>). Activations in non-hypothesized regions meeting this statistical threshold were also presented for the purpose of hypothesis generation for future studies.</p></sec></sec>ResultsThere were no differences in demographic variables between PTSD patients randomized to either MBSR or PCGT (Table 1). Eight weeks of MBSR therapy (but not PCGT) resulted in significant reductions in PTSD symptoms (Figure 1; Table 2). These effects persisted 6 months after the ends of treatment (Figure 1). The greatest reductions in symptoms were seen in the CAPS hyperarousal symptom cluster in the MBSR group [31 (14 SD) baseline versus 16 (11 SD)] (p &lt; 0.006) although significant changes were seen in the avoidance (but not intrusion) cluster as well. MBSR also resulted in an increase in mindfulness as measured by the FFMQ (Table 2) as well as a non-statistically significant increase of 23% in spiritual mindfulness as measured by the FACIT-Sp (p = 0.06; Table 2). Increases were equally seen in the Faith and Meaning/Purpose Subscales.Figure 1Effects of 8 weeks of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), or present-centered group therapy (PCGT) on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as measured with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). There was a significant reduction in PTSD symptoms immediately posttreatment in the MBSR group (p &lt; 0.05), but not in the PCGT group. These effects persisted at the 6-month follow-up period.Table 2Effects of MBSR and PCGT on symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder and measures of mindfulness and spirituality.MeasurePre-MBSRPost-MBSRPre-PCGTPost-PCGTp-Value*CAPS-I10 (9 SD)3 (4 SD)7 (8 SD)8 (5 SD)0.14CAPS-Av16 (9 SD)8 (7 SD)13 (6 SD)8 (4 SD)0.026CAPS-Ar31 (14 SD)16 (11 SD)32 (6 SD)27 (8 SD)0.006CAPS-TOTAL56 (29 SD)28 (20 SD)51 (14 SD)43 (15 SD)0.016FFMQ121 (11 SD)139 (22 SD)121 (19 SD)127 (23 SD)0.04FACIT-Sp52 (18 SD)64 (21 SD)58 (16 SD)61 (18 SD)0.06CAPS-I, CAPS-Intrusions Subscale; CAPS-Av, CAPS-Avoidance Subscale; CAPS-Ar, CAPS-Arousal Subscale; CAPS-TOTAL, CAPS total score; FFMQ, Five Factor Mindfulness Scale; FACIT-Sp, Functional Assessment of Cancer Illness Therapy-Spirituality Subscale; PCGT, present-centered group therapy; MBSR, mindfulness-based stress reduction.*p-Value for difference between outcome before and after MBSR therapy.Exposure to combat-related slides, and sounds resulted in increased activation in multiple frontal, and temporal cortical brain regions in both the MBSR and PCGT-treated groups (Tables 3–6).

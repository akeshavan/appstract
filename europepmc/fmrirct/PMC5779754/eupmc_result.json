    "Stroke is one of leading diseases causing adult death and disability worldwide. Home-based telerehabilitation has become a novel approach for stroke patients as effective as conventional rehabilitation, and more convenient and economical than conventional rehabilitation. However, there is no study assessing the mechanism of home-based telerehabilitation in promoting motor recovery among stroke patients with hemiplegic.This study is designed to determine the efficacy and explore the mechanism of motor recovery after home-based telerehabilitation in stroke patients with motor deficits.In a single-blinded randomized controlled pilot study, patients with acute subcortical stroke (n = 40) are assigned to receive home-based telerehabilitation or conventional rehabilitation. Task-based or resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and Fugl-Meyer assessment (FMA) score will acquired before and after rehabilitation. Activation volume of bilateral primary motor (M1), supplementary motor area (SMA), premotor cortex (PMC); lateralization index (LI) of interhemispheric M1, SMA, and PMC; functional connectivity of bilateral M1, SMA, PMC; fractional anisotropy (FA) will be measured; correlation analyses will be performed between neuroimaging biomarkers and FMA score pre- and postrehabilitation.We present a study design and rationale to explore the effectiveness and neural mechanism of home-based rehabilitation for stroke patients with motor deficits. The study limitations related to the small-amount sample. Moreover, home-based rehabilitation may provide an alternative means of recovery for stroke patients. Ultimately, results of this trial will help to understand the neural mechanism of home-based telerehabilitation among stroke patients with hand movement disorder."

Interventions that target these cognitive deficits and the associated difficulties with activities of daily living are the subject of ever-growing interest. Cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are specific forms of non-pharmacological intervention to address cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes. The present review is an abridged version of a Cochrane Review and aims to systematically evaluate the evidence for these forms of intervention in people with mild Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), published in English, comparing cognitive rehabilitation or cognitive training interventions with control conditions and reporting relevant outcomes for the person with dementia or the family caregiver (or both), were considered for inclusion. Eleven RCTs reporting cognitive training interventions were included in the review. A large number of measures were used in the different studies, and meta-analysis could be conducted for several primary and secondary outcomes of interest. Several outcomes were not measured in any of the studies. Overall estimates of the treatment effect were calculated by using a fixed-effects model, and statistical heterogeneity was measured by using a standard chi-squared statistic. One RCT of cognitive rehabilitation was identified, allowing the examination of effect sizes, but no meta-analysis could be conducted. Cognitive training was not associated with positive or negative effects in relation to any of the reported outcomes. The overall quality of the trials was low to moderate. The single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation found promising results in relation to some patient and caregiver outcomes and was generally of high quality. The available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. However, there is still no indication of any significant benefits from cognitive training. Trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardized outcome measures. The results of the single RCT of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. Further well-designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to provide more definitive evidence. Researchers should describe and classify their interventions appropriately by using the available terminology.<sec xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xmlns:mml="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This review is an abridged version of a regularly maintained and recently updated Cochrane Review on the topic. For a detailed description of the review methodology, readers are referred to the complete version in the CDSR. Central elements of the methodology are summarized below.</p><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>To be considered for inclusion, studies had to be RCTs of cognitive training or cognitive rehabilitation (consistent with the definitions provided above) for individuals with mild to moderate AD or VaD and had to be published in English. Interventions could be delivered individually or in groups, with or without the inclusion of family caregivers. At a minimum, studies had to include pre- and post-intervention assessments using standardized measures.</p><p>A range of outcomes were considered, and these were broadly classified into the following:</p><p>1. Cognitive and non-cognitive outcomes for the person with dementia (for example, performance on objective measures by cognitive domain, self-rated cognitive functioning, mood, well-being, and quality of life).</p><p>2. Outcomes for the primary caregiver (mood, burden of care, quality of life, and so on).</p><p>3. Effects of the intervention on the course of dementia (global dementia severity and rates of admission to residential care).</p><p>Outcomes of studies of cognitive training and of cognitive rehabilitation were considered separately. In addition, separate comparisons were conducted for outcomes in the short term (that is, the first assessment after intervention) and, where available, the medium (2 to 12 months after intervention) and long (&gt;12 months) term. To contribute to the meta-analysis of a given outcome, studies had to have measured the outcome with at least one standardized measure or questionnaire.</p></sec><sec><title>Search methods</title><p>The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register ALOIS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] - was most recently searched on 2 November 2012. ALOIS is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, dementia treatment, and cognitive enhancement in healthy individuals. For a comprehensive list of sources included in the ALOIS database, readers are referred to the ALOIS website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection and analysis</title><p>The latest search results (covering the period of April 2006 to November 2012) were reviewed by AB-F, who identified all relevant RCTs of cognition-based interventions in mild AD or VaD and retrieved the full texts. Two review authors (AB-F and LC) independently reviewed each article to determine whether inclusion criteria were met. There were no disagreements regarding the inclusion of studies. All relevant data were extracted from the studies selected for inclusion, recorded in a data-entry form, and entered into Review Manager (RevMan) for statistical analyses. Additional information was sought from study authors as appropriate. Change from baseline statistics was calculated from the group means and standard deviations at baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up. The meta-analysis was conducted on change-from-baseline scores. Outcome measures were treated as continuous measures. In some cases, outcomes were derived from ordinal rating scales; provided that these contained a reasonably large number of categories (&gt;10), the data were treated as continuous variables arising from a normal distribution.</p><p>The mean difference with 95% confidence intervals was used whenever studies used the same outcome measure, and the standardized mean difference, which is the absolute mean difference divided by the pooled standard deviation, was used when the same outcome was assessed using different measures. Overall estimates of the treatment effect were calculated with a fixed-effects model by using the inverse variance method.</p><p>Statistical heterogeneity was assessed by using a standard chi-squared statistic and associated l2 statistic. Consistent with recommendations, heterogeneity was deemed to be present when the chi-squared statistic was significant at a <italic>P </italic>value of 0.1 or the l2 suggested that more than 40% of the variability in effect estimate was due to heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. As no evidence of statistical heterogeneity was found, all analyses were conducted by using a fixed-effects model.</p></sec></sec>AbbreviationsAD: Alzheimer's disease; CDSR: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; fMRI: functional magnetic resonance imaging; MCI: mild cognitive impairment; RCT: randomized controlled trial; VaD: vascular dementia.Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.AcknowledgementsAB-F is supported by funding from the Dementia Collaborative Research Centre-Early Detection and Prevention and would like to acknowledge the support of the Rosemary Foundation Travel Fellowship awarded to him by the Alzheimer's Australia Research Foundation.ReiflerBVLarsonELight E, Liebowitz BExcess disability in dementia of the Alzheimer's typeAlzheimer's Disease Treatment and Family Stress: Directions for Research1990New York: HemisphereSalomoneSCaraciFLeggioGMFedotovaJDragoFNew pharmacological strategies for treatment of Alzheimer's disease: focus on disease modifying drugsBr J Clin Pharmacol2012550451710.1111/j.1365-2125.2011.04134.x22035455SmallGWRabinsPVBarryPPBuckholtzNSDeKoskySTFerrisSHFinkelSIGwytherLPKhachaturianZSLebowitzBDMcRaeTDMorrisJCOakleyFSchneiderLSStreimJESunderlandTTeriLATuneLEDiagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer disease and related disorders: consensus statement of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry, the Alzheimer's Association and the American Geriatric SocietyJAMA199751363137110.1001/jama.1997.035501600830439343469WoodsRTClareLTuokko H, Hultsch DCognition-based therapies and mild cognitive impairmentPerspectives on Mild Cognitive Impairment.

Forty patients with bipolar disorder in full or partial remission, aged 18 to 50&#x000a0;years, who report moderate to severe cognitive difficulties, are recruited. Patients are randomized to receive weekly group-based cognitive remediation treatment over 12&#x000a0;weeks in addition to standard treatment or standard treatment alone. Both groups undergo neurocognitive testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline, post-treatment (week 12) and follow-up (week 26). The primary outcome is improved verbal memory, as measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) from baseline to post-treatment. With inclusion of 40 patients we obtain 86% power to detect a clinically relevant difference in verbal memory between groups. Secondary outcomes are improved attention, executive function and psychosocial function, as measured with the Rapid Visual Information Processing test, the Trail Making Test part B and the Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST), respectively.

Despite medical treatment with mood stabilizers, newer antipsychotics and antidepressants, a large proportion of patients with BD experience persistent and debilitating cognitive dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In particular, trait-related deficits have been shown in verbal memory, sustained attention and executive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], as well as in social cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These cognitive deficits may not simply be side effects of the medical treatment but may also represent a core feature of the psychopathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It has been estimated that 30 to 60% of bipolar patients have trait-related cognitive deficits and that these reduce their occupational and social functioning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. There is an urgent clinical need for new treatment strategies that target cognitive enhancement in BD.</p><p>Cognitive remediation (CR) is a new psychological treatment, which aims to improve cognitive function, compensation and coping skills and, consequently, psychosocial function. It has been studied extensively in patients with schizophrenia: a recent meta-analysis of 40 studies demonstrated that CR leads to lasting improvement of cognitive and social function levels in this patient group (effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45; 95% confidence interval&#x02009;= 0.31 to 0.59) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Another meta-analysis of 16 studies of CR in mixed groups of patients with affective disorders, affective psychosis, schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders suggests that patients with BD can achieve beneficial effects of CR that are equivalent to those observed in patients with schizophrenia (effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.32; 95% confidence interval&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20 to 0.43) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Four of these studies included patients with affective disorders; of these, one study in unipolar disorder showed that memory improvement following CR was associated with increased occupational function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similarly, improved psychosocial and occupational functioning was found in a small, uncontrolled trial of 18 patients with BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and in a small, controlled trial with a mixed sample of patients with unipolar depression and BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] with large effect size; (partial <italic>&#x003b7;</italic><sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.45). Nevertheless, the studies included in the meta-analysis provide only preliminary evidence.</p><p>Recently, a multicentre randomized controlled trial (RCT) investigated the effects of functional remediation versus either psychoeducation or standard care on psychosocial function in euthymic patients with BD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Although patients in the functional remediation group showed functional improvement compared with those in standard care (with small effect size; <italic>d</italic>&#x02032;&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3), this was not significantly different from the improvement observed in the psychoeducation group. In addition, assessment of cognitive function revealed no beneficial effects of functional remediation over psychoeducation or standard care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this trial is, therefore, to investigate whether CR has beneficial effects on cognitive and psychosocial function in patients with fully or partially remitted BD who experience persistent cognitive difficulties. The rationale for inclusion of this remitted patient group is that their trait-related cognitive deficits are not successfully targeted by current treatments, as opposed to the state-related deficits in acute affective episodes, which may in some cases resolve fully with affective symptom reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Beneficial effects on trait-related cognitive deficits would hence point to future implementation of CR for remitted patients with BD, in order to facilitate these patients&#x02019; cognitive abilities and capacity to cope with education, work and everyday functioning.</p><sec><title>Hypotheses</title><p>The hypotheses of the present study are that CR, in comparison with standard treatment, will:</p><p>1. Enhance verbal memory (primary outcome), as measured with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) from baseline to week 12.</p><p>2. Improve sustained attention, executive function and psychosocial function (secondary outcomes), as measured with the Rapid Visual Information Processing, Part B of the Trail Making Test and Functional Assessment Short Test (FAST).</p><p>3. Improve additional measures of attention, executive function and facial expression recognition, as measured with a comprehensive neurocognitive test battery; and improve self-reported cognitive and psychosocial function, as measured with questionnaires.</p><sec><title><italic>Biomarkers of treatment effects</italic></title><p>In addition, we wish to investigate the following biomarkers of potential beneficial effects of CR on the outcome parameters: plasma levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), stress response, as reflected by morning awakening cortisol levels, and the neuroanatomical underpinnings of memory, attention, executive function and emotional processing. We hypothesize that potential beneficial effects of CR are associated with an increase in levels of plasma BDNF, a reduction in levels of morning awakening cortisol, or changes in the neuroanatomical underpinnings of memory, attention, executive function and emotional processing (see details under section 'Brain biomarkers of potential treatment effects&#x02019;), or a combination of these.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Patients will be randomized (1:1) to receive either CR in a group setting or standard treatment in an evaluator-blind between-groups design.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants and screening</title><p>Patients will mainly be recruited through the Copenhagen Affective Disorder Clinic, Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen, Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. The centre receives patients with complex affective disorders from the whole capital region. Patients will receive written information about the project and will be given the opportunity to ask questions before deciding whether to participate. Further information is available during the entire course of investigation from any of the researchers involved in the project. Patients will be screened with a medical check and a psychiatric interview using Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] to confirm diagnosis, and the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, (HDRS-17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] to determine the severity of depressive and manic symptoms.</p><p>We will recruit a minimum of 44 patients with the assumption of a 10% dropout rate, leaving us with 40 completers. We include patients with BD (as defined by ICD-10 diagnostic criteria), aged 18 to 50&#x000a0;years, who are in full or partial remission (defined as HDRS-17 and YMRS scores of &#x02264;14) and have subjective complaints of cognitive difficulties of moderate to severe degree (score of &#x02265;4) in at least two of seven cognitive domains on the Massachusetts General Hospital Cognitive and Physical Functioning Questionnaire [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Exclusion criteria are: current ECT-treatment, current substance or alcohol abuse, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or significant suicide risk. Patients are permitted to take antidepressants, lithium, antipsychotic medication and benzodiazepines corresponding to &#x0003c;22.5&#x000a0;mg Oxazepam daily.</p></sec><sec><title>Interventions</title><sec><title><italic>Cognitive remediation treatment</italic></title><p>Patients randomized to the CR group will receive CR in addition to standard treatment. A group of clinical psychologists at the Copenhagen Affective Disorder Clinic manualized the CR treatment. The CR programme is based on a treatment programme for patients with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], experience with cognitive rehabilitation in brain damage and thorough clinical and research-based knowledge of cognitive difficulties in BD. Before study initiation, we conducted a small pilot study, including six patients between September and December 2009, with the purpose of testing and revising the treatment manual and session structure and to define treatment length. The CR was then designed to consist of 12 weekly group sessions of two hours each, followed by a booster session four weeks after treatment completion. Groups include between five and eight patients and are run by two group therapists; a specialist in psychiatry with more than 20&#x000a0;years of clinical expertise with bipolar patients and a clinical psychologist trained in neuropsychology.</p><p>The programme has three main components: (1) psychoeducation and awareness of cognitive dysfunction in BD, including an emphasis on discovering each patient&#x02019;s individual profile of cognitive dysfunction; (2) training of compensatory and adaptive strategies in relation to cognitive dysfunction; and (3) computer-assisted cognitive training using RehaCom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The computerized exercises chosen for our intervention target attention and concentration, memory and learning, and executive function. Most exercises are highly ecologically valid as they focus on everyday life situations, thereby optimizing the translation from computer training to real-life cognitive demands, for example, planning activities, shopping for groceries, counting, memorizing short articles or memorizing people&#x02019;s faces and their names, job titles and phone numbers. The level of difficulty is automatically customized to each patient and increases as the patients&#x02019; performance improves. Furthermore, employing computer exercises as part of the treatment provides easily accessible homework and enables an individually tailored training programme to be created despite the group-based intervention.</p><p>A number of general principles for the CR sessions were established and are followed by the group therapists to facilitate learning: therapists will give brief lectures on a given topic without the use of PowerPoint slides, to minimize the strain on the patients&#x02019; divided attention. To account for the patients&#x02019; limited attention spans, the therapists are allowed to talk for a maximum of 5 to 10&#x000a0;minutes without patient involvement, after which patients are required to engage actively in the session. Each session consists of 120&#x000a0;minutes including a 15&#x000a0;minutes break. Homework, which practises attention, memory and executive function, consists of computer training, mindfulness exercises and reading a textbook about cognitive dysfunction in BD. Occasionally, the use of new compensatory and adaptive strategies will be included as part of the homework between sessions. Homework assignments will be discussed in each session along with planning of how the patient can most easily succeed in fulfilling the assignments at home. This includes planning the time of day and for how long each patient will read and complete the assigned computer tasks. For the homework reading tasks, each section of the book is assigned as homework twice, in order to facilitate the application of adaptive and compensatory strategies as well as to enhance the possibility of learning and remembering the contents.</p><p>The 12 sessions are divided into four main topics. The first two sessions consist of an introduction to cognitive function and dysfunction and to the principles of CR. In sessions three to five, attention and concentration are the main focus. An emphasis is placed on the importance of attention as a foundation for other areas of cognitive function, such as memory. The main elements in these sessions are psychoeducation on the variation in attentional function in BD, basic neuropsychological knowledge concerning various aspects of attentional function, computer training, and compensatory and adaptive strategies. Examples of such strategies for enhancing attentional function are reading with and without background music in order to discover what works best, allowing frequent breaks during attention straining tasks, such as setting an alarm when reading, and limiting oneself to carry out one task at a time rather than attempt to multitask a number of activities or initiate new activities before other activities are completed. Finally, therapists train patients in mindfulness meditation as a means to enhance attentional capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and in subsequent sessions, a brief mindfulness meditation will be carried out at the beginning of each session.</p><p>Sessions six to eight address memory and learning. During these sessions, various exercises on remembering visual and auditory verbal input are performed. These exercises include a reading task where patients are handed a brief newspaper article on a relevant topic ten minutes before the 15&#x000a0;minutes break during a session. The timing is chosen to ensure a small time gap between encoding and recall of the content of the article. Patients are asked to read the article with the intention of giving a brief resume in front of the rest of the group after the break. Before commencing the task, we refresh memory techniques, such as reading aloud, taking brief notes and using visual imagery in order to remember key points. Another exercise is a conversational task, also carried out just before the 15&#x000a0;minutes break during sessions. In this exercise, patients work in pairs; one of them pretending to be a close friend or relative and the other asking questions to get to know this person. Again, following the 15&#x000a0;minutes break they are asked to tell the rest of the group about the person they had 'interviewed&#x02019;. The idea of pretending to be another person is to ensure that the listening patient does not have prior knowledge of the conversation partner.</p><p>Brief talks are given on various aspects of memory, such as long-term versus short-term memory and working memory, and verbal versus visuospatial memory. An introduction to establishing structure in everyday life is followed by homework on this topic. Homework includes establishing a routine of using only one calendar or diary, whether it is an electronic version or a traditional paper version, rather than several, which may cause confusion. Furthermore, patients are instructed in efficient use of a diary or calendar by including all appointments plus time for rest and physical exercise, grocery shopping, and so on. Possible cognitive side effects of medication and substance abuse are discussed.</p><p>Sessions 9 to 12 are dedicated to executive function in everyday life. Thorough discussions of where executive dysfunction arises provide a foundation for individualized homework assignments in order to improve these areas of functioning. In the sessions, we carry out troubleshooting as a group-based exercise. One patient mentions a problem, such as being incapable of cooking a meal or always being late for appointment and feeling stressed as a result. With thorough guidance from the group therapists, we break down the problem into as many subcomponents as possible and try to conjure up new and creative solutions to try out as homework in between sessions. The homework assignments are followed up in great detail. Also, at this point in the treatment programme, reading of fiction as cognitive training of attention and verbal memory is introduced. Each patient is encouraged to choose a book as a homework assignment and a detailed plan for the reading process is established. An emphasis is placed on making the treatment programme as individualized as possible.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Standard treatment group</italic></title><p>Patients in the control group receive standard treatment consisting of the standard out-patient mental health services routines in the capital region of Denmark either at the Copenhagen Affective Disorder Clinic, community psychiatric centres or private specialists in psychiatry. Standard treatment involves psychopharmacological mood stabilization and relapse prevention and, in our clinic and most community psychiatric centres, psychoeducation. In contrast to the intervention group, standard treatment does not involve any specific cognitive training.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Pharma Consulting Group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] performed the randomization of the patients with stratification for age (&#x0003c;35&#x000a0;years) and years of education (&#x0003c;15&#x000a0;years).</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>Study personnel involved in the evaluation of outcomes are blinded to treatment allocation.

We hypothesize that the CR group compared with the standard treatment group will (1) increase memory-related activation in medial temporal regions including the hippocampus and that this will correlated with memory performance; (2) enhance neural response in a fronto-parietal network during the 2-back task, which is associated with improved executive function; and (3) modulate neural responses to emotional faces in a fronto-limbic circuitry, which is accompanied by improved facial expression recognition. In addition, we will explore whether CR induces changes in hippocampus structure, white matter fibre structure and brain connectivity.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Imaging data analysis</italic></title><p>Both fMRI and MRI data are collected with a Siemens Trio scanner operating at 3.0&#x000a0;T at the Danish Research Centre for Magnetic Resonance, Hvidovre Hospital, Denmark. Image analysis is carried out using tools from FMRIB Software Library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. BET is used for brain extraction of the T1-weighted images and FLIRT is used to perform affine alignment of the diffusion and T1-weighted images. The FIRST tool, which is part of FMRIB&#x02019;s Software Library version 5.0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], is used to segment the hippocampus automatically for analyses of changes in volume and shape.

Pearson&#x02019;s coefficients are calculated to determine the relationship between MRI changes and neuropsychological improvements.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size and power calculation</title><p>Test sample and statistical power is calculated by nQuery Advisor 5.0 software. The primary outcome is a change in verbal memory measured with RAVLT from baseline to week 12 between CR and standard treatment groups. A recent study demonstrated that the average California Verbal Learning Test (a verbal learning test equivalent to the RAVLT) total recall score for patients with remitted BD is 52.0, whilst the score for healthy age-matched control subjects was 60.7 (out of a maximum 75) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Based on this, we would expect a clinically relevant difference in the change between groups to be at least 4 points in RAVLT total recall. Assuming an average RAVLT total recall score of 56 subsequent to CR and 52 (that is, a difference in the change of 4 points) subsequent to standard treatment and a standard deviation of 4 points for both groups, a sample size of <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40 patients (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;20 per group) will achieve a statistical power of 86% to demonstrate a clinically relevant verbal memory improvement with CR versus standard treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses of primary, secondary and tertiary outcomes</title><p>To investigate the effects of CR versus standard treatment from baseline to week 12 (primary outcome assessment time), we will use repeated measures analysis of covariance with adjustment for stratification variables, and with and without adjustment for mood changes from baseline to week 12.

Data from patients with schizophrenia and preliminary results from small exploratory studies in mixed groups of patients with affective disorders suggest beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], although a recent study of functional remediation in BD showed no significant effect on cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The present trial therefore serves to meet the clinical need for more specific and thorough investigations of the effects of CR on patients&#x02019; cognitive function.</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>CR in a group setting has been investigated in only a few studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and it is unclear whether group therapy is less appealing than individual therapy for patients with cognitive difficulties. It is, however, our experience from the pilot study and patient feedback from the present trial that patients benefit from group-based training; it is often easier for patients to acknowledge and accept their own cognitive difficulties and to learn to cope with them when they are aware of other patient&#x02019;s problems and improvements. Another limitation is that it is unclear how many training sessions are optimal for bipolar patients with cognitive dysfunction. In an uncontrolled study by Deckersbach <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], 14 individual sessions of CR were provided and results showed lower residual symptoms and increased occupational and overall psychosocial functioning in patients with BD. Moreover, improvements in executive functioning were associated with improved occupational functioning. Studies of patients with schizophrenia have typically included an average treatment length of 32.2&#x000a0;hours (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;4 to 130&#x000a0;hours), provided over 16.7&#x000a0;weeks (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;2 to 104&#x000a0;weeks) with a therapy intensity of 2.2 sessions per week (range&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.6 to 5 sessions per week) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>We chose to provide 12&#x02009;+&#x02009;1 sessions based on the experience from our pilot study that this length is sufficient for improvement in most patients. However, if this first exploratory study finds an effect of CR on cognition, future studies are warranted to explore the optimal length of treatment and frequency of CR sessions. Finally, the choice of a good control group is often complicated in psychological intervention studies. We chose to compare CR as an add-on to standard treatment with standard treatment alone. With such a design we cannot be sure that a potential beneficial effect of the active intervention is due specifically to the CR program or to an unspecific effect of solely taking part in group sessions. Colom <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] used an elegant, if time- and resource-consuming, design by comparing group psychoeducation with unspecific group intervention in their seminal paper aiming to detect the specific effects of psychoeducation. It can be argued whether the interaction between patients in the unspecific group intervention is comparable to part of the CR treatment. Using our design, the entire combined effect of CR and group sessions, including the interaction with other patients with similar problems in group sessions, is investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Advantages</title><p>RAVLT was chosen as the primary outcome measure for the following reasons: (a) remitted patients with BD show deficits on this test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]; (b) it is a standardized, internationally accepted and valid test of verbal memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]; (c) there is a high correlation between verbal memory and psychosocial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>], which makes it clinically relevant; and (d) other RCTs have found significant effects of CR on verbal memory in patients with schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. However, there is also consistent evidence for trait-related deficits in sustained attention in BD and negative effects of this on psychosocial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In addition, CR has been shown to improve attention in schizophrenia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>] and unipolar disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and both verbal memory and sustained attention are addressed in our CR programme. Therefore, the priority of verbal memory over sustained attention as the primary outcome may be somewhat arbitrary.</p><p>The study has a naturalistic approach with few exclusion criteria. Patients should have BD, should be in complete or partial remission and should self-report cognitive difficulties. To make treatment with CR meaningful, patients with current substance or alcohol abuse or significant suicide risk are excluded but standard psychopharmacological treatment is allowed. Consequently, if CR is found to produce beneficial effects, the intervention can be implemented to treat all bipolar patients in complete or partial remission with subjective complaints of cognitive difficulties. We expect a high patient acceptance and adherence as the CR program is easy to follow and not too time consuming and also because of the supportive positive effects from the group setting in itself. From a feasibility perspective, the intervention is relatively inexpensive as two therapists in our affective disorder clinic deliver the group sessions. Although the CR intervention is standardized according to a manual and the computer training software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] it is likely that treatment with CR is best offered in specialized affective disorder clinics with expertise within pharmacological and psychological treatment of BD.</p></sec><sec><title>Perspectives</title><p>If CR proves effective, it can easily be implemented in future treatment of BD to facilitate patients&#x02019; cognitive function and thereby potentially improve their psychosocial function.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>Patient enrolment started in September 2011 and is ongoing until a minimum 40 patients have completed assessment at week 12 (primary outcome assessment time).</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BD: Bipolar disorder; BDNF: Brain derived neurotrophic factor; CR: Cognitive remediation; FAST: Functional Assessment Short Test; fMRI: Functional magnetic resonance imaging; HDRS-17: 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging; RAVLT: Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; YMRS: Young Mania Rating Scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>LVK has been a consultant for Lundbeck and AstraZenica within the last three years.

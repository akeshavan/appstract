However, the importance of IL-17 in MS is still under debate, and other TH17-associated cytokines are likely more crucial in the initiation and maintenance of neuroinflammation.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this study, we addressed the function of IL-26 and its role as TH17-associated cytokine in blood brain barrier (BBB) breakdown and neuroinflammation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> To establish that IL-26 is a TH17-associated cytokine, qPCR for IL-26 and established TH17 markers was performed on differentiated TH17 cells. The expression of IL-26 was confirmed by western blot (WB) and immunohistofluorescence (IHF). ELISA was used to determine expression of IL-26 in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients and controls, and to analyze supernatant of human blood brain barrier endothelial cells (BBB-ECs) after IL-26 treatment. Expression of the IL-26R (IL-10Rbeta/IL-20Ralpha) and tight junction proteins on BBB-ECs was analyzed using WB and IHF. Permeability of BBB-EC monolayers after IL-26 treatment was assessed using dextran and BSA diffusion assays. In vivo permeability after i.p. IL-26 treatment of C57Bl/6 mice was assessed by IHF (Evans Blue, fibrinogen and ICAM-1) and 2-photon microscopy (fluorescent dextran).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We demonstrate that IL-26 is specifically produced by human TH17 lymphocytes and that it correlates strongly to other TH17-associated markers. IL-26 is increased in the serum and CSF of untreated MS patients, as compared to controls or to treated MS patients. Human BBB-ECs express a functional IL-26R both in vitro and in situ, since they respond to IL-26 treatment by secreting IL-8 and IP-10. IL-26 treatment of BBB-EC monolayers increases their permeability and decreases expression of the tight junction molecule occludin. In vivo, IL-26 treatment increases Evans Blue extravasation in the CNS. Furthermore, we find a significant perivascular accumulation of fibrinogen 2 to 8 hours after IL-26 injection, an upregulation of ICAM-1 on the surface of BBB-ECs, and perivascular accumulation of immune cells in the CNS. This was confirmed by in vivo two-photon microscopy, showing leakage of fluorescent dextran after injection of IL-26.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Taken together, these data strongly suggest that IL-26 i) is a TH17-associated cytokine, ii) is correlated to MS disease activity and iii) increases BBB permeability and transmigration of TH lymphocytes, and possibly other immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="section4-1352458514546076"><title>YI1.2 DICAM: a novel molecular effector in neuroinflammation</title><p><underline>S Ghannam</underline><sup>1</sup>, J Alvarez<sup>2</sup>, H Kebir<sup>2</sup>, L Bourbonniere<sup>1</sup>, A Prat<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>CRCHUM, Neuroimmunology, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>CRCHUM, Montreal, QC, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> TH17 lymphocytes, are important contributors of multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion formation. Pathogenic TH17 lymphocytes express pro-inflammatory cytokines and factors and are known to migrate more readily across CNS barrier, including the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We performed proteomic profiling of human TH17 lymphocytes, and compared it to TH1 and TH2 lymphocytes. We found that <underline>D</underline>ual <underline>I</underline>g domain containing <underline>C</underline>ell <underline>A</underline>dhesion <underline>M</underline>olecule (DICAM) is specifically up-regulated in TH17 lymphocytes. DICAM is a new member of the immunoglobulin superfamily known to interact with avb3 integrin expressed by endothelial cells (ECs).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> While expression and function of DICAM in autoimmune neuroinflammation remains unexplored. In the current study, we sought to evaluate the role of DICAM in CNS inflammation, in the migration of encephalitogenic TH17 lymphocytes to the CNS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> To identify expression of DICAM, we used qPCR and flow cytometry of differentiated TH1 and TH2 and TH17 lymphocytes and on different subset of human immune cells, using blood from healthy donors and MS patients. By immunohistochemistry, we evaluated DICAM expression by using our large collection of CNS material collected from EAE animals, MS patients and controls.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We demonstrated that DICAM is mainly expressed by TH17 lymphocytes. We showed that the expression of DICAM is strongly associated with expression of ROR-&#x003b3;, IL-23R, IL-17, IL-22, GM-CSF and GZMB expression in human CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes, and to a lesser extent with T<sub>H</sub>1 CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes. DICAM was not expressed by CD19<sup>+</sup> B lymphocytes, CD14<sup>+</sup> monocytes or CD83<sup>+</sup> Dendritic cells. These data are the first to demonstrate that DICAM is specifically expressed on the surface of potentially encephalitogenic TH17 lymphocytes and that expression of DICAM is regulated by IL-23, IL-1 and IL-6, cytokines which are involved in CNS autoimmune diseases. Confocal microscopy of MS brain lesions revealed the presence of DICAM-expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in active demyelinating lesions and in some early pre-active lesions. DICAM-expressing cells were found to co-express IL-17. Finally, qPCR analysis of DICAM expression in CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes collected from the blood of MS patients revealed a significant up-regulation of DICAM in untreated RRMS patients, as compared to healthy donors.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data are in strong support of the role that DICAM could play in the transmigration and the recruitment of TH17 lymphocytes across CNS vascular barriers.</p></sec><sec id="section5-1352458514546076"><title>YI1.3 Clinical disease burden predicts myelin water fraction in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>E Monohan</underline><sup>1</sup>, SM Hurtado R&#x000fa;a<sup>2</sup>, K Fujimoto<sup>1</sup>, S Pandya<sup>3</sup>, EM LoCastro<sup>3</sup>, M Dayan<sup>3</sup>, J Perumal<sup>1,4</sup>, N Nealon<sup>1</sup>, T Vartanian<sup>1,4</sup>, TD Nguyen<sup>3</sup>, A Raj<sup>3</sup>, SA Gauthier<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, Department of Neurology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, Department of Public Health, New York, NY, United States, <sup>3</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, Department of Radiology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>4</sup>Weill Cornell Medical College, Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> An imaging marker that can accurately and specifically ascertain myelin content is essential to investigate myelin variability within lesions and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) and to explore predictors of these differences among MS patients. T2 relaxometry is an MRI technique in which the contribution of water associated with myelin can be represented as myelin water fraction (MWF).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this study we applied our fast whole brain T2 acquisition (T2prep SPIRAL) to a large cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and investigated the distribution and predictors of MWF.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> One hundred and forty one MS patients and 10 age-matched healthy controls (HC&#x02019;s) had T2prep 3D SPIRAL sequence acquired. The SPIRAL data was analyzed with a spatially constrained multi-Gaussian post-processing algorithm to create MWF maps. For each patient, the distribution of MWF values was modeled using a mixture of two gamma distributions. Multi-variate linear regression models were utilized to predict white matter MWF distribution.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Among all patients, the mean NAWM MWF (0.12 &#x000b1; 0.05) was significantly higher compared to lesion MWF (0.05 &#x000b1; 0.05), p &#x02248; 0 in a voxel-based analysis. Individual whole brain white matter MWF in patients was modeled and followed a bi-model modeled distribution (94%) as compared to HC&#x02019;s (10%). The strongest predictive model (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> = 0.89, p&#x0003c; 2.2 x 10<sup>-16</sup>) revealed a significant association with increasing EDSS (p = 3.84 x 10<sup>-5</sup>) and longer disease duration (p = 0.0122) with lower MWF values in lower curve of the bi-model distribution.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Through our technique, we efficiently assessed whole brain white matter MWF in a large cohort of MS patients. The distribution of white matter MWF follows a bi-model distribution, likely reflecting lesion and NAWM. Increasing clinical burden of disease predicts lower MWF values which suggests a progressive loss of myelin with accumulating disease. Our results represent one of the first quantitative studies characterizing the distribution of whole brain white matter MWF distribution, and relating these measures to clinical disease burden. Importantly, we have identified factors that may potentially contribute to lower WM myelin values; these variables and potentially others will need to be considered when designing remyelination treatment trials.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1352458514546076"><title>YI1.4 <italic>In vivo</italic> 7T MRI characterization of leptomeningeal enhancement in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>L Vuolo</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, P Sati<sup>1</sup>, M Absinta<sup>1,3</sup>, I Cortese<sup>4</sup>, DS Reich<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Translational Neuroradiology Unit, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Florence, Departments of Neurology and Radiology, Florence, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Milan, Italy, <sup>4</sup>National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), Bethesda, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Leptomeningeal inflammation has been described and pathologically documented in multiple sclerosis (MS). Typically, clusters of inflammatory cells in the cerebral leptomeninges are closely associated with meningeal vessels. Within the subarachnoid space, focal gadolinium (gad)-enhancement on T2-FLAIR 3T MRI has recently been recognized to be a potential in vivo marker of leptomeningeal inflammation in MS. However, the structural correlates of this enhancement have remained elusive, probably due to the small dimensions of the inflammatory clusters.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Structural in vivo characterization of leptomeningeal enhancement (LME) in multiple sclerosis (MS) via 7 tesla (7T) MRI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> On a 7T MRI system, we studied 7 cases with known LME based on prior 3T scans. We acquired whole-brain 3D T2-FLAIR and T1-weighted magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (T1-MPRAGE) scans, as well as high-resolution multislice gradient-echo scans providing T2* contrast (voxel size=0.2x0.2x1 mm) and acquired in two planes. Sequences were repeated before and after injection of 0.1 mmol/kg of gadolinium contrast.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> In all cases, LME was stable since the 3T scan and was clearly detectable on post-gad T2-FLAIR. In all cases, LME was seen to be closely related to one or more meningeal vessels, which were clearly depicted on the T2* sequence. Despite the high spatial- resolution scans, no structural finding was found. However, after gad injection, focal bright signal strictly adjacent to a vessel was seen on both T2-FLAIR and T2*. This finding is compatible with leakage of gad from this vessel, with subsequent local flow within the CSF near the vessel. Repetition of the T2-FLAIR scan over the first hour following gad injection demonstrated that the shape and size of the enhancing focus remained constrained.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> No soft-tissue correlates of LME in MS are seen even on high-resolution 7T MRI scans. However, images acquired post gad suggest that LME detected on T2-FLAIR MRI is probably due to focal opening of the blood-CSF barrier. In visualized foci, spread of gad is limited in space, perhaps by an inflammatory scar. Our findings remain consistent with the pathological description of organized meningeal inflammation described in MS.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1352458514546076"><title>YI1.5 Multiple sclerosis deep grey matter: the relation between demyelination, neurodegeneration, inflammation and iron</title><p><underline>JM Frischer</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Haider<sup>1</sup>, C Simeonidou<sup>2</sup>, G Steinberger<sup>1</sup>, S Hametner<sup>1</sup>, N Grigoriadis<sup>2</sup>, G Deretzi<sup>2</sup>, GG Kovacs<sup>3</sup>, A Kutzelnigg<sup>1</sup>, H Lassmann<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical University Vienna, Center for Brain Research, Vienna, Austria, <sup>2</sup>Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Thessaloniki, Greece, <sup>3</sup>Medical University Vienna, Institute of Neurology, Vienna, Austria</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In Multiple Sclerosis, diffuse degenerative processes in the deep grey matter have been associated with clinical disabilities.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Our aim was to analyze DGM pathology in MS patients with a focus on the incidence and topographical distribution of lesions, their relationship to inflammation, and the underlying mechanisms of demyelination and neurodegeneration.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We performed a systematic study on a total sample of 75 MS autopsy patients and twelve controls. In addition, detailed analyses of inflammation, acute axonal injury, iron deposition, and oxidative stress were performed on a subsample of MS and control patients.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> MS deep grey matter was affected by two different processes: the formation of focal demyelinating lesions and diffuse neurodegeneration. Deep grey matter demyelination was most prominent in the caudate nucleus and hypothalamus and could already be seen in early MS stages. Lesions developed on the background of inflammation. Deep grey matter inflammation was intermediate between low inflammatory cortical lesions and active white matter lesions. Demyelination and neurodegeneration were associated with oxidative injury. Iron was stored primarily within oligodendrocytes and myelin fibres and released upon demyelination. In addition to focal demyelinated plaques, the MS deep grey matter also showed diffuse and global neurodegeneration. This was reflected by a global reduction of neuronal density, the presence of acutely injured axons, and the accumulation of oxidised phospholipids and deoxyribonucleic acid in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and axons. Neurodegeneration was associated with T-cell infiltration, expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase in microglia, and profound accumulation of iron.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In conclusion, we show that the DGM is profoundly involved in the disease progression of MS patients and appears to contribute significantly to the global accumulation of disability in MS patients. In addition to focal demyelination, a diffuse neurodegenerative process occurs in the DGM and is associated with clinical disability. This process may be related to increased oxidative injury and anterograde or retrograde degeneration in a brain area with exceptionally high iron content.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1352458514546076"><title>YI1.6 Regional thalamic damage and cognitive impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis: a multicenter study</title><p><underline>A Bisecco</underline><sup>1</sup>, MA Rocca<sup>1,2</sup>, E Pagani<sup>1</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>3</sup>, N Muhlert<sup>4</sup>, N De Stefano<sup>5</sup>, C Enzinger<sup>6</sup>, A Gallo<sup>7</sup>, HE Hulst<sup>3</sup>, K Abdel-Aziz<sup>4</sup>, ML Stromillo<sup>5</sup>, F Fazekas<sup>6</sup>, G Tedeschi<sup>7</sup>, G Comi<sup>2</sup>, M Filippi<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Milan, Italy, <sup>2</sup>San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Department of Neurology, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>VU Medical Centre, Radiology and Image Analysis Centre (IAC), Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>4</sup>Institute of Neurology, UCL, NMR Research Unit, London, United Kingdom, <sup>5</sup>University of Siena, Dept. of Medicine, Surgery &#x00026; Neuroscience, Siena, Italy, <sup>6</sup>Medical University of Graz, Department of Neurology, Graz, Austria, <sup>7</sup>Second University of Naples, Department of Neurology, Naples, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Cognitive impairment affects a large proportion of MS patients and has been related to atrophy and diffusivity abnormalities of the thalamus.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> In this multicenter study, we explored the contribution of regional thalamic structural connectivity abnormalities to cognitive impairment in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Brain dual-echo, 3D T1-weighted, and diffusion tensor (DT) MRI sequences were collected from 52 relapsing-remitting MS patients and 57 healthy controls (HC) from six European centers. RAO&#x02019;s neuropsychological battery and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test were assessed. Patients with &#x02a7e;2 abnormal neuropsychological tests were considered cognitively impaired (CI). Thalamic subdivision in connectivity defined regions (CDRs) according to cortical projections was performed using Diffusion Tractography-Based Parcellation. Selected target regions were: frontal (F), motor (M), post-central (PC), posterior parietal (PP), temporal (T) and occipital (O) regions. A probabilistic atlas of CDRs was created from HC images and applied to all subjects to derive average values of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Between-group differences of global and CDRs thalamic FA/MD values, adjusted for centre, were investigated. Correlations between FA/MD values with global and specific cognitive Z scores were also assessed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-two (43%) MS patients were CI. Compared to HCs, MS patients had: 1) reduced thalamic volume, bilaterally (p&#x0003c; 0.0001); 2) increased FA of the bilateral (B) global thalamus, B F-CDRs, B M-CDRs and B O-CDRs (0.003&#x0003c; p&#x0003c; 0.04); 3) decreased FA of B T-CDRs (0.0001&#x0003c; p&#x0003c; 0.008); 4) increased MD of B F-CDR, B T-CDR and B O-CDRs (0.0001&#x0003c; p&#x0003c; 0.009). Compared to cognitively preserved patients, CI patients had: 1) reduced B thalamic volumes (p&#x0003c; 0.0001); 2) increased FA of B global thalamus and left F-CDRs, B M-CDRs, B PC-CDRs and B O-CDRs (0.0004&#x0003c; p&#x0003c; 0.05); 3) increased MD of left PC-CDRs, B T-CDRs and B O-CDRs (0.03&#x0003c; p&#x0003c; 0.002). Significant correlations were found between global/specific cognitive Z scores and thalamic volumetric and diffusivity abnormalities.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Thalamic involvement in MS is a result of a complex balance between damage to the gray matter (GM) (as detected by increased FA) and white matter (WM) (as detected by reduced FA), with a different distribution in thalamic subregions. The involvement of GM in anterior (F-/M-areas connected) and lateral (P-/O-areas connected) thalamic subregions contributes to cognitive impairment in these patients.</p></sec><sec id="section9-1352458514546076"><title>YI1.7 Changes in thalamic resting-state functional connectivity induced by a home-based cognitive rehabilitation program in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>L De Giglio</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Tona<sup>1</sup>, N Petsas<sup>1</sup>, F De Luca<sup>1</sup>, L Prosperini<sup>1</sup>, C Pozzilli<sup>1</sup>, P Pantano<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Mechanisms underlying cognitive dysfunction and recovery in Multiple sclerosis (MS) are still matter of debate. Recently we demonstrated that thalamic Resting State Network (RSN) is disrupted in MS and that decreased performance in cognitive tests is associated with alteration of thalamo-cortical functional connectivity (FC) (Tona et al. Radiology 2014).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The aim of the present study is to investigate with resting state (RS) fMRI changes in thalamic connectivity induced by cognitive rehabilitation (CR). For this purpose we used the videogame &#x0201c;Dr. Kawashima Brain Training&#x0201d; (DKBT, Nintendo, Japan), which we have recently shown to be effective in improving attention, processing speed and working memory in patients with MS (De Giglio et al. ECTRIMS 2013)</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> This was a randomised, wait-list control study. MS patients with failure of at least one between Stroop Test (ST), Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT), Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), were submitted to an 8-week home-based CR program playing DKBT. They underwent clinical evaluation and 3Tesla RS-fMRI at baseline (T0) and after CR (T1). FMRI data were analyzed using a seed-based method to identify the thalamic RSN. Between-group analysis of RSN changes at T1 was performed using a two-sample t-test model (unpaired, cluster level p&#x0003c; 0.05, FWE corrected) with the FSL software. Clinical variables were entered into a one-sample model to calculate correlations with FC in the patient group (cluster level p&#x0003c; 0.05, FWE corrected).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Twenty-four patients were randomly assigned to either intervention group (n=12) or control group (n=12). We found a significant effect of DKBT on PASAT (F=6.616, p=0.018) and ST (F=5.325, p=0.030). At T1, thalamo-cortical FC showed significant different patterns in the intervention group when compared with controls. Moreover we observed that an improvement in PASAT and ST scores after intervention was related with an increased thalamic FC in specific brain areas.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Our study underlines the relevance of thalamic regulation of the brain networks involved in cognitive processes. We suggest that thalamic FC modifications may be considered as a functional substrate for clinical improvement induced by cognitive rehabilitation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section10-1352458514546076"><title>YI2 - Young Investigators 2</title><sec id="section11-1352458514546076"><title>YI2.1 Is focal leptomeningeal enhancement an in vivo imaging biomarker for meningeal inflammation?</title><p><underline>M Absinta</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, L Vuolo<sup>1</sup>, G Nair<sup>1</sup>, P Sati<sup>1</sup>, M Dragan<sup>3</sup>, MI Reyes-Mantilla<sup>4</sup>, M Filippi<sup>2</sup>, PA Calabresi<sup>4</sup>, CA Pardo<sup>4</sup>, DS Reich<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Translational Neuroradiology Unit, National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>Neuroimaging Research Unit, Institute of Experimental Neurology, Division of Neuroscience, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Flow Cytometry Core Facility, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>4</sup>Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Meningeal inflammation might contribute to myelin-specific immunological response and supial cortical injury in MS. A spectrum of meningeal pathological findings, typically varying degrees of inflammatory cell clustering, has been described, however a validated imaging correlate is lacking. Recently, our lab has identified stable foci of leptomeningeal enhancement on post-Gad T2-FLAIR scans in 33% of progressive MS patients.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate the histopathological correlate of in vivo leptomeningeal enhancement and its spatial relationship with demyelinated cortical lesions in the formalin-fixed brain of two progressive MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Accurate in vivo 3T and postmortem 7T MRI-guided pathology to the targets was achieved using an individualized, MRI-designed and 3D-printed cutting box for fixed brains. Ten-&#x000b5;m cryosections were stained for H&#x00026;E and LFB-PAS and compared with the 7T postmortem MRI from the same location. Immunohistochemistry was performed with a multiplex of primary antibodies (including CD45, CD3, CD8, CD68, IBA1, myelin/PLP, fibrinogen, MAP2, DAPI) on representative sections.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Four foci of meningeal enhancement were detected on longitudinal post-Gad FLAIR scans in these patients. These foci were located in cerebral sulci affected by demyelinated cortical lesions as seen on the postmortem 7T MRI and confirmed with myelin/PLP immunofluorescence. Diffuse leptomeningeal perivascular inflammation (including CD8 T cells, B cells, and macrophages) was detected in the meninges where in vivo meningeal enhancement was discovered. Two sulci, negative for in vivo meningeal enhancement, did not show perivascular clusters of inflammatory cells, regardless of the presence of cortical pathology.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> In vivo focal leptomeningeal enhancement is a marker of perivascular meningeal inflammation, which is prevalent in MS. The perivascular nature of this inflammation, and in particular its association with abnormal vascular permeability, suggests that there is persistent communication between peripheral and central nervous system immunity, even in progressive MS. Improvement in subpial cortical lesion detection in vivo, investigation of the effect of anti-inflammatory therapies on enhancement, and additional characterization of enhancing and nonenhancing foci of leptomeningeal inflammation, might help further elucidate the pathophysiological relevance.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1352458514546076"><title>YI2.2 Retinal measures reflect global neurodegeneration and inflammation; a 4-year longitudinal study of optical coherence tomography and MRI in MS</title><p><underline>S Saidha</underline><sup>1</sup>, O Omar Al-Louzi<sup>1</sup>, J Ratchford<sup>1</sup>, P Bhargava<sup>1</sup>, J Oh<sup>1</sup>, S Newsome<sup>1</sup>, J Prince<sup>2</sup>, D Pham<sup>3</sup>, S Roy<sup>3</sup>, P Van Zijl<sup>4</sup>, L Balcer<sup>5</sup>, E Frohman<sup>6</sup>, D Reich<sup>7</sup>, C Crainiceanu<sup>8</sup>, P Calabresi<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Dept of Neurology, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering &#x00026; Dept of Computer Science, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>3</sup>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Dept of Electrical and Computer Engineering &#x00026; Dept of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>4</sup>Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Dept of Radiology and Radiological Sciences, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>5</sup>New York University Langone Medical Center, Dept of Neurology, New York, NY, United States, <sup>6</sup>University of Texas Southwestern, Dept of Neurology and Ophthalmology, Dallas, TX, United States, <sup>7</sup>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, Translational Neuroradiology Unit, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>8</sup>Johns Hopkins University, Dept of Biostatistics, Baltimore, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Optical coherence tomography (OCT) segmentation derived ganglion cell layer+inner plexiform layer (GCIP) thickness has superior structure-function relationships than conventional peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RFNL) thickness in MS. Although RNFL and GCIP thicknesses correlate with whole brain volume cross-sectionally in MS, it is unclear whether atrophy within retinal and brain compartments are related longitudinally. Baseline inner nuclear layer (INL) thickness might predict inflammatory activity, but how these relate over time is unknown.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine whether atrophy of specific retinal structures is associated with atrophy of specific brain sub-structures and accumulation of lesions in MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Cirrus-HD OCT (with automated segmentation) and clinical testing was performed in 107 MS patients bi-annually (mean follow-up: 42-months). MRI brain scans (3T) were performed annually (mean follow-up: 35 months). Brain sub-structure volumes were determined using Lesion-TOADS. Linear regression was used to estimate individual-specific rates of change in retinal and brain-subcompartment measures. These rates were correlated, adjusting for age, sex, disease duration, and optic neuritis history. The impact of measurement error was assessed using the simulation-extrapolation method.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> GCIP atrophy rate and rates of whole brain (r=0.41, p&#x0003c; 0.001), gray matter (GM; r=0.34, p&#x0003c; 0.001), white matter (WM; r=0.26, p=0.007) and thalamic (r=0.36, p&#x0003c; 0.001) atrophy over time were associated. RNFL atrophy rate was less robustly associated with whole brain (r=0.29, p=0.003), GM (r=0.25, p=0.01), and thalamic atrophy (r=0.33, p&#x0003c; 0.001) rates. GCIP and whole brain atrophy rates were more strongly associated in secondary progressive MS (r=0.74) and primary progressive MS (r=0.44), than relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS; r=0.30). Similar trends according to MS subtype were observed between rates of GCIP, GM and WM atrophy. In RRMS, lesion accumulation rate was associated with rates of GCIP (r=&#x02212;0.30, p=0.01) and INL (r=&#x02212;0.28, p=0.02) atrophy.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Retinal changes mirror global central nervous system processes in MS. GCIP atrophy reflects whole brain, and in particular GM atrophy, especially in progressive MS. Beyond gleaning information regarding neurodegeneration, tracking OCT provides insight regarding inflammatory activity in RRMS, with perhaps the INL being most useful for this purpose. Our findings validate OCT measures, both for clinical monitoring and as an outcome in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="section13-1352458514546076"><title>YI2.3 A comparison of cognitive performances between multiple sclerosis patients with pediatric- versus adult-onset disease</title><p><underline>B Hakiki</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Niccolai<sup>1</sup>, E Portaccio<sup>1</sup>, B Goretti<sup>1</sup>, M Giannini<sup>1</sup>, L Past&#x000f2;<sup>1</sup>, C Pecori<sup>1</sup>, ML Stromillo<sup>2</sup>, A Giorgio<sup>2</sup>, F Rossi<sup>2</sup>, N De stefano<sup>2</sup>, MP Amato<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Florence, Department NEUROFARBA, Section Neurosciences, Florence, Italy, <sup>2</sup>University of Siena, Department of Medicine, Surgery and Neuroscience, Siena, Italy</p><p><bold>Background: t</bold>here is limited information on cognitive impairment (CI) in pediatric-onset MS (POMS) which represents 3-5% of the whole MS population.

OCT has become increasingly used in demyelinating diseases. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) becomes thinned most dramatically after optic neuritis (ON) but also during the course of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the absence of ON. Multiple studies have shown a strong correlation between OCT measurements and both high and low contrast visual acuity. A RNFL threshold of 75&#x000b5;m has been demonstrated to predict persistent visual dysfunction. While the utility of OCT in adults has been well-established with consistent correlation with outcomes not only of visual acuity but also with MRI disease burden and disability, these measures have not yet been well-established in children.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To highlight a subset of pediatric patients with optic nerve damage but retained visual acuity.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Visual acuity and OCT data were collected from patients referred to the Pediatric Demyelinating Disease Clinic at Children&#x02019;s Medical Center in Dallas, TX. These data were collected from 190 right eyes (OD) and 188 left eyes (OS) from 2009 to 2014. Each RNFL was compared to its high contrast visual acuity (100%VA) and its low contrast visual acuity (2.5%VA).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 256 eyes with RNFL measuring 85-110&#x000b5;m, 175 eyes (87 OD, 88 OS) had 2.5%VA&#x0003e;=25 (average=35; range=25-50), with a corresponding 100%VA average of 59 (range=23-70). Of the 97 eyes with RNFL&#x0003c; 75&#x000b5;m (range=55-73&#x000b5;m), 23 eyes (10 OD, 13 OS) had 2.5%VA&#x0003e;=25 (average=33; range=25-45), with a corresponding 100%VA average of 57 (range=49-63). Of note, 9 of the eyes had RNFL measuring 55-59&#x000b5;m and had an average 2.5%VA of 36 (range=30-45) and an average 100% VA of 56 (range=50-63).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> There is a clear subset of pediatric demyelinating disease patients with significant RNFL damage who have both high and low contrast visual acuities similar to patients with normal RNFL values. This appears unique from studies in adults but it is unclear as to why this occurs in some children. Other variables should be analyzed including patient age and sex, time to treatment, and type of treatment to see if there is any significant correlation between these factors and retained visual acuity. Understanding how cases such as these recover from optic nerve damage could lead to greater insight into best treatment options and a better understanding of brain plasticity and neural networking.</p></sec><sec id="section15-1352458514546076"><title>YI2.5 An investigation of cervical spinal cord lesion location and extent in subtypes of multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>H Kearney</underline><sup>1</sup>, KA Miszkiel<sup>2</sup>, MC Yiannakas<sup>1</sup>, DR Altmann<sup>1,3</sup>, O Ciccarelli<sup>1,4</sup>, DH Miller<sup>1,4</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UCL Institute of Neurology, NMR Research Unit, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Department of Neuroradiology, London, United Kingdom, <sup>3</sup>London School of Hygeine and Tropical Medicine, Medical Statistics Department, London, United Kingdom, <sup>4</sup>NIHR University College London Hospitals Biomedical Research Centre, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Pathology studies of the spinal cord in multiple sclerosis (MS) have shown lesions of varying size and location, with variable involvement of white matter columns and gray matter (GM).

Disability was estimated using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). We performed 3T axial MRI scans in the cervical cord using 3D-fast field echo and phase sensitive inversion recovery sequences with 0.5 x 0.5 mm<sup>2</sup> in-plane resolution. Focal lesions were classified as follows: type Ia - lesions restricted to a single white matter column, type Ib - lesion in one column and involving GM, type II - lesions involving 2 columns, type III - lesions involving 3 columns. The GM was involved in all type II and III lesions. We noted all diffuse abnormalities seen. Associations with disability were investigated using regression analysis.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 374 focal lesions: SPMS (136 lesions, 100% subjects), PPMS (107, 96%), RRMS (99, 85%) and CIS (32, 40%).

As new technologies have been applied an emerging disease model has evolved driven by modern genetics, epigenetics, and observations in the EAE model. First, MS is inheritable, strongly clustering with other autoimmune diseases; genome wide association studies have identified variation in predominantly immune genetic loci. Recent techniques have allowed a more precise identification of nucleotide changes and the mechanisms that cause heritable differences among individuals. MS is dictated by genetic variants that are predominantly in the open chromatid of T cells and B cells associated in particular with the NFkB, EBF1, and MEF2A transcription factor binding sites. Environmental stimuli interacting with these genetic factors appear to trigger the activation of myelin reactive T cells. CD4 cell libraries generated from patients and control subjects from na&#x000ef;ve, CCR6 neg memory, or CCR6+ memory populations isolated ex vivo from blood and interrogated for reactivity to myelin self-antigens revealed that autoreactive T cells in patients with MS predominantly resided in CCR6 positive memory T cell compartment, secreting the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, GM-CSF, and IFN&#x003b3;, but less IL-10 as compared to controls. Moreover, myelin-reactive T cells from MS patients exhibited a pathogenic gene expression signature similar to the encephalitogenic T cells in EAE. However, MS is not simple due to &#x0201c;bad genes&#x0201d;, but instead is the bad outcome of too many variants in non-coding regions leading to a lower threshold of T cell activation in response to multiple environmental factors, including lower vitamin D, smoking, higher body mass index, exposure to EBV, and perhaps higher salt intake. In this regard, increased salt in the diet dramatically boost the induction of Th17 cells mediated by SGK1. Th17 cells generated under high-salt display a pathogenic phenotype characterized by the up-regulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17, GM-CSF, TNF&#x003b1; and IL-2. In summary, myelin-reactive T cells have a lower threshold of activation in MS that is genetically determined. Environmental stimuli interacting with these genetic factors appear to trigger the activation of myelin reactive T cells secreting inflammatory cytokines mediating the disease.</p></sec><sec id="section18-1352458514546076"><title>PS1 - Cell-based therapies</title><sec id="section19-1352458514546076"><title>PS1.1 How stem cells speak with the host immune system</title><p><underline>S Pluchino</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>John van Geest Centre for Brain Repair and Wellcome Trust-Medical Research Council Stem Cell Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom</p><p>Advances in stem cell biology have raised great expectations that diseases of the central nervous system may be ameliorated by the development of non-haematopoietic stem cell medicines. Yet, the application of stem cells as therapeutics is challenging and the interpretation of some of the outcomes ambiguous. The initial idea that stem cell transplants work only via structural cell replacement has been challenged by the observation of consistent intercellular information exchange between the graft and the host. . Sustained stem cell graft-to-host exchange of signals has led to remarkable trophic effects on endogenous brain cells and beneficial modulatory actions on innate and adaptive immune responses that ultimately promote the healing of the injured CNS.

Part drugs and part devices, NSCs work as naturally occurring disease modifying agents that sense signals, migrate to specific sites in the body and execute complex response behaviors. Still, the major limitations of human NSCs therapies are the source from which stem cells are derived (either embryonic or foetal), the immunogenicity of the allogeneic graft and the genotypic instability over extensive passaging in vitro. The direct conversion of somatic cells (e.g. skin fibroblasts) into induced NSCs (iNSCs) is a promising alternative to conventional stem cell treatments. iNSCs cell reprogramming is direct, highly efficient, and rapid.

Mesenchymal stem cell-neural progenitors (MSC-NPs) are an autologous bone marrow-derived population of regenerative cells currently under investigation as a novel MS treatment targeting CNS repair and regeneration. In preclinical studies in mouse EAE, we established that intrathecal (IT) delivery of MSC-NPs given in three separate doses was associated with cell migration to lesion areas, suppression of local inflammatory response, and trophic support for damaged cells at the lesion site. These pathological features were associated with improvement in clinical scores of EAE. The initial clinical experience with IT administration of autologous MSC-NPs in seven MS patients also supported the dosing, safety, feasibility, and potential efficacy of this therapeutic approach. Based on these promising pre-clinical and early clinical data, the FDA approved the initiation of a phase I clinical trial investigating IT autologous MSC-NPs in 20 patients with MS.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of three IT administrations of autologous MSC-NPs in patients with progressive MS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study is a 20 patient, open-label, phase I clinical study of autologous MSC-NPs administered IT in three doses of up to 10 million cells per injection, spaced three months apart. Pre-administration quality testing of autologous MSC-NPs expanded from bone marrow aspirates included analysis of sterility, purity, identity, and chromosomal stability. Primary safety outcomes include adverse event assessments. Secondary outcomes to observe trends in efficacy include neurological exam, MRI, evoked potentials, and urodynamics testing.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The study enrolled 20 MS patients with established disability (average EDSS 6.0, range 3.5 to 8.5) and relatively stable disease as evidenced by less than 1.0 point change in EDSS in the last year, and stable MRI disease burden with no enhancing lesions in the last six months. Bone marrow MSCs from all study subjects were isolated, expanded, and tested according to release criteria.

Healthy individuals who do not exhibit signs of neurological dysfunction commonly have brain MRI studies performed for a reason other than an evaluation for MS that reveal unexpected anomalies highly suggestive of demyelinating plaques given their size, location, and morphology. These healthy subjects lack symptomatology suggestive of MS and fulfill formal criteria for radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS), a recently described MS subtype that expands upon the phenotype of at-risk individuals for future demyelinating events. A formal description of RIS was first introduced in 2009 by Okuda et al., to define this relevant cohort of individuals who are at risk for future demyelinating events.</p><p>In European or North American observational studies, the authors have found that up to 30-45% of patients presenting with a RIS will present clinical progression.Most patients who develop clinical symptoms had prior radiological progression.</p><p>Cortical lesions are present in up to 40% of RIS patients and their presence are more frequent in those patients with positive oligoclonal bands CSF, cervical cord lesions and dissemination in time on a follow-up brain MRI. Cognitive impairment is observed in RIS patients, and 2 studies demonstrated a significant proportion of patients with cognitive decline compared to healthy controls. The consortium studying epidemiology of RIS worldwide (RISC) presented their first retrospective cohort last year. The mean age at RIS diagnosis was 37.2 years with mean clinical follow-up time of 4.4 years.The 5-year observed conversion rate to the first clinical event was 34%.

The discovery of NMO-specific aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-IgG or NMO-IgG has truly accelerated clinical and experimental research of NMO, and contributed to establishing &#x0201c;NMO spectrum disorders (NMOSD)&#x0201d;, a wider clinical spectrum than a typical severe opticomyelitis in the original description. Epidemiological date on NMOSD are still insufficient, but the prevalence is estimated to be 1-5/100,000 in most parts of the world.</p><p>New international consensus diagnostic criteria of NMOSD, which is expected to be published later this year, is essentially based on AQP4-IgG serostatus and core characteristics of NMOSD, namely, optic neuritis, acute myelitis, and area postrema and some other brain syndromes, although alternative diagnoses should be carefully ruled out. Unlike AQP4-IgG-positive NMOSD requiring only one core clinical feature, two or more core clinical characteristics are needed for diagnosing NMOSD in cases without AQP4-IgG or those with unknown serostatus, but we need to be careful that this group may be heterogeneous. We anticipate that the new criteria will facilitate early diagnosis and treatment which will eventually improve the long-term prognosis. NMO has long been discussed in the category of inflammatory demyelinating diseases, but accumulated pathological and experimental evidence strongly suggests that AQP4-IgG-associated NMOSD is an autoimmune astrocytopathic disease.</p><p>On the other hand, the development of highly sensitive specific assays of AQP4-IgG has enabled us to identify AQP4-IgG-seronegative NMOSD with some features distinct from seropositive cases. Recently, antibodies to myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) have been detected in a fraction of cases of AQP4-IgG-seronegative NMOSD. It is interesting to find out whether the detection of MOG-IgG has pathogenetic and therapeutic implications.</p><p>Despite lack of high-level evidence, treatment of NMOSD has made significant progress in the past decade, and a variety of immunesuppressants and monoclonal antibodies are being administered or developed in clinical practice. Some disease modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis are deleterious in NMOSD for reasons not fully understood. There have been active discussions on advantages and disadvantages in various clinical trial designs for this intractable disease.</p><p>An overview of NMOSD including above-mentioned issues will be provided in this session.</p></sec><sec id="section28-1352458514546076"><title>PS2.3 Bright spotty lesions of spinal cord: another MRI clue for neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder?</title><p><underline>J-W Hyun</underline><sup>1</sup>, S-H Kim<sup>1</sup>, IH Jeong<sup>1</sup>, SH Lee<sup>2</sup>, HJ Kim<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>National Cancer Center, Neurology, Goyang, Korea, Republic of, <sup>2</sup>National Cancer Center, Radiology, Goyang, Korea, Republic of</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Bright spotty lesions (BSLs) on spinal MRI were recently reported to be a discriminative finding of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) from multiple sclerosis (MS), in combination of longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to determine whether BSLs can discriminate NMOSD from MS as well as idiopathic transverse myelitis (ITM).</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> One-hundred twenty-seven spinal MRIs taken at acute phase from 59 patients with NMOSD (n=62 MRIs), 31 with MS (n=32 MRIs) and 24 with ITM (n=33 MRIs) were reviewed independently by one neuroradiologist and two neurologists without knowledge of the diagnosis. The presence of BSLs, lesion length, axial location and the presence of gadolinium enhancement were evaluated. BSLs were defined as very hyperintense spotty lesions on axial T2-weighted imaging (WI), which signals are at least as high as surrounding CSF on T2WI, but not as low as CSF on T1WI. In order to investigate whether the BSLs may represent attack severity, EDSS scores at nadir of myelitis attacks were analyzed.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The male:female ratio (16:8 vs. 8:51 vs. 15:16; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and mean age of onset (44.0&#x000b1;9.6 vs. 35.9&#x000b1;11.4 vs. 34.2&#x000b1;9.8 ; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.001) were higher in ITM than NMOSD and MS patients.

In contrast, LETM was commonly found both in ITM (26/33, 78.8%) and NMOSD (58/59, 93.5%) patients, while very rare in MS patients (2/32, 6.3%). Among 17 NMOSD patients who had BSLs, follow-up MRIs were available in 10 patients and BSLs were disappeared after 6 months in all patients.

Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is a novel technique that enables to detect and quantify iron deposition. Ultra-high field MRI has markedly improved sensitivity in detecting tissue susceptibility differences. Pathologic iron accumulation has been reported in MS, but there are no studies on iron content in NMO lesions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To characterize and compare iron deposition in MS and NMO lesions using ultra-high-field QSM MRI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Fourteen MS and 11 NMO patients underwent imaging at 7T MRI (Siemens) using a 24-channel head coil. The imaging protocol included T2, GRE-T2*,T1-weighted, and FLAIR images. QSM Imaging was performed using high resolution (in plane resolution: 0.23x0.23mm<sup>2</sup>) 3D susceptibility weighted imaging. An in-house developed susceptibility weighting imaging map algorithm was used to reconstruct QSM maps. The patterns of different lesions were assessed on T2/T2* and QSM images based on the presence of QSM hyperintensity associated with iron deposition.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> A total of 124 lesions were observed in MS patients (mean 8.8 lesions/patient) versus 25 lesions in NMO patients (2.2/patient). Of MS patients, 13/14 had at least one hyperintense lesion on QSM, while none of 11 NMO patients showed hyperintensity in lesions (p&#x0003c; 0.0001). In 14 MS patients, all lesions on T2*/T2 images with hypointense components were observed as hyperintense on QSM (Type A, n=26), reflecting iron accumulation in these lesions. Some T2/T2* lesions without hypointensity (Type B, n=16) also showed hyperintense iron component on QSM, suggesting QSM is more sensitive than T2*/T2 for subtle iron deposition detection. QSM values for Type A lesions (45.8&#x000b1;19.6ppb) were significantly higher than that of Type B lesions (23.4&#x000b1;9.1ppb, p&#x0003c; 0.0002). However, most MS lesions (Type C, n=82) without hypointense signal on T2/T2* did not show any hyperintensity on QSM, without indication of iron deposition in these lesions. We believe the different patterns of QSM signal are attributed to the combined effects from iron accumulation (paramagnetic) and myelin (diamagnetic) loss since both causes hyperintensity on QSM.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Absence of QSM hyperintensity in NMO suggests that, iron deposition is not a feature of NMO lesions. QSM may be useful for differentiating MS from NMO and offers insight into the pathogenesis of tissue injury and lesion evolution in MS.</p></sec><sec id="section30-1352458514546076"><title>PS2.5 Autoantibodies against MOG and aquaporin-4 identify distinct neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders subgroups</title><p><underline>DK Sato</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Callegaro<sup>2</sup>, MA Lana-Peixoto<sup>3</sup>, PJ Waters<sup>4</sup>, S Tanaka<sup>5</sup>, FMH Jorge<sup>2</sup>, T Takahashi<sup>1</sup>, T Misu<sup>6</sup>, SL Apostolos-Pereira<sup>2</sup>, N Talim<sup>3</sup>, RF Simm<sup>2</sup>, I Nakashima<sup>1</sup>, K Nomura<sup>5</sup>, M Aoki<sup>1</sup>, K Fujihara<sup>6</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Tohoku University, Neurology, Sendai, Japan, <sup>2</sup>University of Sao Paulo, Neurology, S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil, <sup>3</sup>Federal University of Minas Gerais, CIEM MS Research Center, Belo Horizonte, Brazil, <sup>4</sup>Oxford University, Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford, United Kingdom, <sup>5</sup>Saitama Medical University, Neurology, Saitama, Japan, <sup>6</sup>Tohoku University, Multiple Sclerosis Therapeutics, Sendai, Japan</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is characterized by severe attacks of optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM). More than half of NMOSD patients are positive for aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-antibodies, but seronegative patients require further characterization and clarification of underlying pathogenesis. Autoantibodies against myelin-oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) were recently reported in AQP4-antibody seronegative NMOSD.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare the clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with MOG antibodies to those from AQP4-antibody positive and seronegatives in a large cohort clinically diagnosed as NMOSD.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 290 pediatric and adult NMOSD cases from 4 tertiary centers from Japan and Brazil. Sera were tested for AQP4-antibodies and MOG-antibodies using cell based assays with transfected living cells.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> One hundred sixty-six NMOSD patients were positive for AQP4-antibodies and 134 were negative. Only 16.3% (27/166) of the patients with AQP4 antibodies had a single attack. Among the AQP4-antibody seronegative NMOSD, 26.1% (35/134) patients were positive for MOG antibodies, and 42.9% (15/35) had a single attack. None was positive for both antibodies. Patients with MOG-antibodies usually had a more limited phenotype than seronegative and AQP4-antibody positive patients. In contrast to patients with AQP4-antibodies, patients with MOG-antibodies and seronegatives did not have female predominance and brainstem lesions with nausea or hiccups were uncommon. Patients with MOG-antibodies who had attacks limited to recurrent or bilateral simultaneous optic neuritis usually had a good recovery of visual acuity, and those patients with myelitis had more often spinal cord lesions distributed in the lower portion of the spinal cord. Although patients with MOG antibodies had optic neuritis with severe loss of visual acuity (below 20/200) or transverse myelitis during attacks, they had low presence of painful tonic spasms, and usually recovered better (visual and motor) with less sustained disability than the other serological groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> NMOSD patients with MOG-antibodies have distinct clinical features and less disability than seronegative and AQP4-antibody positive patients, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Identification of MOG-antibody positive patients may be useful in the diagnosis and prognostication of the disease in patients who were seronegative for AQP4-antibodies.</p></sec><sec id="section31-1352458514546076"><title>PS2.6 Anti-MOG immune response characterizes a subgroup of AQP4-seronegative patients with a NMO phenotype</title><p><underline>A-K Pr&#x000f6;bstel</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, G Rudolf<sup>3</sup>, N Sanderson<sup>2</sup>, K Dornmair<sup>4</sup>, N Collongues<sup>3</sup>, J-B Chanson<sup>3</sup>, L Kappos<sup>1,2</sup>, J de Seze<sup>3</sup>, T Derfuss<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Basel, Department of Neurology, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>University Basel, Department of Biomedicine, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>Hopitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg, Hopital de Hautpierre, Department of Neurology, Strasbourg, France, <sup>4</sup>University Hospital Grosshadern, Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, Munich, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a clinically defined autoimmune inflammatory disorder of the central nervous system. Antibodies against aquaporin-4 (AQP4) are present in 50-90% of the patients. Recent evidence hints at the presence of anti-myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies in some AQP4-seronegative patients. However, the frequency as well as the pathogenic, diagnostic and prognostic relevance of these anti-MOG antibodies remains unclear.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the frequency of antibodies against native MOG in AQP4-seronegative and -seropositive NMO and multiple sclerosis (MS) patients and to correlate anti-MOG antibody findings with clinical and MRI characteristics. Moreover, we also aimed at investigating the cellular immune response against MOG.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed the presence of anti-MOG immunoglobulins (IgG) in a total of 101 sera from patients with NMO (n=53) and MS (n=48) in a blinded fashion. Anti-MOG IgG reactivity was determined by the ratio of the geometric mean channel fluorescence (GMCF) of the transfected and the untransfected cell lines in flow cytometry. The cut-off was calculated to be 1.45 (mean GMCF ratio plus two standard deviations of a control group measured in parallel). Immunofluorescent stainings with anti-MOG IgG and analysis of the cellular immune response against MOG are carried out in parallel.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 6 out of 53 patients with clinically definite NMO tested positive for IgG against native conformational MOG. All of them are anti-AQP4 seronegative. The anti-MOG IgG positive patients differed from anti-AQP4 IgG positive patients in terms of epidemiological (MOG vs. AQP4 reactivity: female 67 vs. 74%; mean age 50 vs. 45 years), clinical (first presentation with both myelitis and optic neuritis 50 vs. 16%, presence of OCBs 60 vs. 16%, median EDSS at sample date/follow-up 3.8/2.8 vs. 3.0/3.0) and MRI features (brain lesions 50 vs. 16%, longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis 83 vs. 87%).

Several studies have shown that this sequence is very sensitive towards MS lesions in the brain, especially with respect to intracortical lesions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Spinal cord imaging in MS is still challenging, though very important for diagnosis and prognosis. An analogous DIR sequence for spinal cord imaging, however, has not yet been established in the clinical routine, so far.

Axial, sagittal and coronal multiplanar reconstructions (MPR) were performed as post processing of the DIR sequence. Two neuroradiologists assessed the scans in pseudo-randomized order for lesion number independently. Afterwards, an additional consensus reading delivered the definite lesion count. Furthermore, the standardized contrast to noise ratio (sCNR) was calculated in representative lesions of each patient.

Conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques detect very few GM lesions, and so in previous work the majority of such lesions will have been included in apparently normal appearing (NA) GM. Different quantitative MRI techniques have been used to detect subtle changes in the NAGM in MS including magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) measurement. However, it is uncertain how much NAGM abnormalities relate to, or are independent of, GM lesions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To compare MTR in intracortical (IC) lesions and cortical (c) NAGM in different subtypes of MS, and assess associations with neurological and cognitive function.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), MS functional composite (MSFC) scores and MRI data from 46 people with relapsing-remitting (RR), 26 SP, 20 primary-progressive (PP) MS and 36 matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. We used phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) imaging to identify and segment IC lesions. Cortical GM was segmented from T1-weighted volumetric (1 mm isotropic) scans, and IC lesions removed from this to produce cNAGM masks. These were registered to MTR maps (1 mm isotropic).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The mean age of RRMS patients was 42&#x000b1;10, SPMS 51&#x000b1;7, and PPMS 53&#x000b1;10 years, disease duration 11&#x000b1;8, 20&#x000b1;9, and 14&#x000b1;7 years respectively, and median EDSS score 2 (range 0-7), 6.5 (4-8.5), and 6 (2.5-8). SPMS patients had higher IC lesion volumes than RRMS (p=0.027), whereas IC lesion volumes were not different in the PP and RRMS. Overall, MTR in MS cNAGM was lower than in HCs GM (p&#x0003c; 0.001) and lower in SP than RRMS (p=0.005), but not different in PP compared with RRMS. Similarly, MTR in IC lesions was lower in SP than RR (p&#x0003c; 0.001) or PPMS (p=0.02) even when controlled for lesion size and changes in cNAGM. In the whole MS group, MTR of IC lesions (r=0.34, p&#x0003c; 0.001) and cNAGM (r=0.34, p&#x0003c; 0.001) correlated with the EDSS and MTR in cNAGM with the MSFC scores (r=0.62, p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We found greater structural abnormalities in both cortical lesions and cNAGM in SPMS than in RRMS and PPMS. The findings are consistent with cortical pathology contributing to progression, especially in SPMS. Correlations with disability scores were most consistent with cNAGM rather than IC lesion measures, which highlights the independent role of cNAGM in disability accrual in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section39-1352458514546076"><title>PS4 - EAE and other animal models</title><sec id="section40-1352458514546076"><title>PS4.1 What can EAE teach us about MS?</title><p><underline>JM Goverman</underline><sup>1</sup>, MC Johnson<sup>1</sup>, ER Pierson<sup>1</sup>, SB Simmons<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Washington, Immunology, Seattle, WA, United States</p><p>Using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) animal model, we studied the role of IL-17 and IFN-g signalling in shaping neuroinflammatory patterns in the CNS. We compared manifestation of EAE induced by adoptive transfer of myelin-specific T cells into wild-type, IL-17receptor A and IFN-g receptor knock-out mice. Our data indicate that these cytokines exert very different effects on inflammation in the brain compared to the spinal cord. In the brain, we found that IL-17 signalling promoted, but IFN-g signalling inhibited, induction of the ELR+ chemokine CXCL2, which correlated with neutrophil recruitment to this region. Neutrophil recruitment to the brain was required for tissue injury. In contrast, IFN-g promoted CXCL2 induction and recruitment of neutrophils to the spinal cord and IL-17 signalling was not required. Surprisingly, tissue injury in the spinal cord did not exhibit the same dependence on neutrophil recruitment that was seen in the brain. These data in EAE suggest that the brain and spinal cord exhibit distinct sensitivities to mediators of tissue damage that are recruited subsequent to initial IL-17 and IFN-g signalling. In MS, many patients exhibit lesions in the brain with minimal involvement of the spinal cord, and a small percentage of patients exhibit lesions predominantly in the spinal cord with less lesion involvement in the brain. We have begun analysing the frequency of MBP-specific IL-17 and IFN-g producing T cells in the blood of these two types of patients to determine if patients with MS that exhibit distinct neuroinflammatory patterns differ in the relative abundance of myelin-specific TH17 and TH1 cells. Our preliminary findings reveal significant differences in the TH17 and TH1 cells between these patient groups. The implication of these findings will be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="section41-1352458514546076"><title>PS4.2 New animal models and human studies are necessary to understand MS</title><p><underline>H Lassmann</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical University of Vienna, Center for Brain Research, Wien, Austria</p><p>Experimental models of inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system have provided major contributions to our understanding of immune surveillance of the brain and on the mechanisms of brain inflammation. They have also served as the basis for the development of current anti-inflammatory and immune-modulatory therapies in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, their value to unravel the mechanisms involved in demyelination and neurodegeneration in MS lesions has been limited. MS like widespread primary demyelination can be induced in experimental models by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes directed against oligodendrocyte antigens as well as by demyelinating antibodies. However, evidence from clinical and neuropathological studies in MS patients for involvement of cytotoxic T-cells and demyelinating auto-antibodies is sparse and this is particularly the case in patients with progressive disease. Recent immunopathological data indicate that microglia activation, oxidative injury and mitochondrial damage and dysfunction play a major role in propagating demyelination, oligodendrocyte death and neurodegeneration in MS lesions. This constellation appears to be unique in MS lesions and is not present in other inflammatory diseases of the human brain, nor in current experimental virus induced or autoimmune models of the disease. A direct immunopathological comparison of MS lesions with those seen in experimental models suggests differences in the patterns of inflammation and oxidative burst activation of microglia. Furthermore, potential amplification factors for neurodegeneration in the human brain, related to aging and accumulation of disease burden, which are prominent in the progressive stage of MS, are not seen even in the most chronic experimental models of inflammatory demyelinating disease. The potential role of such amplification factors in conditions of brain inflammation can, however, in part be analyzed in new models of autoimmune encephalomyelitis induced in animals with genetic dysfunction of mitochondria or disturbed iron metabolism. The further development of such new models will be instrumental for pre-clinical testing of drugs targeting the progressive stage of MS.</p></sec><sec id="section42-1352458514546076"><title>PS4.3 The multiple sclerosis risk gene IL22RA2 contributes to a more severe murine autoimmune neuroinflammation</title><p><underline>H Laaksonen</underline><sup>1</sup>, A Ortlieb<sup>1</sup>, M Zeitelhofer Adzemovic<sup>1</sup>, R Parsa<sup>1</sup>, M Zeitelhofer<sup>1</sup>, M Jagodic<sup>1</sup>, T Olsson<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The gene interleukin-22 receptor alpha 2 (IL22RA2) is associated to MS susceptibility in two large international studies and has furthermore been a candidate gene affecting severity of a rat model of MS in our lab.

<italic>Clostridium perfringens</italic> (<italic>C. perfringens</italic>) epsilon toxin (&#x003b5;-toxin) is a candidate for initiating nascent lesion formation in Multiple Sclerosis (MS).

Intestinal permeability allows entry of the toxin into the blood stream where it can travel to the brain and specifically target the brain microvasculature and oligodendrocytes, resulting in the pathologic hallmarks of the newly forming MS lesion: blood brain barrier permeability (BBB) and oligodendrocyte cell death.

In addition, &#x003b5;-toxin also binds to the blood vessels and myelin of the optic nerve, possibly explaining the high incidence of optic neuritis in MS patients. Finally, we demonstrate that &#x003b5;-toxin binds to the vasculature of brain-associated meninges and kills meningeal cells; perhaps elucidating a mechanism of MS related meningeal inflammation.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Taken together, these observations indicate that &#x003b5;-toxin specifically targets the same cells associated with MS inflammation, providing more evidence that &#x003b5;-toxin may be responsible for initiating MS.</p></sec><sec id="section44-1352458514546076"><title>PS4.5 Co-expressed astrocytic ECGF1/TP and VEGF-A cooperatively promote blood-brain barrier breakdown in inflammatory CNS disease</title><p><underline>A Tadesse Argaw</underline><sup>1</sup>, C Chapouly<sup>1</sup>, S Horng<sup>1</sup>, K Castro<sup>2</sup>, G John<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for MS, Friedman Brain Institute and Neurology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States, <sup>2</sup>Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for MS, Neurology, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In inflammatory CNS conditions such as multiple sclerosis (MS), breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) correlates with lesion activity and neurologic exacerbation, and contributes to tissue damage.

ECGF1/TP acts via production of 2-deoxy-D-ribose 1-phosphate (DDR), and in human CNS microvascular endothelial cultures (CMVEC) DDR and VEGF-A produce distinct transcriptional program. These include induction of drivers of plasticity and permeability, and repression of tight junction proteins, notably CLN-5, a critical determinant of barrier integrity. Individually, DDR and VEGF-A differentially promote endothelial migration, proliferation and permeability, and produce additive outcomes in combination. Their introduction into mouse cortex individually produces CLN-5 downregulation, BBB opening and neuronal loss, and together they exacerbate these outcomes. In cortical IL-1&#x003b2;-induced inflammatory lesions in mice, and in the MS model EAE, ECGF1/TP and VEGF-A co-localize to reactive astrocytes, and correlate with BBB disruption and neuropathology.

Electrophysiological studies in the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mouse model of MS suggest that cerebellar pathology might be in part characterized by an early reduction in basal cerebellar synaptic transmission. Moreover, the inflammatory milieu present in the central nervous system (CNS) of EAE animals has been proposed as a key determinant of early synaptic plasticity. However, the individual contributions of innate and adaptive immune systems are difficult to dissect in the context of EAE.

Multiple factors are also likely to account for the well-recognized heterogeneity in disease outcomes in MS. Comorbidities, such as mental illness have been recognized as common in MS for many years, with a 50% lifetime prevalence of depression, while physical comorbidities are gaining increasing recognition. A past history of smoking as well as of overweight or obesity are also common. These health behaviors and comorbidities constitute potentially modifiable factors that may influence susceptibility to disease and disease progression after onset. Recent work suggests that obesity in adolescence is associated with an increased risk of MS and that it may influence phenotype after onset. Smoking adversely influences disability progression. Comorbidity is associated with greater disability at diagnosis and more rapid disability progression after diagnosis. Given the frequency of comorbidity with MS, it is imperative that we develop a better understanding of the bidirectional interactions of comorbidity and all aspects of MS.</p></sec><sec id="section48-1352458514546076"><title>PS5.2 Leptin and other adipokines in EAE and MS</title><p><underline>AH Cross</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Washington University School of Medicine, Neurology, Saint Louis, MO, United States</p><p>MS is a presumed autoimmune disease thought to target CNS myelin, but its exact cause is unknown. It is becoming clear that environmental factors play a role in risk of MS development. Diet and obesity are implicated as risk factors. Several recent studies have suggested that being overweight as an adolescent or young adult increases risk of later MS development. Dietary risk factors have been more difficult to define, but may include diets of higher saturated fat content. Adipose tissue is the source of a group of cytokines collectively known as adipokines; these include leptin, adiponectin, and resistin. IL-6 is also made by adipose tissue. Although most adipokines are elevated with increased visceral fat depots, adiponectin is increased during fasting states. Most adipokines are pro-inflammatory, but adiponectin has anti-inflammatory effects. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a main animal model for MS. We and others found that calorie restriction by 40% in two strains of mice greatly reduced the susceptibility to and severity of EAE. Calorie restricted mice in our studies had reduced leptin and IL-6, while displaying elevated adiponectin and corticosterone. The &#x0201c;pro-inflammatory&#x0201d; adipokine leptin appears requisite for EAE induction in C57BL/6 mice; mice with a genetic deletion of leptin do not develop EAE. In contrast, adiponectin appears to ameliorate clinical and histologic EAE in mice. In our studies, mice genetically deficient in adiponectin had worse EAE, with greater inflammation, demyelination and axon injury in the CNS by histology. Lymphocytes from adiponectin deficient (ADP KO) mice proliferated more, and produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines (IFNg, TNFa and IL-6) in vitro than lymphocytes from wild-type (WT) mice. In vivo, passive transfer of encephalitogenic ADP KO lymphocytes induced more severe EAE than a comparable number of WT lymphocytes upon transfer to na&#x000ef;ve recipients, suggesting that adiponectin acts in EAE during the induction phases of T cell priming. At EAE peak, fewer regulatory T cells were apparent in ADP KO mice than in WT mice, suggesting that one mechanism by which adiponectin may modulate autoimmunity is through up-regulation of T-regulatory cells. Based on these results, we have embarked upon a small safety study of intermittent fasting in relapsing MS patients.</p></sec><sec id="section49-1352458514546076"><title>PS5.3 Dietary patterns not associated with the risk of multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>DL Rotstein</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Chiuve<sup>2</sup>, T Chitnis<sup>1</sup>, T Fung<sup>2</sup>, KL Munger<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Neurology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> With the exception of vitamin D, previous studies on diet and multiple sclerosis (MS) risk have yielded null or inconsistent results.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine whether there is any association between measures of overall diet quality (dietary indices/patterns) and the risk of MS.

The outcome of interest was childhood development, expressed as vulnerability (absent vs present) on 5 areas of childhood development at 5 years of age: physical health, social competence, emotional maturity, language development and communication skills, measured by the Early Child Development Instrument (EDI). We compared children who had a parent with MS, were born between 1999 and 2006, and had an EDI assessment to children with parents not affected with MS, who were matched on sex, region and year of the EDI assessment.

Whereas it was originally described in immunosuppressed lymphoma patients and later in HIV infection, It has now afflicted more than 450 MS patients receiving longterm natalizumab treatment. In this context also recently approved novel therapies such as fingolimod and fumarates have entered the discussion on putative PML association.</p><p>Triage procedures for identifying patients at risk include prior immunosuppression, length of natalizumab exposure and anti-JC antibody levels as measured by an improved ELISA screening. In addition, the intrathecal JC antibody-specific immune response and the L-Selectin (CD62L) flow cytometric assay may help to identify people at risk or increase specificity of the diagnosis. Some &#x02039;benign&#x0203a; PML cases have been observed, and there is no doubt that there are variants with only radiological signs albeit their pathophysiology is not well understood. In addition we often observe carry-over effects when patients were switched from natalizumab to fingolimod or fumarates, and initial signs of natalizumab PML were overlooked by non-experienced radiologists or an MRI was not performed.</p><p>The evidence is growing that survival in natalizumab associated PML is much better than in HIV sufferers. The gross survival in natalizumab associated PML is around 80% but may be clearly higher in specialized departments. Still there is the concern that functional outcome as measured by Karnofsky is very much dependent on the initial site of JC infection. Especially in longterm natalizumab recipients there is predominant infratentorial affliction, which translates into more severe residual disability. With the experience of 258 natalizumab PML cases we still recommend to restore the immune system by plasma exchange procedures, yet also consider appropriate management of IRIS and associated seizures. Surprisingly MS stays calm for at least one year after PML.</p><p>So far there is no clear evidence for PML primarily associated with fingolimod, or Tecfidera approved for treatment of relapsing MS.

As a consequence of inhibition of lymphocyte transmigration into the central nervous system, reduced immune surveillance is thought to cause these frequently disabling, and sometimes fatal, brain virus infections. In the case of PML, patients who have been previously exposed to the JC virus, the cause of PML, incur a dose dependent risk that appears to plateau sometime after two years of treatment. Prior treatment with immune suppressants is an additional risk factor. The risk of developing PML varies considerably across patients with a risk of &#x0003c; 1:10,000 for patients who test seronegative for anti-JCV antibodies to a risk of ~1:90 for patients who are JCV seropositive, have had prior exposure to immune suppressant and who have been treated with natalizumab for more than 2 years. Patients and clinicians will electively discontinue natalizumab treatment if the risk of developing PML is thought to outweigh the benefits of ongoing treatment. Treatment discontinuation has been associated with recurrence of disease activity. Recurrence of disease activity coincides with restoration of immune function as measured by the proportion of VLA4 receptors that are bound by natalizumab. Highly inflammatory disease activity as evidenced by relapse severity and multiple contrast enhancing lesions identified on brain MRI has been reported in some patients. This occurrence of inflammation is described as &#x0201c;rebound&#x0201d; and some have suggested that the extent of inflammation in these cases occurs as an unintended consequence of natalizumab treatment. In contrast, others have proposed that &#x0201c;rebound&#x0201d; is return of disease activity that was previously blocked by natalizumab treatment and that the extent of inflammation was not directly influenced by natalizumab treatment. Data will be presented both for and against the case of &#x0201c;rebound&#x0201d;. Selection of treatment following natalizumab discontinuation and the timing of such treatment, i.e. whether a period of no-treatment or a &#x0201c;washout&#x0201d; should be used, will also be discussed.</p></sec><sec id="section56-1352458514546076"><title>PS6.3 Natalizumab-associated JC virus granule cell neuronopathy complicated by immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in a patient with MS</title><p><underline>S Agnihotri</underline><sup>1</sup>, X Dang<sup>2</sup>, J Carter<sup>3</sup>, T Fife<sup>3</sup>, E Bord<sup>2</sup>, S Batson<sup>2</sup>, I Koralnik<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Neurology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Arizona College of Medicine, Neurology, Phoenix, AZ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Natalizumab blocks trafficking of leukocytes to the brain, and has been associated with reactivation of JC virus (JCV) leading to progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.

For patients with previous IS CD62L therefore seems favorable for risk stratification. For non-IS patients, the presented correlation and synergy between the two markers might have implications for the research of biological mechanisms leading to PML and can also help to further individualize risk stratification in long-term natalizumab patients.</p></sec><sec id="section59-1352458514546076"><title>PS6.6 Evolving dark band on T2* weighted high resolution MRI is characteristic of PML</title><p><underline>V Sethi</underline><sup>1</sup>, P Sati<sup>1</sup>, G Nair<sup>1</sup>, M Absinta<sup>1</sup>, G van Geldern<sup>2</sup>, BE Dewey<sup>1</sup>, J Ohayon<sup>1</sup>, I Cortese<sup>1</sup>, A Nath<sup>3</sup>, DS Reich<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>NINDS, NIH, Translational Neuroradiology Unit, Neuroimmunology Branch, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>2</sup>NINDS, NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States, <sup>3</sup>NINDS, NIH, Section of Infections of the Nervous System, Bethesda, MD, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> White matter (WM) lesions are seen in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a demyelinating disease due to reactivation of JC virus in the setting of an altered immune system.

Disease onset typically occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, although approximately 2-5% of all MS patients have symptom onset before 18 years. Disease course in children with MS is similar to adults with important exceptions. Compared to adults, disease typically progresses more slowly using the EDSS, although permanent disability can result at a younger age. Young children with MS are more likely to develop seizures and ataxia during the course of the disease; males are equally affected compared to females within the youngest pediatric MS cases. In addition, pediatric MS cases almost exclusively have a relapsing-remitting course, and are less likely to be of White/European ancestry. Exact mechanisms involved in pediatric MS pathogenesis are unknown; however, similar to adult MS, both genetic and environmental factors such as Epstein-Barr virus and exposure to cigarette smoking have been strongly implicated in disease susceptibility. Variation within major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes on chromosome 6p21 confers the greatest risk of MS, primarily within the human leukocyte antigen HLA-DRB1 locus (specifically, the HLA-DRB1*15:01 allele). Through recent International Consortium efforts, genome-wide association (GWAS) and replication studies have identified at least 110 adult MS susceptibility loci with modest effects. We have investigated these risk variants and genes within the MHC for a role in pediatric MS using a large, well characterized dataset of cases and controls. Our results provide strong support for HLA-DRB1 in pediatric MS susceptibility. In addition, several established adult MS variants were strongly associated with risk of pediatric MS and demonstrated larger effect sizes. Finally, we performed the first GWAS and pathway analysis in pediatric MS and identified evidence for new variants in pediatric MS susceptibility.</p></sec><sec id="section63-1352458514546076"><title>HT1.3 <italic>HLA-DRB1*15:01/03</italic> modifies association of vitamin D level with relapse rate in pediatric MS</title><p><underline>J Graves</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Barcellos<sup>2</sup>, M Milazzo<sup>3</sup>, E Mowry<sup>4</sup>, A Belman<sup>3</sup>, M Rodriguez<sup>5</sup>, B Weinstock-Guttman<sup>6</sup>, M Gorman<sup>7</sup>, L Benson<sup>8</sup>, J Ness<sup>9</sup>, T Lotze<sup>10</sup>, G Aaen<sup>11</sup>, T Chitnis<sup>12</sup>, J Rose<sup>13</sup>, TC Casper<sup>13</sup>, L Krupp<sup>3</sup>, E Waubant<sup>14</sup>, U.S. Network of Pediatric MS Centers</p><p><sup>1</sup>UCSF, San Francisco, CA, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Stonybrook University, Stonybrook, NY, United States, <sup>4</sup>Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States, <sup>5</sup>Mayo Clinic, Rochester, NY, United States, <sup>6</sup>The Pediatric MS Center of the Jacobs Neurological Institute at the University of Buffalo, Buffalo, NY, United States, <sup>7</sup>Children&#x02019;s Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>8</sup>Boston Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>9</sup>The Center for Pediatric-Onset Demyelinating Diseases at Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Alabama, Birmingham, AL, United States, <sup>10</sup>Texas Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>11</sup>Loma Linda University, San Bernadino, CA, United States, <sup>12</sup>The Partners Pediatric MS Center at the Massachusetts General Hospital for Children, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>13</sup>Department of Pediatrics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>14</sup>The Regional Pediatric MS Center at the University of California at San Francisco, San Francisco, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> The strongest genetic risk factor for multiple sclerosis is presence of at least one copy of <italic>HLA-DRB1*15:01</italic> (or <italic>15:03</italic> in those of African descent). Vitamin D level is one of the strongest environmental risk factors consistently identified for MS risk and severity in children and adults.

<italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>*<italic>15:01/03</italic> carrier allele status was determined by Taqman assay for 185 MS or clinically isolated syndrome patients from the Pediatric MS Centers at Stony Brook and UCSF who had received prospective clinical follow-up for relapses. <italic>HLA-DRB1</italic>*<italic>15</italic> status modification of the 25-OH vitamin D level association with relapse hazard was assessed using repeated events Cox regression models.

Significant advances in our understanding of MS pathogenesis have underpinned the development of a number of molecules (or slightly altered versions thereof) that were previously used in other diseases, for the treatment of pwMS. Examples of such repurposing include Teriflunomide (Aubagio), Fingolimod (Gilenya), Dimethyl-Fumarate (Tecfidera), Alemtuzumab (Lemtrada), oral cladribine (Movectro), Laquinimod, Ocrelizumab, Daclizumab, and 4-aminopyridine (Fampyra). Whilst repurposed drugs are thus the mainstay of current MS disease modifying therapy, the more recent discussion around repurposing has focussed on generic drugs that may not only be safe and effective, but also more affordable treatments for pwMS. There is virtually no incentive for manufacturers to (i) fund &#x00026; perform appropriately designed trials and (ii) apply for (and maintain) a license when at the end of such a development programme the license holder is to keep the cost at a generic (ie. low) level. On the other hand, publicly funded health care systems are under significant financial strain and thus highly incentivised to make safe and effective drugs for pwMS available at low cost. However, whilst some public and charity funding is available to perform investigator-led trials of generic drugs, there is no clear pathway to licensing, the key hurdle to make repurposed drugs available for pwMS at low cost. This presentation will summarize a few past and current initiatives to repurpose generic drugs for pwMS at different stages of the disease, and provide a framework for discussion of the implications of such initiatives for pwMS, funding bodies and healthcare providers.</p></sec><sec id="section66-1352458514546076"><title>HT2.2 A perspective on generic medications to treat MS</title><p>JA Cohen<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Neurological Institute, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p>Ten medications currently have regulatory approval as disease therapy for multiple sclerosis (MS). All are very expensive, and medications are a major contributor to the high societal cost of caring for MS. Patent protection for some of these agents (so-called innovator drugs) soon will expire, creating the opportunity for development and regulatory approval of generic versions, with anticipated cost savings to patients and third party payers based on the more limited testing required for approval and resultant reduced development costs. However, there are a many factors complicating the determination of whether generic versions of MS disease therapies are comparably safe and effective as the innovators on which they are based. In general, regulatory approval of "simple" generics (i.e. small molecules) can be based on demonstration of pharmaceutical equivalence and bioequivalence. However, some MS disease therapies are biologics with highly complex chemical structures (e.g. the interferons or monoclonal antibodies) or, in the case of glatiramer acetate, highly complex peptide mixtures. Subtle changes in such things as composition, tertiary structure, aggregation, post-translational modification, etc. could affect efficacy, tolerability, or antigenicity in ways that would be difficult to predict from biochemical analyses (even sophisticated approaches), in vitro studies, or animal studies. For most MS therapies, no biologic response marker that relates to efficacy has been validated. However, the clinical endpoints utilized in MS pivotal trials are relatively insensitive, necessitating large trials extending over several years to show benefit. Requiring comparable trials to approve generics probably would create an insurmountable disincentive to sponsors to develop them. Thus, while clinical trials of complex generics seem unavoidable, it would advantageous for more sensitive outcomes to be accepted when appropriate, e.g. MRI lesion activity when the innovator has a well characterized effect on those parameters. Finally, testing of generics to show equivalence to the innovator drug involves trial designs and statistical analyses that are distinct from those used to demonstrate superiority of an innovator drug vs. placebo or an active comparator. In summary, the development of complex generics involves an interesting balance between a number of considerations, many of which are relatively unfamiliar to MS clinicians and investigators.</p></sec><sec id="section67-1352458514546076"><title>HT2.3 From genetic findings to drug discovery: taking the first step</title><p><underline>NA Patsopoulos</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup>, JM Replogle<sup>1,2,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Brigham &#x00026; Women&#x02019;s Hospital, Neurology, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>2</sup>Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States, <sup>3</sup>Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating inflammatory disease with a strong genetic component. So far more than 100 genetic loci influencing MS susceptibility have been identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), with expectations to double this number in the near future. These findings have been integral to understanding the mechanisms and pathways of MS etiology, but an ultimate goal of the genetic era is to translate these findings into drug discoveries in order to improve patient outcomes.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To explore the potential of GWAS-identified genes in MS for drug targeting and to examine the overlap of these genes with targets of currently MS-approved treatments.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We used the most recently published large-scale genetic studies in MS to examine the associated genetic loci. Within these regions we identified genes genes putatively associated with MS based on proximity. Then we leveraged drug-gene interaction data (druggable genome; DGIdb ) to identify genes that either are targeted by a drug or have the potential to be. In a sensitivity analysis we expanded the list of tested genes by using information on direct protein-protein interactions (PPIs). Finally, we used the DrugBank v4.0 database to identify the gene targets of drugs currently approved for the management of MS.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We identified 160 genes within 111 genome-wide published loci in MS. One fifth of these (n=33) had at least one known interaction with a drug or chemical compound, i.e. are druggable, with overall 138 distinct interactions. These included daclizumab, dinoprostone (prostaglandin E2), abatacept, and the general interferon family. Interestingly there were interactions with drugs that have MS as reported side effect, e.g. adalimumab. In the sensitivity analysis, we identified 793 genes with direct PPIs to MS-genes. Thirty percent (n=241) of these had at least one drug interaction, with ~2,000 interactions overall. In this level we identified MS-approved drugs (interferon betas and natalizumab), and several drugs under investigation for use in MS, e.g. masitinib, rituximab, memantine, alemtuzumab, etc.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We report the druggable potential of the GWAS-identified MS-genes via leveraging information on targets of drugs and chemical compounds. There is evidence that the currently approved or investigational MS drugs are directly or indirectly associated with GWAS-findings. We discuss how this information can be used in drug discovery and drug repositioning.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section68-1352458514546076"><title>HT3 - Symptomatic and rehabilitative strategies</title><sec id="section69-1352458514546076"><title>HT3.1 Cognitive impairment</title><p><underline>MP Amato</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Florence, Dept.

Behavioural and pharmacological interventions on cognition reported in published studies will be reviewed. Recent, well designed studies evaluating behavioural treatment or computerized training for impairment in learning and memory, deficits of attention and executive function have demonstrated some improvement. Controlled studies in relapsing remitting MS indicate interferon (IFN) &#x003b1;-1b and IFN &#x003b1;-1a were associated with modest cognitive improvement. The effects of symptomatic therapies such as anti-fatigue drugs, psychostimulants and Alzheimer&#x02019;s drugs are mainly inconsistent or negative. A few studies yielding positive findings have significant methodological difficulties, limiting the confidence in making any broad treatment recommendations. Since data linking cognitive rehabilitation, symptomatic treatment or disease modifying treatment, to either reducing cognitive decline or improving impaired cognition are limited to date, this field needs to remain a key research focus, identifying new interventions and improving clinical trial methodology.</p></sec><sec id="section70-1352458514546076"><title>HT3.2 Cannabinoids as symptomatic and neuroprotective therapy</title><p><underline>CS Constantinescu</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Nottingham, Neurology, Nottingham, United Kingdom</p><p>Cannabinoids (phytocannabinoids, synthetic cannabinoids and endocannabinoids) are a group of molecules that act on the cannabinoid receptors (CBR) and produce a variety of biological and pharmacological effects. The herb Cannabis sativa has been used for centuries for medicinal purposes, but the discovery of the endocannabinoid system, formed of the endocannabinoids, the CBR and the associated enzymes, which regulates multiple functions in the nervous and immune system, endocrine network, gastrointestinal tract, circulation, etc., has triggered renewed interest in the use of cannabinoids as medicines.</p><p>In multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune mediated demyelinating disease cannabinoids have been used to ameliorate symptoms such as muscle spasticity, pain, and bladder disturbances, for a long time. In addition to their role as symptomatic therapy, cannabinoids&#x02019; beneficial effects in MS may also be through neuroprotective and immunomodulatory mechanisms.</p><p>This presentation provides a review of the clinical studies of cannabinoids in MS. Such studies have used smoked cannabis, plant extracts, the main cannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), or mixtures of THC and cannabidiol (CBD).</p><p>Overall, the studies of cannabinoids for symptomatic relief yielded mixed results, often with side effects outweighing the benefits, in particular due to psychotropic effects of cannabinoids. However, a positive effect on spasticity, pain and some symptoms of bladder dysfunction were seen, mainly on patient-based outcomes, especially with the mucosal spray combination of 1:1 THC and CBD. This drug (nabiximols) is currently approved for treatment of MS spasticity as an add-on to conventional anti-spasticity treatment.</p><p>In view of potential neuroprotective effects, a large randomised controlled trial (CUPID) assessed the effects of dronabinol (THC) on MS progression over 5 years. The study did not show an effect on progression, but the progression rate was slower than expected for both dronabinol and placebo groups during the trial.</p><p>In conclusion, cannabinoids, in particular when used in combinations that reduce their side effects and unwanted psychotropic effects, currently are useful for symptomatic relief of spasticity, pain, and some sphincter disturbances in MS. Neuroprotective and immunomodulatory effects could not be demonstrated in clinical trials but combinations that neutralise side effects or enhance their delivery to the immune system may in future be effective.</p></sec><sec id="section71-1352458514546076"><title>HT3.3 Autonomic symptom burden is associated with MS-related fatigue and quality of life</title><p><underline>M Cortez</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, B Goodman<sup>1</sup>, S Nagi Reddy<sup>3</sup>, J Carter<sup>1</sup>, D Wingerchuk<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Mayo Clinic Arizona, Neurology, Scottsdale, AZ, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Utah, Neurology, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>3</sup>Mayo Clinic Arizona, Scottsdale, AZ, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Non-specific symptoms such as dizziness, heat-intolerance and fatigue are common among MS patients. In some, these symptoms may reflect autonomic dysfunction, with important treatment implications. Though autonomic dysfunction has been described in MS, there are few quantitative reports, and little is known about the relationship of autonomic symptoms and quality of life.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Assess the impact of autonomic symptom burden on disease specific health-related quality of life and its relationship with disease factors such as fatigue severity, disability and disease duration.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> 100 consecutive MS patients seen in subspecialty clinic prospectively completed a questionnaire to assess: quality of life (MSQOL-54); fatigue severity (FSS); autonomic symptoms (COMPASS-31). Exclusion criteria: EDSS &#x0003e; 7.5; inability to complete questionnaire; unestablished diagnosis. Clinical data was collected via retrospective review of the electronic medical record. Pearson correlations were used to assess the relationship between autonomic symptoms and fatigue, quality of life, disability and disease duration.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Of the 100 patients, mean age was 48 years (SD 11), 78% female; 84% were relapsing-remitting, mean disease duration 14.7 years (SD 9); EDSS 2.5 (SD 2). Questionnaire completion rate was over 71% for all calculations. Mean COMPASS-31 score was 27/100 (n=81) and mean FSS score was 5 (SD 1.6; n=94). The composite scores for MSQOL-54 were 58 physical health (SD 20; n=87) and 65 mental health (SD 21; n=98). COMPASS-31 correlated with MSQOL-54 composites (physical R=&#x02212;0.60, n=71; mental -0.54, n=79; p&#x0003c; 0.001) and FSS (R=0.51; p&#x0003c; 0.001; n=77). There was no significant relationship between COMPASS-31 and EDSS (R=0, p=0.97, 95% CI=&#x02212;0.21 to 0.22) or disease duration (R=&#x02212;0.02, p=0.84, 95% CI=&#x02212;0.24 to 0.2) (n=81). The relationship of autonomic symptoms and QOL was independent of marital status, fatigue-causing medications and depression.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Autonomic symptom burden is correlated with decreased quality of life and increased fatigue, but not disability or disease duration. Autonomic symptoms are present at early stages of disease and at low levels of disability, and may reflect either non-disease-specific factors or aspects of disease burden that are not well-captured by current disability measures. Further research will investigate disease-specific domains of autonomic dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section72-1352458514546076"><title>FC1 - Free Communication 1</title><sec id="section73-1352458514546076"><title>FC1.1 Primary results of DECIDE: a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active-controlled trial of daclizumab HYP vs. Interferon &#x003b2;-1a in RRMS patients</title><p><underline>L Kappos</underline><sup>1</sup>, K Selmaj<sup>2</sup>, DL Arnold<sup>3,4</sup>, E Havrdov&#x000e1;<sup>5</sup>, A Boyko<sup>6</sup>, M Kaufman<sup>7</sup>, H Wiendl<sup>8</sup>, J Rose<sup>9</sup>, S Greenberg<sup>10</sup>, E Demirhan<sup>11</sup>, M Sweetser<sup>11</sup>, K Riester<sup>11</sup>, J Elkins<sup>11</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>2</sup>Medical University of Lodz, Lodz, Poland, <sup>3</sup>NeuroRx Research, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>4</sup>McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada, <sup>5</sup>First School of Medicine, Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, <sup>6</sup>Moscow Multiple Sclerosis Center, Moscow, Russian Federation, <sup>7</sup>Carolinas Medical Center, Charlotte, NC, United States, <sup>8</sup>University of M&#x000fc;nster, M&#x000fc;nster, Germany, <sup>9</sup>University of Utah Medical School, Salt Lake City, UT, United States, <sup>10</sup>Abbvie Biotherapeutics Inc, Redwood City, CA, United States, <sup>11</sup>Biogen Idec, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Daclizumab high-yield process (DAC HYP) is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody specific for the alpha subunit (CD25) of the human high-affinity interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor in clinical development for relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis (MS).

Because glatiramer acetate (COP, Teva) is a complex polypeptide mixture, precluding pharmacokinetic comparison, a generic version should demonstrate equivalence in efficacy and safety.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> The GATE trial aimed to show that generic glatiramer acetate (GTR, Synthon B.V.) was equivalent to COP measured by MRI and clinical endpoints, safety, and tolerability in RRMS.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Ambulatory RRMS patients age 18-55 years with &#x02a7e;1 relapse in the year prior to screening and 1-15 gadolinium-enhanced (GdE) brain lesions were randomized 4.3:4.3:1 in a multicenter, double-blind, placebo (PLC)-controlled trial to receive 20 mg GTR, 20 mg COP, or PLC by daily subcutaneous injection for 9 months. The primary endpoint was combined number of GdE lesions over months 7, 8, and 9. Additional efficacy endpoints included other MRI parameters, annualized relapse rate (ARR), Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), and freedom from disease activity. Safety and tolerability were assessed through monitoring of adverse events, injection site reactions, and routine blood laboratory tests.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 794 patients were randomized and treated with GTR (n= 353), COP (n=357), or PLC (n=84). 735 patients (92.5%) completed the 9-month double-blind treatment period. The estimated geometric mean numbers of GdE lesions were 0.42 (GTR) and 0.39 (COP), resulting in an estimated GTR/COP GdE lesion ratio of 1.097 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.884-1.362, which is within the pre-defined equivalence margin. The estimated geometric mean numbers of GdE lesions for both the GTR and COP groups were lower than the PLC group (p&#x0003c; 0.001), confirming assay sensitivity. ARRs were 0.31 (GTR), 0.41 (COP), and 0.39 (PLC). Comparable proportions of patients treated with GTR and COP were free from disease activity. EDSS was stable in all three groups. The incidence, spectrum, and severity of reported adverse events, including injection site reactions, were similar in the GTR and COP groups.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> GTR is equivalent to COP in reducing the number of GdE lesions, a clinically relevant endpoint in RRMS. Both active treatments were superior to PLC. Other efficacy outcomes, safety, and tolerability also were comparable.

Long-term efficacy evaluation included patients from ALLEGRO and BRAVO (except patients who switched from IFN&#x003b2;-1a to LAQ) using an intention-to-treat approach.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Assessments were based on 1009 patients with mean (&#x000b1;SD) LAQ exposure of 3.7 (&#x000b1;1.0) yrs. Adverse event (AE) and serious AE rates were lower during open-label extension than in the core studies. Less than 3% of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs during the open-label extension. No new common AE was identified. Musculoskeletal AE rate was lower during long-term follow-up than during the core studies (25.5%/100 patient-years, vs. 31.9% and 26.0% for LAQ and placebo, respectively, during the core phases).

BVL was consistently reduced by fingolimod in three phase 3 studies. Composite measures of MS disease activity are increasingly used to capture overall treatment benefit. Definitions of disease-activity-free (DAF) or no evidence of disease activity (NEDA) currently comprise three domains: disability progression, relapses, and active MRI lesions (both T2 and Gd+ T1), but do not include MRI outcomes related directly to irreversible damage.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the impact of including BVL in the definition of DAF on the proportions of fingolimod- or placebo-treated DAF patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The proportions of DAF patients receiving fingolimod 0.5 mg (n=783) or placebo (n=773) were compared in a pooled population from the two 2-year, phase 3 trials, FREEDOMS/FREEDOMS II. The revised DAF composite includes two clinical measures reflecting disease activity and severity (i.e. confirmed relapses and 6-month confirmed disability progression, defined as an increase in EDSS score of 1.5 points for patients with a baseline score of 0 or of 1.0 point for those with a baseline score of &#x02a7e;1.0), one measure of MRI activity (new/enlarging T2 lesions) and BVL, defined as an annual percentage brain volume change (PBVC) of &#x02a7e;&#x02212;0.4% (a value between the ranges of mean annual BVL in healthy adults [0.1-0.3%] and MS patients [0.5-1.35%]). Other BVL thresholds were tested (&#x02212;0.2% to &#x02212;1.2% PBVC) or BVL was omitted. Patients were classified as DAF only in the absence of activity in all clinical/MRI measures.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Without inclusion of BVL, the respective proportions of DAF patients for fingolimod and placebo were 31.0% vs 9.9% (odds ratio [OR], 4.07; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). Adding BVL (PBVC, &#x02212;0.4% per annum), the respective proportions of DAF patients were smaller, but the between-group OR remained significant and was numerically higher (19.7% vs 5.3%; OR, 4.41; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001). Notably, across the range of thresholds tested with BVL added, the difference in DAF status always favoured fingolimod over placebo (OR, 4.01-4.41; <italic>p</italic>&#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Compared with the previous DAF composite, inclusion of BVL increased the stringency of the measure without decreasing its sensitivity to treatment effects in these studies. Using the 0.4% PBVC threshold in the DAF composite, 3.72-fold more patients treated with fingolimod remained DAF compared with placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section78-1352458514546076"><title>FC2 - Free Communication 2</title><sec id="section79-1352458514546076"><title>FC2.1 Maximal lifetime brain growth (estimated with intracranial volume) predicts disability progression measured with the expanded disability status scale</title><p><underline>JF Sumowski</underline><sup>1</sup>, MA Rocca<sup>2</sup>, VM Leavitt<sup>3</sup>, J Dackovic<sup>4</sup>, S Mesaros<sup>4</sup>, J Drulovic<sup>4</sup>, G Riccitelli<sup>2</sup>, CS Riley<sup>5</sup>, G Comi<sup>2</sup>, M Filippi<sup>2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Kessler Foundation, Neuropsychology and Neuroscience, West Orange, NJ, United States, <sup>2</sup>Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy, <sup>3</sup>Manhattan Memory Center, New York, NY, United States, <sup>4</sup>University of Belgrade, Clinic of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, Belgrade, Serbia, <sup>5</sup>Columbia University Medical Center, Neurology, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Physical disability is prevalent but variable across patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), even among patients with comparable disease burden (e.g., lesion volume). It is therefore difficult to predict future disability for any given patient, which is an obstacle for the science and practice of early intervention / preventative medicine. The brain reserve hypothesis states that larger maximal lifetime brain growth (MLBG; easily estimated with intracranial volume) protects against cognitive disability, but no research has ever investigated whether larger MLBG also protects against physical disability.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We examined whether larger MLBG protects against physical disability within independent cross-sectional and longitudinal samples. That is, we investigated MLBG as a sorely needed, readily available biomarker / predictor of physical disability in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Physical disability was evaluated with the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) in a cross-sectional sample of 240 MS patients (139 women). MRI measured MLBG (estimated with intracranial volume), disease burden (T2 lesion volume, normalized volumes of gray, white, total brain, thalamus, caudate, putamen, cerebellum). Stepwise regression predicted EDSS with demographics, disease burden (above), and MLBG. Next, we investigated whether larger MLBG moderates/attenuates disability progression (EDSS) from baseline to 4.5-year follow-up in an independent longitudinal sample of 40 MS patients (28 women). Finally, we explored whether smaller MLBG may be a risk factor for secondary-progressive (relative to relapsing-remitting) disease course.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Larger MLBG was associated with less physical disability in women (R<sup>2</sup>&#x00394;=.044, p=.004), but not men (p=.737), in our cross-sectional sample. Physical disability progression in our longitudinal sample was moderated by MLBG (p=.008, &#x003b7;<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=.171) whereby patients with larger MLBG suffered less disability progression over time. Finally, MLBG was smaller in women with a secondary-progressive relative to relapsing-remitting course (p=.011).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> We provide the first evidence that larger MLBG provides reserve against physical disability. Consideration of MLBG (easily estimated with intracranial volume) may improve prediction of physical disability progression (i.e., EDSS), which will inform clinical treatment as well as the design, analysis, and interpretation of future research, including clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="section80-1352458514546076"><title>FC2.2 Alemtuzumab improves MRI outcomes in treatment-naive active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis patients: three-year follow-up from CARE-MS I</title><p><underline>DL Arnold</underline><sup>1,2</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>3</sup>, JA Cohen<sup>4</sup>, EJ Fox<sup>5</sup>, KW Selmaj<sup>6</sup>, DH Margolin<sup>7</sup>, J Palmer<sup>7</sup>, E Fisher<sup>8</sup>, on behalf of CARE-MS I Investigators</p><p><sup>1</sup>NeuroRx Research, Montr&#x000e9;al, QC, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Department of Neurology and Neurosurgery, Montr&#x000e9;al Neurological Institute, McGill University, Montr&#x000e9;al, QC, Canada, <sup>3</sup>VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>4</sup>Mellen Center and Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>5</sup>University of Texas Medical Branch, Round Rock, TX, United States, <sup>6</sup>Medical University of &#x00141;&#x000f3;d&#x0017a;, Department of Neurology, &#x00141;&#x000f3;d&#x0017a;, Poland, <sup>7</sup>Genzyme, a Sanofi Company, Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>8</sup>Department of Biomedical Engineering, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> In the phase 3, head-to-head CARE-MS I trial in treatment-naive patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), alemtuzumab had superior efficacy versus subcutaneous interferon beta-1a including the reduction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) activity and brain volume loss over 2 years.

MRI scans were acquired at baseline, and at 1, 2, and 3 years. MRI measurements included proportions of patients with gadolinium (Gd)-enhancing, new or enlarging T<sub>2</sub>-hyperintense, and new T<sub>1</sub>-hypointense lesions; proportion of patients MRI activity-free (absence of Gd-enhancing and T<sub>2</sub> lesions); T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume; and brain volume loss (brain parenchymal fraction change).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> 349 of 376 formerly treatment-naive patients who received alemtuzumab 12 mg in the CARE-MS I core study entered the extension; 63 (18%) received alemtuzumab re-treatment in Year 3. Proportions of patients with new or active lesions were low and did not differ between Years 2 and 3 for Gd-enhancing lesions (7.0% [95% CI: 4.3, 9.6] vs 9.8% [6.6, 13.0]), new/enlarging T<sub>2</sub> lesions (22.2% [17.9, 26.5] vs 27.7% [22.8, 32.6]) or new T<sub>1</sub> lesions (6.7% [4.1, 9.3] vs 10.8% [7.4, 14.1]).

The median rate of brain volume loss decreased progressively over time (Year 0-1: -0.59% [95% CI: -0.75, -0.52], Years 1-2: -0.25% [-0.34, -0.18], Years 2-3: -0.19% [-0.28, -0.08]).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The majority of formerly treatment-naive patients were free of MRI lesion activity in the third year after initiating treatment with alemtuzumab. T<sub>2</sub> and T<sub>1</sub> lesion volume remained below baseline and brain volume loss continued to slow in Year 3.

However, the long elimination half-life of natalizumab may result in persisting PML risk post-discontinuation, a warning of which is included in the product information for natalizumab in Europe.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate characteristics of PML cases in MS patients during treatment with fingolimod following natalizumab discontinuation.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analyzed PML cases retrieved from Novartis safety reporting database for fingolimod.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Exposure of MS patients to fingolimod exceeds 135,800 patient-years as of 28 February 2014. Approximately 15-20% fingolimod treated patients were previously exposed to natalizumab. Eleven natalizumab-associated cases of PML have been reported already; results of CSF JCV PCR were available for 6 patients and positive in 4. Overall, patients (mean age 44.5 years) were exposed to natalizumab for a mean duration of about 4 years (median 5 years). The onset of PML was either confirmed prior to switch (in retrospect) or occurred within 6 months after switch to fingolimod in all cases (median 75 days). One additional case (no previous natalizumab exposure) was reported as PML after 7 months of fingolimod treatment; clinical features and MRI evolution were consistent with neuromyelitis optica; the PML diagnosis was made based on the results of CSF showing low copy number of JCV.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Vigilance for PML is warranted following natalizumab discontinuation, especially in patients who may be at increased risk (JCV antibody positive, prior exposure to immunosuppressants and long-term [&#x0003e;24 months] natalizumab exposure). Baseline neurological examination and MRI scan before initiating fingolimod may assist, at least retrospectively, in attribution of causality to natalizumab versus fingolimod. Experience with more than 91,500 patients treated with fingolimod thus far does not indicate a PML risk attributable to fingolimod.</p></sec><sec id="section86-1352458514546076"><title>FC3.2 GLACIER: open-label, randomized safety/tolerability study of glatiramer acetate 40mg/mL three times weekly versus 20mg/mL daily in RRMS</title><p><underline>JS Wolinsky</underline><sup>1</sup>, DW Dietrich<sup>2</sup>, TE Borresen<sup>3</sup>, BF Gilder<sup>4</sup>, JR Steinerman<sup>5</sup>, Y Sidi<sup>6</sup>, A Vainstein<sup>6</sup>, S Kolodny<sup>7</sup>, V Knappertz<sup>5,8</sup>, GLACIER Study Group</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>2</sup>Advanced Neurological Specialists, Great Falls, MT, United States, <sup>3</sup>Mecklenburg Neurological Associates, Charlotte, NC, United States, <sup>4</sup>Swedish Medical Center, Littleton, CO, United States, <sup>5</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Frazer, PA, United States, <sup>6</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Netanya, Israel, <sup>7</sup>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>8</sup>Heinrich-Heine Universit&#x000e4;t D&#x000fc;sseldorf, D&#x000fc;sseldorf, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Improving injection tolerability and patient (pt) experience will support adherence to safe, effective RRMS treatments (Tx) such as glatiramer acetate (GA).

Estriol is an estrogen which gradually increases during pregnancy, reaching high levels in the last trimester. Beneficial effects of estrogen treatment, including estriol, have included both anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective mechanisms in MS models. In a recently completed Phase II trial in women with relapsing remitting MS (RRMS), relapse rates were decreased in subjects treated with the combination of estriol plus glatiramer acetate as compared to placebo plus glatiramer acetate. Treatment was safe and well tolerated.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> Given the known neuroprotective effects of estrogens in nonMS conditions, particularly as related to cognition, secondary outcomes in the completed trial were investigated for effects of treatment on cognitive and other MS disabilities.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Analyses of secondary endpoints were done on data from a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled (1:1) trial of oral estriol 8 mg per day in RRMS women, age 18-50 years. Estriol was an add-on therapy. Thus, all subjects began glatiramer acetate injections within 2 months or less of randomization and received either estriol versus placebo pills to take in combination. Treatment duration was 2 years. The primary endpoint was annualized relapse rate.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The estriol plus glatiramer acetate group as compared to the placebo plus glatiramer acetate group had improved cognitive testing scores after 12 months of treatment as demonstrated by the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT).

Effects on the Selective Reminding Test and the Spatial Recall Test were examined in the context of effects on the PASAT. Trends for improvement in the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) were seen at 24 months in the estriol plus glatiramer acetate group, but not in the placebo plus glatiramer acetate group.

Unfortunately no or very few treatment possibilities are available for patients with PPMS and SPMS. Methylprednisolone (MP) dampens inflammation and crosses the blood-brain barrier; hence, we hypothesised that treatment of progressive MS patients with pulsed oral MP would lower intrathecal inflammation, demyelination and axonal loss.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pulsed oral MP as treatment for progressive multiple sclerosis.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> The study was carried out as a single center, open-label phase 2A, proof-of-concept study; 15 PPMS and 15 SPMS patients received pulsed oral MP (500 mg QD) for 3 days every 4 weeks for 60 weeks. Written informed consent was obtained from all study participants before inclusion and the study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01305837. The primary outcome measure was change in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of osteopontin (OPN) (a marker of intrathecal inflammation); secondary outcome measures were changes in CSF concentrations of neurofilament light chain (NfL) and other markers of inflammation and demyelination. Furthermore, we evaluated changes in MRI measures, clinical measures and motor evoked potentials (MEP). Safety measures were adverse events (AE) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans for monitoring bone mineral density (BMD).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We found no significant change in the CSF concentration of OPN or NfL after 60 weeks of treatment. We observed some significant improvement in clinical scores. MTR values for normal appearing white matter (NAWM), grey matter (GM) and lesions increased significantly and we found a significant decrease in mean diffusivity for both NAWM and GM. No change was detected in MEP. Known side effects of steroid treatment were common adverse events, but there were no severe AEs considered to be related to treatment. A slight, but significant increase was seen in T-score of the lumbar spine, p=0.022, indicating a higher BMD.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Treatment with pulsed MP was safe in patients with progressive MS but had no beneficial effect on primary outcomes in the CSF markers of neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. However, secondary MRI parameters suggest some effect on tissue integrity.</p></sec><sec id="section89-1352458514546076"><title>FC3.5 Long-term follow-up of the effect of delayed-release dimethyl fumarate on no evident disease activity in patients with multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>G Giovannoni</underline><sup>1</sup>, R Gold<sup>2</sup>, RJ Fox<sup>3</sup>, L Kappos<sup>4</sup>, T Phillips<sup>5</sup>, A Zhang<sup>6</sup>, NC Kurukulasuriya<sup>6</sup>, E Havrdova<sup>7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Queen Mary University of London, Blizard Institute, Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry, London, United Kingdom, <sup>2</sup>St. Josef Hospital, Ruhr University, Bochum, Germany, <sup>3</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis Treatment and Research, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>4</sup>University Hospital, Basel Neurology, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>5</sup>Baylor Institute for Immunology Research, Multiple Sclerosis Program, Dallas, TX, United States, <sup>6</sup>Biogen Idec Inc., Cambridge, MA, United States, <sup>7</sup>Charles University, Department of Neurology, First Faculty of Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) demonstrated efficacy and safety in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) in the Phase 3 DEFINE and CONFIRM studies.

Those initially randomized to placebo (PBO) or glatiramer acetate (GA) were re-randomized in ENDORSE to either delayed-release DMF BID or TID. Patients were assessed annually and those fulfilling the following criteria were considered to have NEDA: no relapses, no 24-week Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) sustained progression, no gadolinium-enhancing lesions, and no new or enlarging T2 hyperintense lesions.

MCAM is strongly up-regulated in human on CD8<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes during MS relapses, while immunomodulatory treatments decrease MCAM expression.

Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>5</sup>University of California San Francisco, Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, San Francisco, CA, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> MR phase imaging is a novel imaging methodology used to characterize multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions<sup>1</sup>. However, its contrast mechanism is unclear. The speculation that the source of phase contrast is iron accumulation has been challenged by recent studies<sup>2-3</sup> which suggest that myelin/axonal integrity could also contribute to changes in phase shifts. Changes in myelin/axonal integrity may be indicated by N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) level, which is measured using MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). Therefore MRSI may provide evidence to support the hypothesis that degenerative in addition to inflammatory processes affect phase contrast in MS lesions.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To study the correlation between the phase shift and NAA level in MS lesions.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> MRI was performed on a GE 7T scanner. Phase images were obtained using a 2D gradient echo sequence and reconstructed using a previous method<sup>1</sup>. The parameters of the sequence were as follows: TE/TR=12/250ms, resolution=0.46x0.46x3mm, and 22 slices. MRSI was obtained using a spin echo slice selection with TE/TR=20/2000ms, resolution=1cc and spectra array= 18x22x8. The spectra were reconstructed using in-house software<sup>4</sup> and quantified by LCModel. MS lesions were defined on T2-weighted images that had been registered to phase images. Thirteen lesions (volume&#x0003e;1cc) were retrospectively selected from 6 relapsing MS patients enrolled in a Phase III trial of ocrelizumab (Roche ORCHESTRA programs). For each lesion, a single MRSI voxel was selected and measured for NAA level (peak area normalized by the average value from 7 normal volunteers) and mean phase shift (with vein excluded). The Spearman correlation between NAA level and phase shift was calculated.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The average (standard deviation) of normalized NAA concentration and mean phase shift from 13 lesions were 0.65 (0.20) and 0.19Hz (0.36Hz), respectively. NAA concentration was inversely correlated with phase shift (p = 0.039, Spearman rho = &#x02212;0.58).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold>
<italic>We found NAA to be inversely correlated with mean phase shift within MS lesions, supporting the recent hypothesis that both myelin/axonal integrity and iron contribute to phase contrast with opposite signs.</italic></p><p><bold>References</bold></p><p>1.

Cholesterol is also a precursor of vitamin D, and a recent study showed associations between cholesterol and vitamin D on the biomarker level in MS as well. High serum cholesterol is furthermore related to several characteristic changes in MS, including reduced retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, lower baseline brain volume and increased lesion numbers at follow-up. Cholesterol has a brain specific metabolite, 24S-hydroxycholesterol, whose serum levels are decreased in MS and correlate to brain volume as a reflection of disease progression. Moreover, serum levels of this oxysterol change before the appearance of clinical signs and changes in cholesterol precursors in the acute EAE animal model. Thus, there are multiple lines of evidence to suggest that cholesterol homeostasis is affected in MS.</p><p>Treatment of EAE animals with the cholesterol lowering statins has lead to positive effects, though results from clinical trials seem disappointing. The positive effects of statins in animal models may be through immunomodulation rather than via cholesterol lowering, since statins have pleiotrophic effects, i.e. also on T-lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells. Treatment with statins will anyway affect the already disturbed cholesterol homeostasis in MS. Moreover, clear negative effects of statins on process outgrowth and branching of oligodendrocyte remyelination have been reported. It therefore seems that positive effects of statins on immunomodulation are not outweighed by their negative effect on cholesterol homeostasis.</p><p>Thus, cholesterol and related compounds can be measured as body fluid biomarkers to monitor or predict pathological changes in MS. Moreover, these body fluid sterols should be used as safety biomarkers to monitor changes in cholesterol homeostasis during treatments potentially affecting this pathway.</p></sec><sec id="section98-1352458514546076"><title>PS7.2 Biomarkers of treatment response to MS disease therapies</title><p><underline>S Dhib-Jalbut</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, New Brunswick, NJ, United States</p><p>Clinical response to DMTs in MS is variable.

When released from activated immune cells or dying cells during necrosis or apoptosis, HMGB1 may drive pro-inflammatory responses through binding to cell-surface receptors such as the receptor of advanced glycation end-products, Toll-like receptors (TLR) 2 and 9, and the intracellular receptor TLR-9. Recent studies have shown associations between HMGB1 and autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Sj&#x000f6;gren&#x02019;s syndrome. In multiple sclerosis (MS), HMGB1 expression was found to be up-regulated in brain active lesions from patients. In the animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), neutralization of HMGB1 ameliorated clinical severity and EAE pathology in the central nervous system. Studies of HMGB1 in peripheral blood from MS patients are lacking.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We aimed to investigate the role of HMGB1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from MS patients with different clinical forms of the disease.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Gene expression levels of HMGB1 were determined by real time PCR in PBMC of 29 healthy controls (HC) and 57 untreated MS patients (25 with relapsing-remitting MS - RRMS; 14 with secondary progressive MS - SPMS; and 18 with primary progressive MS - PPMS). Serum levels of HMGB1 were measured by ELISA in 18 HC and 37 untreated MS patients (12 with RRMS; 15 with SPMS; and 10 with PPMS).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> mRNA expression levels for HMGB1 were significantly increased in PBMC from the whole MS group compared with HC (p=0.036). Further stratification of the MS group into different clinical forms revealed a significant increase in HMGB1 expression by PBMC from patients with relapse-onset MS compared to PPMS (p=0.0003 for RRMS and p=0.003 for SPMS) and the control group (p=0.002 for RRMS and p=0.03 for SPMS). Serum levels of HMGB1 were also found to be elevated in patients with relapse-onset MS compared to the PPMS group (p=0.001 for RRMS and p=0.03 for SPMS). Levels of HMGB1 in serum were also increased in RRMS patients compared with HC (p=0.007).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These results point to a role of HMGB1 in patients with RRMS and SPMS.

Activated microglia and macrophages upregulate expression of the 18kDa translocator protein (TSPO), which can be imaged in vivo with [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28, a second generation TSPO ligand.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To assess the presence of activated microglia and macrophages within different lesional and non-lesional brain tissue compartments in MS by combining [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 PET imaging with 7 Tesla (T) MRI.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Seven MS patients (5 SPMS and 2 RRMS) and 7 healthy controls (HC) matched for age, gender and TSPO affinity binding underwent 90 minutes of [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 imaging on a high resolution Siemens BrainPET scanner. Anatomical MR images were simultaneously acquired for FreeSurfer cortical surface reconstruction and MR-PET image registration. In each subject, standardized uptake value (SUV) maps were created for 60 to 90-minute PET frame (1.25 mm<sup>3</sup> isotropic resolution). Lesions were segmented from T2*-weighted images (0.33&#x000d7;0.33&#x000d7;1 mm<sup>3</sup>) acquired on a separate 7T MRI session: WM lesions in all MS subjects; cortical (reaching the pial surface) and leukocortical (extending across GM and WM without reaching the pial surface) lesions in 3 SPMS subjects. Lesion, cortical sulci and gyri masks were co-registered to each [<sup>11</sup>C]-PBR28 map to extract SUVs. In HC, SUVs were obtained in the cortex (sulci and gyri) and in WM. SUVs were compared between patients and HC using a paired t-test.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Relative to HC, in patients there was a ~24% increase in SUVs (mean&#x000b1;SD) in NAWM (MS=0.711&#x000b1;0.2; HC=0.575&#x000b1;0.1), a ~11% increase in lesional WM (MS=0.641&#x000b1;0.2), ~20% increase in cortical sulci (MS=0.784&#x000b1;0.2; HC=0.653&#x000b1;0.1), and 13% increase in cortical gyri (MS=0.769&#x000b1;0.2; HC=0.679&#x000b1;0.1). In patients, increase in SUVs reached statistical significance relative to HC for NAWM (p&#x0003c; 0.03) and cortical sulci (p&#x0003c; 0.05). SPMS subjects showed, relative to RRMS, a 17%, 23%, 20% and 14% increase in lesional WM, NAWM, cortical sulci and gyri, respectively. There was no difference between lesional and non-lesional cortical SUVs.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> High resolution [<sup>11</sup>C]PBR28 MR-PET imaging is a promising tool for assessing in vivo microglia and macrophages activation within brain tissue compartments in MS including NAWM and cortical sulci.

Available quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods are not ideal to quantify axon and myelin integrity in the presence of inflammation.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To address the limitations of available MRI methods, we developed diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) to differentiate and quantify axonal injury, demyelination, and inflammation. To validate DBSI, we examined the correlation between DBSI biomarkers and quantified histology images using autopsied MS specimens. To assess clinical feasibility, we applied DBSI to characterize the pathologies underlying various lesion types in MS patients.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> DBSI models axons as anisotropic diffusion tensors, and models cells and edema as isotropic tensors of varying diffusivities (low for cells, higher for edema). Silver, Luxol Fast Blue (LFB), and H&#x00026;E stains were down-sampled and rigid-registered to MR images. Positive stains were extracted and quantified based on the color features. Clustered linear models were used to describe the correlation between quantitative histology and DBSI maps. White matter lesions [6 black holes (BH), 6 non-black holes (NBH), and 4 Gadolinium-enhanced (Gd+)] were labeled based on MPRAGE, T1W and FLAIR to compare the ability of DBSI vs. diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to distinguish lesion types.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Silver stains correlated well with DBSI Fiber ratio (r=0.65) and DBSI axial diffusivity (AD) (r=0.59), and weakly with DTI AD (r=0.23). LFB stains correlated better with DBSI radial diffusivity (RD) (r=0.68) than DTI RD (r=0.52). In addition, cells enumerated by H&#x00026;E correlated strongly with DBSI restricted isotropic fraction (r=0.89), consistent with our prior findings in an animal model of MS.</p><p>All p&#x0003c; = 10<sup>-4</sup>. A 6% increase of DBSI restricted isotropic ratio was observed in Gd+ lesions as compared to 6% and 4% decrease in BH and NBH respectively, in accord with active inflammation being a distinctive feature of Gd+ lesions. DBSI also found more severe axonal injury (decreased AD: -0.28 vs. -0.1 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>/ms), demyelination (increased RD: 0.14 vs. 0.1 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup>/ms), and edema (increased extra-axonal water 44% vs. 18%) in BH than NBH.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> DBSI-derived quantitative biomarkers were specific and consistent with histology.

The evidence and experience rapidly generated with new drugs is phenomenal, precluding strong recommendations on given treatment algorithms. Evidence indicates that presence of inflammation: relapses and/or new T2 or enhancing lesions, in patients on interferon beta (IFN) or glatiramer acetate (GA) is associated to poor long term prognosis (Rudick et al, Rio et al). Also there are inconclusive data trying to establish a relation between drug effects on brain atrophy and eventual benefit. Therefore, proper identification of inflammation and disability progression is nowadays most important for MS neurologists. In fact, the new phenotype classification takes activity and progression as key patient classification items (Lublin et al).</p><p>It can be argued that higher numbers of follow-up visits and MR exams can increase the number of inflammatory events identified. Typically, an MR exam every 6-12 months is recommended, although great variability occurs in different clinical practice. Although in theory the objective of full supression of inflammation may be desirable, evidence indicates it is probably unrealistic and even unnecessary. Some require relapses and new MR lesions to consider switching and others only new MR lesions.</p><p>Patients with mild inflammation on IFN or GA may switch transversally or to orals (teriflunomide (TFM), dimethyl fumarate (DFT) or fingolimod (FGD)). Patients with higher inflammation tend to be treated with the second line drugs -as they are tagged in EU: fingolimod and natalizumab (NTZ). Also, alemtuzumab (ALZ) is now an option on inflammation. Other compassionate drug uses occur in some clinical practices like rituximab. There are many switching possibilities, but evidence is still limited.</p><p>Nature of the drug may influence future options mainly for safety. For instance. using TFM or FGD may influence the risk of PML if NTZ is used later. Washout period is also important. No washout is recommended after or before IFN or GA. After NTZ a period of at least 1-2 months is recommended to start FGD or DFT. Other periods are speculative.</p><p>There are many other factors to be taken into account when switching: concomitant disorders, age, pregnancy, JCV status, etc. Cost and accessibility are now two very important factors in decision making and vary hugely between countries.</p></sec><sec id="section113-1352458514546076"><title>PS9.3 Efficacy and safety of oral versus intravenous high-dose methylprednisolone in multiple sclerosis relapses, a randomized double blind trial (COPOUSEP)</title><p><underline>E Le Page</underline><sup>1</sup>, D Veillard<sup>2</sup>, D Laplaud<sup>3</sup>, R Wardi<sup>4</sup>, C Lebrun<sup>5</sup>, F Zagnoli<sup>6</sup>, S Wiertlewki<sup>3</sup>, V Deburghgraeve<sup>1</sup>, M Coustans<sup>7</sup>, G Edan<sup>1</sup>, West Neurosciences Network of Excellence (WENNE)</p><p><sup>1</sup>University Hospital Pontchaillou, Neurosciences, Rennes, France, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital Pontchaillou, Epidemiology &#x00026; Public Health, Rennes, France, <sup>3</sup>University Hospital, Neurosciences, Nantes, France, <sup>4</sup>General Hospital, Neurosciences, St Brieuc, France, <sup>5</sup>General Hospital, Neurosciences, Nice, France, <sup>6</sup>Army Hospital, Neurosciences, Brest, France, <sup>7</sup>General Hospital, Neurosciences, Quimper, France</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Intravenous (IV) high-dose Methylprednisolone (MP) for 3-5 days are recommended to accelerate Multiple Sclerosis (MS) relapses recovery.

Presence of Gd lesions at year 1 increased the risk of CDMS (HR 3.29; [2.18- 4.97]).

Every 5 years of age older at CIS was associated with a 10% reduction in the risk of relapse (Hazard Ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.88, 0.92). Patients managed in Dutch clinics were associated with higher rates of second attack compared with other locations. Any exposure to DMT was associated with a 42% reduction in the relapse rate compared with DMT-na&#x000ef;ve patients (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.46, 0.73) whilst increasing proportion of follow-up time on DMD was associated with a 65% reduction in the rate of relapse (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.25, 0.49). At least 1 T1 gadolinium enhancing lesion was associated with 1.29 times the relapse rate (95% CI 1.14, 1.47). At least 1 infratentorial and at least 1 juxtacortical lesion on cerebral MRI were associated with 1.29 and 1.16 times the rate of second attack respectively. The presence of oligoclonal bands on baseline CSF examination was associated with 1.43 times the rate of subsequent relapse compared with absence of OCB (HR 1.43, 95% CI 1.15, 1.77).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> This large prospective study suggests that DMD exposure, age at CIS onset, country, MRI lesion load and the oligoclonal bands on CSF examination are all independently associated with the probability and timing of second attack. Early identification of patients who are at risk of conversion to CDMS based on demographic and disease characteristics may enable the clinician to closely monitor such patients and consider early treatment intervention which may result in better patient outcomes. To our knowledge, our study is the largest to prospectively assess patients in clinical practice from CIS onset.</p></sec><sec id="section116-1352458514546076"><title>PS9.6 Early on-treatment T2 and T1 subtraction MRI predicts imaging and clinical outcomes in the CombiRx cohort</title><p><underline>L Freeman</underline><sup>1</sup>, F Lalys<sup>1</sup>, TD Staewen<sup>2</sup>, JA Lincoln<sup>1</sup>, F Nelson<sup>1</sup>, S Datta<sup>2</sup>, PA Narayana<sup>2</sup>, SS Cofield<sup>3</sup>, T Gustafson<sup>4</sup>, GR Cutter<sup>3</sup>, FD Lublin<sup>4</sup>, JS Wolinsky<sup>1</sup>, CombiRx Investigators</p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Texas Health Science Center, Neurology, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>2</sup>University of Texas Health Science Center, Diagnostic and Interventional Imaging, Houston, TX, United States, <sup>3</sup>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Biostatistics, Birmingham, TX, United States, <sup>4</sup>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, Corinne Goldsmith Dickinson Center for Multiple Sclerosis, Department of Neurology &#x00026; Friedman Brain Institute, New York, NY, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Estimates of cross-sectional lesion burden show only modest correlation with disability in MS.

Serial co-registered sets of fully processed T2 and T1 images were used to perform sMRI between 6 months (M6)-baseline(M0) and between 12 months (M12)-M0. The volume of new and vanished T2 lesion voxels was calculated as well as the volume of persistent black holes (PBH). Multivariable modeling controlling for confounding factors was used to estimate the association between whole brain sMRI changes and 1) clinical outcomes at 36 months: EDSS, clinical activity free status (CAFS), disease activity free status (DAFS) and on-trial sustained progression, and 2) subsequent MRI changes in T1 and T2 lesion volumes (T1Lv, T2Lv), burden of disease (BOD), grey and white matter volume (GMv, WMv) and normalized cerebrospinal fluid volume (nCSF).

Studies in human MS have identified abundant deposition of the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen throughout the course of disease, not only in active and chronic plaques, but also in early lesions prior to demyelination. In accordance, proteomic analysis has revealed increased coagulation activity in MS plaques. However, whether plasma proteins and the coagulation cascade contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal damage remains poorly understood. Our laboratory identified fibrinogen as a key player in the activation of CNS innate immunity and induction of axonal damage in neuroinflammation. We showed that fibrinogen is a potent pro-inflammatory mediator in the nervous system by activating the CD11b/CD18 integrin receptor (also known as Mac-1 and complement receptor 3) in microglial cells. Using in vivo two-photon microscopy, we showed that in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis (EAE), a model of MS, microglia rapidly perform constant surveillance of blood vessel walls and specifically cluster around blood vessels with fibrin deposition. By developing a novel molecular probe to detect coagulation activity in the CNS, we demonstrated in EAE early activation of coagulation and fibrin deposition even before disease onset. Intriguingly, fibrin is sufficient to induce in microglia release of reactive oxygen species, which contribute to neurodegeneration. Pharmacologic or genetic disruption of the fibrin/CD11b interaction suppresses microglial cluster formation, neurologic symptoms, inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage in EAE. Overall, our studies identified the blood coagulation factor fibrinogen as a novel activator of CNS innate immunity that promotes neurodegeneration. Fibrin has the potential for selective drug targeting to suppress its damaging functions in the nervous system without affecting its beneficial effects in hemostasis. Fibrin-selective inhibition of innate immunity may offer novel strategies to combat axonal damage in neuroinflammatory disease.</p></sec><sec id="section120-1352458514546076"><title>PS10.3 Demyelinating lesions in multiple sclerosis: experimental evidence indicating why, how and where they may form</title><p>RA Desai<sup>1</sup>, AL Davies<sup>1</sup>, M Kasti<sup>1</sup>, F Laulund<sup>1</sup>, <underline>KJ Smith</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>UCL Institute of Neurology, Neuroinflammation, London, United Kingdom</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Pathological studies have distinguished a &#x0201c;primary&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;pre-phagocytic&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Pattern III&#x0201d; demyelinating lesion in MS, but the mechanism(s) responsible for the initiation of this early lesion remain unclear.

Surprisingly, this lesion is not centred on the injection site, as typically occurs, but rather it forms at the border between the white and grey matter, extending to the watershed region at the base of the dorsal columns. Histological examination of the spinal cord during the first days after lesion induction revealed that the grey matter and dorsal columns at the site of injection were severely hypoxic: oligodendrocytes labelled particularly strongly. The precise site that later became demyelinated also labelled strongly for the overlapping production of superoxide and nitric oxide, with immunoreactivity for nitrotyrosine indicating the presence of the strong oxidant peroxynitrite. The location of the demyelinating lesion corresponded with a watershed region of inherent susceptibility to hypoxia, as revealed by exposure of na&#x000ef;ve animals to a hypoxic environment. Oligodendrocytes succumbed in this region, resulting in the subsequent Pattern III demyelination.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> The evidence shows that Pattern III demyelination arises from activation of innate immune mechanisms that result in an environment characterised by hypoxia, and reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The coincident presence of these factors at sites rendered vulnerable by the vascular architecture results in oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination and some axonal degeneration. Similar mechanisms may be responsible for the initiation of Pattern III lesions in multiple sclerosis.</p></sec><sec id="section121-1352458514546076"><title>PS10.4 Molecular characterisation and suppressive capacity of human CD4+HLA-G+ regulatory T cells</title><p><underline>T Ruck</underline><sup>1</sup>, S Pankratz<sup>1</sup>, S Bittner<sup>1</sup>, AM Herrmann<sup>1</sup>, SG Meuth<sup>1,2</sup>, H Wiendl<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Muenster, Neurology, Muenster, Germany, <sup>2</sup>University of Muenster, Institute of Physiology I - Neuropathophysiology, Muenster, Germany</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Regulatory T cells (Treg) are essential for the induction and maintenance of peripheral immune tolerance.

The neocortex is typically affected by several different lesion types, but gray matter demyelination may also be found in non-(neo)cortical areas such as the hippocampus, thalamus, basal ganglia, cerebellar cortex and the spinal cord gray matter. Demyelination may be extensive, with cerebellar cortical demyelination affecting up to 90% of the total surface area in some published cases. Clinical correlates of demyelination in the gray matter have been more difficult to study, as conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques were insufficiently equipped to visualize gray matter lesions. Newer techniques, like double inversion recovery (DIR) and phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR), as well as imaging at higher field-strengths, have improved lesion detection. Nevertheless, correlations between cortical lesions and clinical disability, including cognitive impairment, remained moderate at best. Gray matter atrophy, which develops largely independently of (overt) gray matter demyelination, might be a better (and more reliable) imaging candidate for explaining clinicocognitive disability and progression. Atrophy of the neocortex is initially seen in temporal and prefrontal cortical regions, and the earliest signs of atrophy of the gray matter are found in deep gray matter structures such as the thalamus. In terms of explaining cognition, pathology of the thalamus and of (anterior) tracts emanating from the thalamus may play an important role. Given the &#x02039;centrality&#x0203a; of this structure in the brain&#x0203a;s overall network, advanced network analysis may be expected to provide new and crucial insight into cognitive impairment and decline in MS.</p></sec><sec id="section126-1352458514546076"><title>PS11.2 Is primary progressive MS a distinct disease?</title><p><underline>S Vukusic</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>H&#x000f4;pital Neurologique, Bron cedex, France</p><p>Primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) represents 10 to 15% of patients with MS.

The total number of neocortical neurons (TNNN) was calculated as N<sub>V</sub> x V<sub>REF</sub> in each slab, where N<sub>V</sub>= neurons counted/volume of dissectors quantified and V<sub>REF</sub>= AOI x slab thickness (t), adjusted for tissue shrinkage, and multiplied by 2.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> TNNN was 14.1 &#x000b1; 2.9 billion in MS and 23.6 &#x000b1; 3.1 billion in controls brains (p= 0.078), suggesting an overall neuronal loss of 40%. Strong correlation was detected between TNNN and cortical volume (r= 0.85, p= 0.0082). All brains were quantified using the same frequency of dissectors (mean &#x000b1; SEM, MS= 466 &#x000b1; 37; controls= 464 &#x000b1; 24, p = 0.95).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> MS affects the entire CNS. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to accurately estimate neuronal loss throughout the MS cortex. The mean TNNN in our (male) controls was very similar to figures previously reported. The apparent 40% reduction of neocortical neurons in pwMS is biased by the fact that 4 out of 5 pwMS were women whilst our control cases were all men. However, the previously reported TNNN in women is 21.4 billion, thus 34% higher than our TNNN in pwMS. Though requiring confirmation in a larger and more balanced cohort, this data shows the loss of functionally important brain cells is massive and suggests strong correlation of TNNN with neocortical volume loss.</p></sec><sec id="section129-1352458514546076"><title>PS11.5 Complement activation is associated with synaptic alterations in the multiple sclerosis hippocampus</title><p><underline>I Michailidou</underline><sup>1</sup>, JGP Willems<sup>1,2</sup>, E-J Kooi<sup>3</sup>, C van Eden<sup>2</sup>, JJG Geurts<sup>3</sup>, F Baas<sup>1</sup>, I Huitinga<sup>2</sup>, V Ramaglia<sup>1,2</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Academic Medical Center, Department of Genome Analysis, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>2</sup>Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience, Department of Neuroimmunology, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>3</sup>VU University Medical Center, Department of Anatomy and Neurosciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Deterioration of memory function in multiple sclerosis (MS) has been associated with demyelination, loss of synapses and decreased neuronal proteins essential to synaptic plasticity and neurotransmission. The molecular basis of these synaptic alterations is unknown. Accumulating evidence suggest that components of the complement system, C1q and C3, can mediate elimination of synapses in the developing or neurodegenerating brain.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To identify evidence of complement activation in relation to demyelination and synaptic alterations in the human MS hippocampus.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We analysed the expression and localization of C1q and C3 in myelinated and demyelinated hippocampi from post-mortem brains of MS donors with progressive disease, in relation to neuropathological changes, and compared the findings to hippocampus tissue of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) donors and non-neurological controls.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> We detected substantial axonal, synaptic and neuronal alterations in both, myelinated and demyelinated MS hippocampi, as detected by loss of SMI312-positive axons and synaptophysin-positive synapses, and increased mitochondrial heat shock protein 70-positive neurons, compared to non-neurological controls. Protein expression of C1q was increased in the MS hippocampus compared to non-neurological controls and localized at neurons and synapses with neurons being the major source of <italic>C1qA</italic> mRNA, as shown by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. The extent of C3 activation was comparable between myelinated and demyelinated MS, as shown by the substantial consumption of intact C3 compared to non-neurological controls. Deposition of the C3 activation product, C3d, was detected at neurons and synapses. In addition, C1q co-localized with HLA-positive cell processes, suggesting engulfment of C1q-positive synapses by microglia. Further, a significant correlation between C1q and synapses was seen in the myelinated MS hippocampi with progressive disease. Notably, hippocampi from patients with relapsing remitting disease had reduced amounts of C1q and C3d compared to progressive donors. Moreover, MS hippocampi were consistently negative for the terminal complement activation complex (C5b9) in contrast to AD hippocampi, which showed C1q, C3d and C5b9 deposition at amyloid plaques.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> These data support a demyelination-independent mechanism of synaptic alterations in MS and suggest an involvement of the C1q-C3 complement axis to hippocampal pathology in progressive disease.</p></sec><sec id="section130-1352458514546076"><title>PS11.6 A link between neuronal degeneration and white matter demyelination in multiple sclerosis: vascular supply</title><p><underline>L Haider</underline><sup>1</sup>, T Zrzavy<sup>1</sup>, S Hametner<sup>1</sup>, H Lassmann<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Medical University of Vienna, Center for Brain Research, Neuroimmunology, Vienna, Austria</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Magnetic resonance imaging derived data suggest grey matter atrophy to be a localized phenomenon of deep grey matter and certain cortical areas.

The Knowledge Program (KP) - was instituted within the Cleveland Clinic Neurological Institute. Each patient completes a set of validated functional status measures and patient reported outcomes prior to their clinic visit. MS patients complete the EQ5D, PHQ9, and MSPS. Data is available in the EHR for use during the patient visit, and simultaneously entered into a research database. KP has gained widespread support by clinicians and patients. Data from 20,000 patient visits per year has been collected, supporting a variety of clinical research studies. The Multiple Sclerosis Performance Test (MSPT) - was developed to provide quantitative neuroperformance data in a cost-efficient way. The MSPT, which runs on an iPad, consists of a number of tests designed to simulate the MSFC. iPad based testing was compared with traditional technician-based testing in 51 MS patients and 49 HCs, and shown to be valid, based on test-retest precision, correlation between iPad and technician based testing, sensitivity to MS and MS severity, and correlation with patient-reported outcomes (in press, Rudick, et al. Journal of Visual Experimentation, 2014). The MSPT can be self-administered, eliminating the need for clinician or technician testing.</p><p>For real world studies, new methods will be required to obtain reliable, meaningful, patient-centered data from patients participating in health care. The examples presented here can enable such data collection by using technology, and by placing the patient at the center of data collection, freeing up the clinician to spend their time discussing patient concerns, and making medical decisions, as opposed to collecting outcomes data. Patient reports and neuroperformance measures could then be combined with quantitative MRI data, integrated, and presented to the clinician using visualization software. Graphical user interfaces demonstrating an individual patient, contextualized to reference populations will enable individualized assessements, which in turn can be used for data-driven medical decisions. Systems to integrate, visualize, and contextualize the data will be illustrated. Ultimately, methods of this sort will transform the patient experience and simultaneously enable real world research.</p></sec><sec id="section133-1352458514546076"><title>PS12.2 Pragmatic clinical trials and observational studies</title><p><underline>M Trojano</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Neuroscience and Sense Organs, Department of Basic Medical Sciences, Bari, Italy</p><p>In the complex scenario of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) treatment, studies addressing strategies to achieve a &#x0201c;personalized treatment&#x0201d; are becoming imperative. Results from both experimental studies, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and pragmatic clinical trials (PCTs), and non-experimental studies, as retrospective and prospective non randomised observational trials (NROTs), are needed because each of these studies answers to different research questions. The purpose of traditional RCT is to answer the question &#x0201c;Can an intervention work under ideal conditions?&#x0201d; However data from RCTs do not always reflect real-world practice and outcomes and they cannot necessarily be assumed to apply to subpopulations not studied in those RCTs. The PCT is the best method for understanding the effectiveness of that therapy in the full spectrum of everyday clinical settings. The research question under investigation is &#x0201c;Can an intervention actually work in real life?&#x0201d;. PCTs are usually prospective, randomised studies and, as opposed to RCTs, use active comparators of the same or different class, broader inclusion criteria, large and diverse patient populations, and a wide spectrum of clinically relevant health outcomes mostly patient-centered. Therefore, PCTs overcome many limitations of RCTs, producing results that can be generalized and applied in routine practice settings. NROTs and registry studies are conducted in situations where experimental research is impractical or not feasible. In these study designs intervention is at the choice of doctors and patients. They include large populations who can potentially benefit from a treatment, or subgroups not typically included in initial RCTs, such as pregnant women, children, or patients with multiple co-morbidities and concomitant medications. Follow-up duration can be long to encompass delayed risks and long-term benefits of a drug and/or of various combinations and sequencing of treatments. They address practical questions such as &#x0201c;Which interventions are most effective for which patients under which circumstances?&#x0201d; The current availability of several worldwide MS registries collecting data on MS treatments represents a unique opportunity for NROTs. This presentation will focus on the value and future roles of various study types and emerging data sources in providing useful information to help physicians in the complex decision-making process of the treatment choice for MS patients.</p></sec><sec id="section134-1352458514546076"><title>PS12.3 Defining brain volume cut-offs to predict disability progression in MS: an analysis of a large cohort of relapsing-remitting MS patients</title><p><underline>MP Sormani</underline><sup>1</sup>, L Kappos<sup>2</sup>, EW Radue<sup>3</sup>, J Cohen<sup>4</sup>, F Barkhof<sup>5</sup>, T Sprenger<sup>2,3</sup>, D Piani Meier<sup>6</sup>, D H&#x000e4;ring<sup>6</sup>, D Tomic<sup>6</sup>, N De Stefano<sup>7</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Genoa, Genoa, Italy, <sup>2</sup>University Hospital, Department of Neurology, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>3</sup>Medical Image Analysis Center (MIAC), University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>4</sup>Cleveland Clinic, Neurological Institute, Cleveland, OH, United States, <sup>5</sup>VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands, <sup>6</sup>Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland, <sup>7</sup>University of Siena, Siena, Italy</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Brain volume loss (BVL) correlates with the risk of disability progression in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) at a group level.

Patients were classified into three groups based on the differences between observed and expected NBV values: Medium BV (M-NBV): within &#x000b1; 1 standard deviation (SD), Low BV (L-BV) : &#x0003e; 1 SD below mean and High NBV (H-NBV) :&#x0003e; 1 SD above mean.

In the placebo group (n=770), patients with H-NBV had the lowest risk of disability progression over 2 years (16%), followed by M-NBV patients (24%) and patients with L-NBV (31%) (HR=1.5 test for trend, p=0.01). A significant effect of fingolimod treatment on disability progression was seen in patients with M-NBV (-38%, p&#x0003c; 0.001) and L-NBV (-50%, p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Individualized cut-offs derived from baseline NBV values adjusted for patients clinical and demographic characteristics may provide prognostic information that can be useful at the individual patient level.

It is restricted in the vast majority of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Even if a patient does not yet suffer from functional disability - deficits of balance do already appear in the early phase of MS, but are not detected by standard examination and scoring procedures. Perceptive computing using data from consumer grade 3D sensors like the Microsoft Kinect allows motion tracking in everyday settings and promises exact and relatively low cost motor diagnostics.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To develop a reliable and observer-independent method for quantification of postural control in patients with multiple sclerosis using perceptive computing.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We examined 99 patients with Clinically Isolated Syndrome (CIS) or MS (57 female, 42 male, mean&#x000b1;SD age 44&#x000b1;11 years, median EDSS 2.5) and 60 healthy controls (HC) with a custom built system using Microsoft&#x02019;s Kinect. Subjects performed three measurements with comfortable, closed and tandem stance, each with eyes open the first 15 seconds and eyes closed the last 15 seconds. Roll speed along the medio-lateral axis, pitch speed along the anterior-posterior axis and sum of 3D movements were calculated. Patients were examined based on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC). Self-reported walking disability was assessed using the MS walking scale questionnaire (MSWS-12).</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Already in comfortable stance with open eyes, MS patients showed significantly higher sum movements than HC (7.52&#x000b1;3.54 cm vs. 5.79&#x000b1;1.95 cm, p&#x0003c; 0.001), pitch speed (0.41&#x000b1;0.22 cm/sec vs. 0.30&#x000b1;0.10 cm/sec, p=&#x0003c; 0.001) and roll speed (0.26&#x000b1;0.15 cm/sec vs. 0.20&#x000b1;0.09 cm/sec, p=0.005). On average, MS patients worsened both with closed eyes as well as with increasing stance difficulty. Best correlations with disease severity and self-reported walking disability were achieved with closed stance and closed eyes for summed 3D movement (EDSS Spearman&#x02019;s Rho=0.500, p&#x0003c; 0.001; MSWS-12 Rho=0.455, p&#x0003c; 0.001), pitch speed (EDSS Rho=0.478, p&#x0003c; 0.001, MSWS-12 Rho=0.426) and roll speed (EDSS Rho=0.455, p&#x0003c; 0.001; MSWS-12 Rho=0.420, p&#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> Perceptive computing based assessment of postural control was fast, well tolerated and effective in detecting sway differences between HC and MS patients.</p></sec><sec id="section136-1352458514546076"><title>PS12.5 Reliability of clinically feasible gait analysis in multiple sclerosis</title><p><underline>JJ Sosnoff</underline><sup>1</sup>, RE Klaren<sup>1</sup>, L Pilutti<sup>1</sup>, D Dlugonski<sup>2</sup>, RW Motl<sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Urbana, IL, United States, <sup>2</sup>East Carolina University, Kinesiology, Greenville, NC, United States</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> Gait impairment is ubiquitous in persons with MS, a marker of disability and commonly targeted in rehabilitation. It has been suggested that pressure sensitive walkways are clinically feasible and capable of detecting mild gait impairment in person with MS. However, the reliability of this gait analysis approach is not clear - especially over longer durations (e.g. 6 months) - that are important for clinical practice and research. Indeed, such reliability is critical for clinical decision-making and power analyses for designing randomized controlled trials (i.e., sample size estimates).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To determine the reliability and stability of spatiotemporal measures from clinically feasible gait analysis in persons with MS over 6 months.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> We enrolled 86 ambulatory persons (77% female) with MS. Self-reported disability as indexed by patient determined disease steps scale ranged from 0 to 6.0 (median = 3.0). Participants underwent gait assessment twice over 6 months in the absence of any intervention. Gait assessment included two trials of walking at a self-selected pace over a 4.9 m pressure sensitive mat (GAITRITE&#x02122;). Reliability was based on intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for gait velocity, functional ambulation profile (FAP) score, cadence, step time and double support percentage. Stability was based on paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> Double support percentage had the lowest ICC of 0.75 (95% CI = 0.61-0.84), whereas gait velocity, step time, and cadence all had ICC&#x02019;s of 0.95 (95% CIs = 0.93-0.97. FAP score had an ICC of 0.94 (95%=0.90-0.96)). The <italic>t</italic>-tests identified that gait velocity was significantly slower at follow-up testing by 7.4 cm/s [t(1,73)=&#x02212;5.1;p&#x0003c; .05] and this coincided with a reduction in cadence [t(1,73)=&#x02212;5.4;p&#x0003c; .05] and increase in step time [t(1,73)=3.1;p&#x0003c; .05].

Our laboratory has been interested in characterizing these changes in rodent models and in post-mortem human brains.</p><p>The results of these analyses will be presented, with an emphasis on a better understanding of the potential implications of these findings for remyelination and therapy responsiveness.</p></sec><sec id="section140-1352458514546076"><title>HT4.2 Remyelination in the adult central nervous system: mechanisms and perspectives</title><p><underline>C Lubetzki</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Salpetriere Hospital, Paris 6 University, Paris, France</p><p>The influence of remyelination on the prevention of axonal damage and loss has been highlighted by different experimental approaches, as well as by analysis of multiple sclerosis lesions. However, although this repair process is efficient in many experimental models of demyelination, it often fails in MS, leaving denuded, hence vulnerable, axons. Oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), disseminated within the adult central nervous system, are the major contributors to remyelination. These immature cells are first activated, then migrate to the demyelinated lesion where they differentiate into oligodendrocytes, before wrapping new myelin sheaths around naked axons. These different steps have to be orchestrated at the right time and the right place to allow successful repair.</p><p>To gain insight into the mechanisms involved in activation and recruitment of adult OPCs, we analyzed the gene expression profile of adult OPCs purified by flow cytometry from adult murine PDGF-aR brains and demonstrated that adult OPCs have a transcriptome more similar to that of oligodendrocytes than to neonatal OPCs, but revert to a neonatal-like transcriptome when activated. We then showed that part of the activation response involves increased expression of two genes of the innate immune system, IL1&#x003b2; and CCL2. Using in vitro and in vivo experiments, we demonstrated that OPCs expressing IL1&#x003b2; or CCL2 are more motile, a crucial capacity to enable them to be directed to the demyelinated lesion by guidance cues.</p><p>In parallel, we have investigated the influence of guidance cues on the recruitment of adult OPCs and focused on class 3 semaphorins and Netrin 1. We showed that these guidance cues:</p><list list-type="roman-lower" id="list7-1352458514546076"><list-item><p>are upregulated after demyelination in the adult central nervous system, both in experimental models and in MS lesions;</p></list-item><list-item><p>influence adult OPCs migration/recruitment, with a repellent effect of Semaphorin 3A and Netrin 1, contrasting with an attractant effect of Semaphorin 3F.</p></list-item></list><p>Finally, we demonstrated that modulation of OPCs recruitment influence remyelination rate. These proof of concept studies showing that OPC recruitment influence repair, modify the current view on remyelination strategy, as speeding this repair process is crucially needed to prevent irreversible axonal damage.</p><p>These different studies pave the way for identification of potential therapeutic targets for repair strategies in multiple sclerosis patients.</p></sec><sec id="section141-1352458514546076"><title>HT4.3 Fluorosamine that targets scar components is a novel therapeutic that promotes myelin regeneration and reduces inflammation in demyelination models</title><p>M Keough<sup>1</sup>, J Rogers<sup>1</sup>, P Zhang<sup>1</sup>, S Jensen<sup>1</sup>, E Stephenson<sup>1</sup>, J Plemel<sup>1</sup>, M Hurlbert<sup>1</sup>, C-C Ling<sup>1</sup>, <underline>VW Yong</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> While there are currently several available disease-modifying immunotherapies for multiple sclerosis (MS), new therapeutics are needed not only to reduce detrimental inflammation but also to enhance the endogenous process of remyelination. Components of the lesion-associated glial scar, including the chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs), are promising drug targets as they are known inhibitors of axonal regeneration as well as remyelination.</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> We assessed the efficacy of a novel, fluorinated analog of N-acetylglucosamine (fluorosamine) to reduce CSPG synthesis following experimental demyelination in order to enhance remyelination. Additionally, we determined if fluorosamine has immunomodulatory properties in an inflammatory demyelinating model.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Focal toxin-induced demyelination was produced in mice via injection of lysolecithin into the spinal cord dorsal column. Inflammatory demyelination was produced using the experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. Animals were treated with fluorosamine after injury and repair was assessed by measuring disability burden and new myelin sheath formation. Cellular mechanisms were verified with isolated cells in culture, including oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), astrocytes, and splenocytes.</p><p><bold>Results:</bold> The differentiation and maturation of OPCs is impaired in the presence of a CSPG substrate. Astrocytes produce CSPGs when stimulated in culture, which is perturbed with fluorosamine; after lysolecithin injury, fluorosamine reduces CSPG synthesis, resulting in greater generation of oligodendrocytes and new myelin sheaths. Splenocytes in culture are activated in response to CSPGs and their proliferation rate is diminished in the presence of fluorosamine; after induction of EAE, fluorosamine reduces disease scores when treatment is initiated from onset of clinical signs or from peak clinical disability.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:</bold> CSPGs are a barrier to endogenous remyelination after injury. Reducing their synthesis with fluorosamine provides a more conducive environment to new myelin formation. The additional immunomodulatory properties of fluorosamine may have an added benefit of reducing new lesion formation and disease burden. We believe that a two-pronged approach of immunomodulation and remyelination by overcoming lesion-associated CSPGs expands the therapeutic options in MS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="section142-1352458514546076"><title>HT5 - Inflammation and neurodegeneration</title><sec id="section143-1352458514546076"><title>HT5.1 Metabolomics, mitochondria and energy imbalance in MS</title><p><underline>PA Calabresi</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>Johns Hopkins University, Neurology, Baltimore, MD, United States</p><p>A common disabling symptom of MS is fatigue, yet the mechanisms underlying fatigue remain poorly understood. Both inflammation and neuronal dysfunction likely contribute to the sensation of fatigue, and the molecular basis for this process is beginning to be elucidated through studies of metabolic disarray in the blood and CNS. Demyelination increases energy demands in axons, which results in a short-term mitochondrial proliferative response that temporarily compensates for the increased demands. However, this strategy ultimately fails if demands exceed mitochondrial function and the resulting ATP deficit causes ionic and oxidative stress leading to axonal degeneration.</p><p>The importance of metabolism in immune cells was also highlighted in recent studies, which showed that effector memory cells switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis in a well-described process called the Warburg effect. The switch to glycolysis was initially thought to be a consequence of mitochondrial damage, but recent data suggest glycolysis may provide an advantage to proliferating cells by facilitating effector functions. A recent metabolomic study uncovered 44 metabolites and six major metabolic pathways that were altered in EAE and correlated with disease severity, suggesting several novel therapeutic targets related to bioenergetics of immune cells.</p><p>Glycolysis is also relevant in the CNS where lactate is a major source of energy for neurons. Lactate is shuttled to neurons by the monocarboxylate transporter (MCT-1), which is highly expressed on oligodendrocytes. Remarkably when MCT-1 is conditionally deleted or repressed in the oligodendrocytes of mice, the impaired transfer of lactate to neurons results in neurodegeneration confirming their critical role in neuronal survival. Further, this result suggests that axonal degeneration may precede demyelination and can occur as the result of dysfunctional oligodendrocytes.</p><p>Accurate and sensitive methods to measure important metabolites are critical to further understanding of the cellular processes involved in pathogenesis. Metabolomics has been facilitated by the increased availability of high throughput, sensitive, yet highly specific mass spectrometry methods. I will discuss recent data regarding metabolism and energy demands in both the peripheral blood and the CNS, which may provide important clues to disease pathogenesis and also novel avenues for therapeutic intervention in MS.</p></sec><sec id="section144-1352458514546076"><title>HT5.2 Parasitic infections and MS</title><p><underline>J Correale</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>FLENI, Neurology, Buenos Aires, Argentina</p><p>MS incidence has significantly increased during the second half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, generating considerable interest in analyzing the basis for this rise in the developed world. Particular emphasis is being placed on the role infections might play in exacerbating or preventing disease onset. Epidemiological data suggest that improvement in sanitation conditions and reduced exposure to infection might explain, at least in part, these changes. The hygiene hypothesis is not new and is often used to explain the increasing incidence of allergies and other autoimmune diseases observed at present. Because helminths are powerful modulators of host immunity, some authors hypothesize that reduced parasite exposure due to improved hygiene conditions may favor MS development. Supporting these findings, recent investigations demonstrate a dichotomous relationship between regional distribution of MS and that of the parasite Trichuris trichiura, a common human pathogen. In line with these observations, our group demonstrated that helminth-infected MS patients showed significantly lower number of relapses, minimal changes in disability scores and significantly lower disease activity on MRI compared to uninfected individuals with MS. Parasite-driven protection was associated with induction of regulatory T cells secreting IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2;, as well as of CD4+CD25+ FoxP3+ T cells displaying significant suppression function, while simultaneously inhibiting T-cell proliferation and suppressing IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 production. In addition, helminth infections also induced IL-10-producing regulatory B cells, capable of dampening the immune response. Interestingly, when some of these patients received antihelminthic drug treatment for worsening of parasite-associated symptoms, significant increase in clinical and radiological MS activity was observed. Flares were accompanied by substantial increase in IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-12 producing cell numbers and a decline in IL-10, TGF-&#x003b2; and regulatory T cells, providing evidence of direct suppression of the autoimmune response as a result of helminth infection.</p><p>During this presentation I will discuss epidemiological, experimental, clinical and molecular data supporting the protective role of helminthes against MS. Better understanding of host-parasite interactions caused by specific parasite molecules with immunomodulatory effects will help combat allergies and autoimmune disease without the price of untoward infection as a side-effect.</p></sec><sec id="section145-1352458514546076"><title>HT5.3 Neuro-axonal damage in MS may be mediated by interaction of innate immunity and anti-axonal antibodies</title><p>JD Black<sup>1,2</sup>, <underline>MS Freedman</underline><sup>1,2,3</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>University of Ottawa, Biochemistry, Microbiology &#x00026; Immunology, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>2</sup>Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, Neuroscience, Ottawa, ON, Canada, <sup>3</sup>Ottawa Hospital, Neurology, Ottawa, ON, Canada</p><p><bold>Background:</bold> There are many purported mechanisms of immune-mediated damage to central nervous system (CNS) neurons and axons involving both adaptive and innate immunity. We have been interested in the potential role of &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells in MS immunopathogenesis. Axon-specific neurofascin (Nfasc) antibodies are found particularly in MS serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Antibodies that may not be directly pathogenic can bind to Fc receptors (FcR) on innate immune cells, such as &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells, and mediate damage via a mechanism termed antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).</p><p><bold>Objectives:</bold> To investigate a possible role for &#x003b3;&#x003b4; T-cells and anti-Nfasc antibody in mediating neuro-axonal injury via ADCC.</p><p><bold>Methods:</bold> Anti-Nfasc antibodies were quantitated by ELISA in the CSF of MS patients.

The public pressures brought to bear by this publicity inexorably led to the funding by the Canadian and American MS Societies of several studies to determine if CCSVI in fact exists in patients with MS, and the subsequent funding by the Canadian MS Society and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research of a multi-centered study to assess the effects of treatment of CCSVI.</p><p>Several factors account for the enthusiasm for CCSVI and the generation of enormous pressures to fast track its study: 1) the understandable frustration of MS patients with what is perceived as the slow rate of progress in finding a definitive cure for MS; 2) the attractiveness of an apparently simple explanation for a complex problem; 3) suspicion among some members of the MS patient community of the motives of physicians prescribing expensive drugs to treat MS; 4) a vigorous and highly penetrant MS social network; 5) the perception by some advocates for MS patients that government, responsible for health care in a single payer system, would be susceptible to public pressures; 6) the irresponsibility of elements of the media in publishing ostensible news stories that walked close to or over the line of advocacy journalism.</p><p>MS physicians have a responsibility proactively but respectfully to address with patients the implausibility of panaceas poorly grounded in any biologic rationale, while acknowledging that the long-term efficacy of the promising new disease-modifying therapies is as yet unproven.</p></sec><sec id="section148-1352458514546076"><title>HT6.2 Patients as partners in clinical research - Does the Internet harm or help?</title><p><underline>P Wicks</underline><sup>1</sup></p><p><sup>1</sup>PatientsLikeMe, Cambridge, MA, United States</p><p>Since the invention of the Mosaic web browser in 1993 the Internet has evolved to a consumer-focussed web of specialised services across digital devices, with great benefits for medical education, patient support groups, and advocacy.

Neurons encode many parameters simultaneously, but the fidelity of encoding at the level of individual neurons is weak. However, because encoding is redundant and consistent across the population, extraction methods based on multiple neurons are capable of generating a faithful representation of intended movement. The realization that useful information is embedded in the population has spawned the current success of brain-controlled interfaces. Since multiple movement parameters are encoded simultaneously in the same population of neurons, we have been gradually increasing the degrees of freedom (DOF) that a subject can control through the interface. Our early work showed that 3-dimensions could be controlled in a virtual reality task. We then demonstrated control of an anthropomorphic physical device with 4 DOF in a self-feeding task. Currently, monkeys in our laboratory are using this interface to control a very realistic, prosthetic arm with a wrist and hand to grasp objects in different locations and orientations.

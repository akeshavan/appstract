Indeed, about 90% of sciatica cases are due to a herniated disc involving nerve root compression. Other possible causes include a narrow lumbar canal, foraminal stenosis, tumors, and cysts.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> Herniated lumbar disc-related sciatica is one of the most common conditions managed in primary medical care and a significant cause of absence from work and early retirement. Patients, families, and the society at large all carry part of the burden.<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>Sciatica resolves without treatment in the majority of cases. However, many patients endure substantial pain and disability.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup> Medication and physical therapy are used as the initial treatment options for pain control. However, there is little evidence for the efficacy of pain medication.<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Several systematic reviews have analyzed the efficacy and safety of various drugs such as opioids and steroids, but the validity of the studies is limited.<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Furthermore, the use of pain medication has been associated with adverse effects such as sedation, dizziness, ataxia, and nausea.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Similarly, there is little evidence for the efficacy of invasive surgeries such as lumbar discectomy and epidural steroid injections (ESIs).<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Acupuncture and electroacupuncture (EA) have been applied for the treatment of sciatica since the early 1990s,<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup> but results of studies on their efficacy have been inconsistent. According to the theory of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), acupuncture needles are inserted into the body, and sufficient manual needling manipulation (e.g., lifting-thrusting and twisting-rotating) of the inserted needles elicits a composite of sensations (the response of the characteristic needle-manipulation sensation is termed <italic>deqi</italic>, which generally manifests as numbness, heaviness, distention, and soreness), which is believed to be an indispensable component in achieving a therapeutic effect. It is noteworthy that in clinical practice, many patients are afraid of the <italic>deqi</italic> sensation. Fear of needle-manipulation sensation is an important reason as to why patients choose to forego acupuncture treatment.</p><p>Ankle acupuncture (AA) is a type of subcutaneous acupuncture that has been developed in the 1970s.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> Compared with traditional acupuncture manipulation, AA penetrates the skin and inserts the needles shallowly in the subcutaneous tissue above the ankle, with no characteristic needle-manipulation sensation. Patients are more likely to accept AA due to the absence of needle-manipulation sensation. In addition, as it requires only the insertion of a single needle with no further manual manipulation, it can be easily taught to medical staff without much knowledge about acupuncture. Accumulating evidence from Chinese literature sources reveals that AA has similar therapeutic effects as traditional acupuncture in the treatment of pain.<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Some studies have reported the efficacy of AA for the treatment of sciatica.<sup>[<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> However, these studies were hampered by insufficient reporting methods of randomization and allocation concealment, improper blinding, and inadequate strength of the inference. To date, no appropriately powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of AA for sciatic pain associated with a herniated lumbar disc have been conducted.</p><p>Time-dependent characteristics of acupuncture might be one of the most important factors in the assessment of its effects in the relief of pain. Based on the time-dependent characteristics of acupuncture, the effects of acupuncture are generally classified as either immediate (after the end of the first treatment session) or cumulative (after repeated acupuncture stimulation).<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> So far, most clinical trials and systematic reviews assessing the role of acupuncture have focused on the cumulative effects of repeated acupuncture stimulation. However, the immediate effects could have clinical significance and methodological advantages. Immediate pain reduction might motivate the patient to continue treatment and facilitate further physiotherapy. Patients who receive little benefit or no immediate analgesic effect following the first treatment might be expected to be less likely to gain benefit from repeated stimulation. Notably, for many patients with acute pain such as that resulting from surgery or childbirth, the reported analgesic effects of acupuncture are usually immediate. Furthermore, the results of some functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have suggested that the immediate and cumulative effects of acupuncture treatment elicit different temporal neural responses in a wide range of brain networks,<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> which could explain the underlying specific mechanisms of the immediate effects of acupuncture.</p><p>Therefore, we propose an RCT to evaluate the immediate effect of AA for sciatic pain associated with a herniated lumbar disc. The results of our clinical trial might guide better rational and selective use of acupuncture as a treatment for sciatica in the future.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Trial design</title><p>The study is designed to be a randomized, three-arm, parallel-group, controlled trial to evaluate the immediate efficacy, safety, and acceptability of AA therapy for sciatic pain due to a herniated lumbar disc.

Different from traditional acupuncture, AA penetrates the skin and inserts the needles shallowly in the subcutaneous tissue above the ankle, with no characteristic needle-manipulation sensation. Therefore, the procedure is not only effective, but also requires only simple equipment and is inexpensive, relatively safe, convenient, and quick. However, the practice of AA is still mainly based on personal experience. Further clinical research on AA will provide additional evidence to confirm its effectiveness, thereby enhancing its acceptance and utilization. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immediate effect of ankle acupuncture for sciatica associated with a herniated lumbar disc. We propose the following specific aims: (1) to determine if patients receiving AA show significant improvements in pain as measured by VAS compared to control patients; and (2) to determine the safety and acceptability of AA therapy by assessing its possible adverse effects and acceptability ratings after one session of treatment. One of the strengths of our study is that it is designed to be a feasible, comparative effectiveness trial design that is similar to common clinical situations. The results of this study will determine if AA is an effective therapy for sciatica due to a herniated lumbar disc.</p><p>There is considerable evidence to show that acupuncture treatment produces pain relief for durations that outlast the period of stimulation.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> These prolonged effects after cessation of acupuncture stimulation may undergo 2 phases: (1) sudden, dramatic relief of pain for several hours after stimulation, and (2) gradual pain relief that returns days or weeks after a single treatment session.<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> In this study, we will observe the duration of pain relief to provide information as to how long pain relief lasts after a single session of AA. We will set 2 follow-up time points: 3 and 7 days. Multiple time points will be used to reflect the time-effect of AA for sciatica associated with a herniated lumbar disc. Additional post-treatment measurements after single session of AA therapy will provide useful information to make definitive inferences about the clinical relevance and the underlying physiological mechanism of AA.</p><p>In this study, we will focus on the immediate effect of AA on sciatic pain associated with a herniated lumbar disc. The measurements will only be conducted for a single session of AA treatment. There are many methodological advantages. For example, natural remission of disease, regression to the mean in clinical studies, and other factors disturbing the internal validity of results should play a minor role compared with other study designs.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> However, it is notable that a single treatment is not adequate in patients suffering from chronic pain. From a clinical point of view, the cumulative effect of acupuncture has been considered as an important factor associated with its clinical efficacy.<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> Given that cumulative effects of repeated acupuncture are not simply because of overlapping immediate analgesic effects,<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]</sup> further rigorous, high-quality, RCTs comparing acupuncture with no treatment and sham acupuncture are required to evaluate the cumulative effects of repeated AA stimulation.</p><p>A major limitation of the present study is that the acupuncturist will not be blinded to the treatment. However, the patients will be blinded to the acupuncture treatments since they cannot distinguish true from sham AA. In addition, the treatment duration will be similar in the 3 groups, and pain will be evaluated by a clinician who is unaware of the treatment received, at a time when all needles have been withdrawn. In addition, the use of an appropriate control group is a critical issue in designing a high-quality clinical trial. It is difficult to provide scientifically robust sham treatments as controls because the specific mechanisms and causal pathways of AA are not known. For example, it is unknown whether there are neural pathways associated with both specific and nonspecific effects, such as those associated with self-healing. In this study, we set 2 control groups. In the sham AA group, the needle tip just pricks on the skin without penetrating. In the TNM group, the needle tip will be swiftly inserted into the skin at the target point at a 90-degree angle. Therefore, 2 control groups set in this study will prove the specificity of AA in the treatment of sciatic pain associated with a herniated lumbar disc.</p><p>In conclusion, this study will focus on the efficacy of AA for treating sciatic pain associated with a herniated lumbar disc. It will also be interesting to evaluate the safety and acceptability of AA treatment. We hope that this study provides useful information to advance the methodology of acupuncture trials and adds evidence for the effectiveness of AA for sciatic pain, with sufficient levels of acceptability and safety.</p></sec><sec><label>8</label><title>Authorship</title><p>AFX contributed to conception, design, and writing of the manuscript, MSX and YL contributed to conception and design, JZW contributed to conception and revising the manuscript critically and SL contributed to conception, writing of the manuscript, and revising the manuscript critically.

Secondary outcome measures were clinical or laboratory measures of balance or gait.Search strategyA search for published and unpublished literature from inception to March 2015 written in the English language was conducted across a number of major electronic databases. A three-step search strategy was developed using MeSH terminology and keywords to ensure all that relevant materials are captured.Methodological qualityMethodological quality of included studies was assessed by two reviewers, who appraised each study independently, using standardized Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools.Data extractionQuantitative data were extracted from the studies that were identified as meeting the criteria for methodological quality using the standardized JBI data extraction tools.Data synthesisDue to the heterogeneity of populations, interventions and outcome measures, meta-analyses were not possible and results are presented in narrative form.KeywordsBalancefallsfootwearinsolesneuropathyBackgroundSensory perception loss in the lower limbs is commonly associated with a number of chronic conditions including diabetes, neurological and autoimmune diseases.1-4 Peripheral neuropathy associated with diabetes is the most common cause of sensory perception loss, affecting up to 50% of individuals with the condition.4 Altered somatosensory input can have major implications on postural control. At the feet, reduced information about the supporting surface or altered awareness of lower limb positioning can impair the ability to successfully respond to threats to balance. These sensory changes, commonly observed in aging populations, can be accelerated in adults with pathological loss of foot sensation,3,5 increasing their risk of falls and injury.6-8Falls are a major public health issue for adults with sensory perception loss. In people with diabetes, many of whom present with peripheral neuropathy, up to 39% of those aged over 65 years8 and 35% of those above 55 years9 are reported to fall annually. While pathological sensory loss cannot be reversed, one potential modifiable external fall risk factor is the interface between the foot or ankle and supporting surface. Foot and ankle devices including footwear, insoles and ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) are all modalities that can be manipulated to alter this interface and potentially an individual's propensity to falling. Indeed, several studies show that wearing suboptimal footwear is an influential factor contributing to slips, trips and falls in older people.10 Notably, inappropriate footwear has been reported in up to 75% of people who experience a fall-related hip fracture.11Foot and ankle devices, including shoe insoles and AFOs have been shown to alter standing balance,12 gait kinetics and kinematics12-14 in healthy young,13 aging,12 rheumatoid arthritic15 and diabetic neuropathic14 populations. While their mechanism of action remains unclear, current theories suggest that footwear interventions may bring about their effects by way of providing mechanical support, shock attenuation and alterations in sensorimotor control, or a combination of all.16,17 Mechanoreceptors located in the plantar surface of the feet provide important sensory information about changes in the position of foot pressure, which is used to inform maintenance of upright body position. However, plantar sensory thresholds are reduced with increasing age18,19 and further compromised in those with pathological sensory perception loss.3,20 As such, a wide range of shoe insole devices have been developed with a view to enhancing residual sensory information at the lower limbs for improving balance control and gait in insensate populations.21-26 Insoles can be defined as any material construction positioned within a shoe, on which the foot rests. Insoles can be pre-fabricated or custom-made devices and include a variety of profiles ranging from form-fitting to flat insoles.To date, three systematic reviews have been conducted addressing the impact of insoles12,27 and footwear features10 on measures of balance and falls risk in aging populations, including those with peripheral nervous system disorders.27 However, despite the major clinical and functional implications of sensory perception loss, the role of footwear interventions in this patient group has not been addressed using systematic review methodology. The prescription of therapeutic footwear and insoles plays a pivotal role in the management of people with peripheral neuropathy, as a means to reduce areas of high plantar pressures and prevent the development of foot ulceration.28 While this preventative strategy aligns with recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines29 and a Cochrane review of the data,30 the potential benefits (or otherwise) of such footwear interventions on balance, gait or falls risk remain unknown.Laboratory and clinical-based measures of balance and gait have been used to explore the effects of wearing footwear interventions on postural control mechanisms.12,31-33 During static balance tasks, such as standing quietly in a comfortable position (unperturbed), on a force platform, the magnitude and velocity of center of pressure (COP) movement in mediolateral and anterior-posterior axes have been extracted to quantify the effect of insoles and footwear.12 Notably, COP velocity is reported to be one of the most sensitive measures in detecting between-condition differences in balance control.34 Other traditional sway parameters, such as mean speed and amplitude of the COP, have been used in previous trials to predict falls.35 Clinical assessments of mobility and functional task performance enable clinicians to observe balance control during demanding postural challenges that simulate those encountered in daily life.36,37 Such balance tests include the functional reach and Berg Balance Scale, with the former reported to be a predictor of falls and sensitive to change following the introduction of an intervention.38,39 Further, modifications in walking patterns have been associated with falls in aging populations.40 Older fallers frequently adopt a more conservative gait pattern, showing marked reductions in velocity and step length, increased step width and variability.41,42 Therefore, spatiotemporal gait parameters commonly feature as primary outcome measures in studies evaluating the effect of an intervention on falls risk.12,43,44The aim of this review was three-fold. First, the review aimed to highlight balance and gait deficits and falls risk for consideration by healthcare professionals when prescribing foot and ankle devices to people with loss of foot sensation. Second, this review set out to establish the therapeutic benefits (or otherwise) of foot and ankle devices on laboratory and clinical measures of balance, mobility and falls, within clinical populations with sensory perception loss. Third, the results of this review will be used to identify any footwear interventions and design features that have the capacity to alter balance, gait and reduce falls. This knowledge will be used to guide the future prescription and development of foot and ankle devices for people with pathological sensory perception loss. This review was conducted according to an a priori published protocol.45ObjectivesThe primary and secondary objectives of this systematic review were to:Synthesize the best available evidence regarding the effects of foot and ankle devices on falls in adults with pathological, bilateral lower limb sensory perception loss.Evaluate the effect of foot and ankle devices on the surrogate secondary measures of falls risk, with regard to: (i) gait and (ii) balance in adults with pathological, bilateral lower limb sensory perception loss.Generate knowledge to inform the development of a new footwear device for people at increased risk of balance impairments and falls due to loss of foot sensation.More specifically, the review content provides a summary of current evidence regarding the effect of foot and ankle devices (including therapeutic and retail footwear, pre-fabricated and custom-made insoles and AFO) on fall frequency or incidence, and clinical or laboratory measures of balance and gait, in adults with sensory perception loss.Inclusion criteriaTypes of participantsThe current review considered studies that included participants who were community-dwelling adults over the age of 18 years with bilateral sensory perception loss, defined as being unable to feel a 10 g monofilament at one or more sites on the plantar surface of the foot.46Exclusion criteriaPeople with foot ulceration at the time of the study.People with unilateral sensory perception loss.People from hospitals or care homes.People with an upper motor neuron injury (e.g. stroke survivors).People with age-related loss of foot sensation that did not originate from pathology.Types of intervention(s)/phenomena of interestThe current review considered studies that evaluated the effect of any foot or ankle device on balance, gait or falls in adults with sensory perception loss. Foot or ankle devices were defined as any device placed in direct contact with the foot or ankle. This included therapeutic and non-therapeutic footwear, insoles designed to increase mechanical support or afferent sensory feedback, AFO and ankle braces used to restrict joint motion. In this review, studies were included if they presented one of the following comparisons: (i) foot or ankle device was compared to another foot or ankle device or (ii) foot or ankle device was compared to no intervention/control condition.Studies that included any of the following interventions were excluded from the review:Industrial safety footwear.AFO that extends to the level of, or beyond, the knee joint.Foot ulcer offloading devices.OutcomesStudies that reported any measure of falls frequency or incidence were eligible for inclusion in the review. This review also considered studies that included any standardized clinical measures (e.g. Berg Balance Scale,36 Functional Reach37) or laboratory-based assessment (e.g. COP movement34) of static or dynamic standing balance. Similarly, studies that measured gait by way of clinical tests (e.g. Timed Up and Go Test,47 Dynamic Gait Index48) or laboratory assessments (e.g. spatiotemporal gait parameters41) were included in the review.Types of studiesThe current review considered experimental and epidemiological study designs including randomized controlled trials, non-randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental, before and after studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies and analytical cross-sectional studies. Descriptive epidemiological study designs including case series, individual case reports and descriptive cross-sectional studies were excluded from the review.Search strategyThe search strategy aimed to find both published and unpublished studies. A three-step search strategy was utilized in this review. An initial limited search of MEDLINE and EMBASE (OVID) was undertaken followed by analysis of the text words contained in the title and abstract, and of the index terms used to describe the articles. A second search using all identified keywords and index terms was undertaken across all included databases. Third, the reference list of all identified reports and articles was searched for additional studies. Studies published in the English language and published from inception to March 2015 were considered for inclusion in this review.The sources to be searched includes:MEDLINE, Embase (OVID), CINAHL, AMED (EBSCO), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Database of Systematic Reviews and Implementation Reports.The search for unpublished studies included:Google Scholar, a thesis database (http://www.thesis.com), BIOSIS, Zetoc (http://zetoc.jisc.ac.uk.plymouth.idm.oclc.org/wzgw?db=etoc) and EThOS.Initial MESH and key terms that were used were related to foot orthosis and insoles, footwear and shoes, ankle foot orthosis and ankle braces, postural balance and body sway, gait and walking pattern, stabilising and destabilising, accidental falls, older persons, nervous system disorders, diabetes and neuropathy.An example of a full search strategy used in a major database is provided in Appendix I.Method of the reviewAll studies selected for retrieval were assessed by two independent reviewers for methodological validity prior to inclusion in the review. A list of the full-text articles that were assessed for eligibility can be found in Appendix II. Each paper was assessed using standardized critical appraisal instruments from the Joanna Briggs Institute Meta-Analysis of Statistics Assessment and Review Instrument (JBI-MAStARI) (Appendix III). Where disagreements arose between the reviewers, these were resolved through discussion until agreement was reached. When it was unclear if study participants were assessed as having pathological sensory perception loss, the corresponding author of the article was contacted for clarification. In total, eight authors were contacted and six responded. When no response was received from an author, the corresponding article was excluded.Data extractionQuantitative data were extracted from papers included in the review using the standardized data extraction tool from JBI-MAStARI (Appendix IV). The data extracted included specific details about the interventions, populations, study methods and outcomes of significance to the review question and specific objectives.Data synthesisQuantitative data analysis by way of statistical pooling was not possible due to the wide and heterogeneous range of study methods and outcome measures used across the included studies. Therefore, the findings of this review are presented in narrative form, with general themes established in the discussion.Findings of the reviewThe studies included within this review were too heterogeneous to be combined for meta-analysis. Studies differed in terms of participant characteristics, intervention and outcome measures, therefore findings will be presented in a narrative form. A summary of the results, conclusions and characteristics of included studies can be found in Appendix VI.Comparison 1: insoles with vibrating component activated versus insoles with vibrating component immobilizedActivated vibrating insoles (turned on) were compared with immobilized vibrating insoles (turned off) for people with diabetes and neuropathy in two studies,21,22 including 32 people with diabetes and neuropathy and 27 healthy older adults. Both studies measured the effect of the insoles on postural sway. One study recorded mean and maximum stabilogram radius, area and range in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral direction using a marker attached to the right shoulder, quiet standing with eyes closed only.21 While the other used force plate stabiliometry to record root mean square COP velocity in anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions with eyes open, eyes closed and while performing a dual task.22Both studies reported increased sway in people with diabetes and neuropathy when compared to controls. One trial21 reported a significant reduction in all sway parameters measured with eyes closed in both groups with vibration activated, although absolute values or the size of the difference were not fully reported. The other trial22 found no difference between insole conditions with the exception of anterior-posterior sway in the group with diabetes and neuropathy. However, this difference was only evident when balance was challenged by simultaneously removing visual cues and diverting attention. Under these test conditions, the root mean square COP velocity in the anterior-posterior direction reduced from 24.3 to 20.4 mm/s when the vibration was activated.22 Both studies provide evidence that vibrating insoles may reduce sway in people with diabetes and neuropathy when other compensatory balance strategies are compromised.Comparison 3: regular footwear versus barefoot for people with diabetes and neuropathyA single study51 compared regular footwear with walking barefoot, in 12 people with diabetes and neuropathy and eight controls matched for age, sex and body mass index. The authors reported on nine different gait parameters recorded while participants walked over short (7 m) and long (20 m) distances. Participants were asked to bring the shoes they wore most often during activities of daily living. Most chose to wear either Oxford type footwear (approximately 40%) or New Balance type footwear (approximately 60%) (personal correspondence with the author). There was no difference in any of the gait parameters when regular footwear was worn over a short distance. Over the longer distance, the diabetic neuropathic group displayed a significantly greater double support time (20%) when compared to the elderly control group. The was no significant difference in any of the gait parameters when regular footwear was worn over a long distance with the exception of coefficient of variation of gait velocity. Over the longer distances, wearing shoes reduced the coefficient of variation of gait velocity in people with diabetes and neuropathy by 46% to a similar level to that seen in the controls when tested wearing shoes. There is limited evidence to suggest that wearing footwear over long distances increases the consistency of step-to-step velocity in people with diabetes and neuropathy to a level similar to that seen in elderly healthy people.Comparison 4: ankle-foot orthosis versus no intervention for people with sensory perception lossAnkle-foot orthosis was compared to no intervention in 65 people with peripheral neuropathy in three studies24,52,53 reported in four publications.24,52-54 Participants were diagnosed with a range of underlying long-term conditions; 49 were diagnosed with diabetes, nine suffered idiopathic sensory loss, three had connective tissue disease, two had neuropathy originating from the toxic effect of medication, one was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and one had a family history of neuropathy.One study52 compared a plastic semi-flexible sagittal plane AFO with no intervention in 11 people with sensory perception loss, seven of whom were diagnosed diabetic. The authors measured balance using the specifically designed dynamic postural system (EquiTest NeuroCom International Inc). The authors reported that the sensory organization scores calculated by the system significantly improved when the AFO was worn by 13% standing with eyes open, 35% standing with eyes closed, 39% standing on a rotating platform with eyes open and 59% standing on a rotating platform with eyes closed.In a second study,53 the same research team appeared to repeat their 2006 study with a group of 12 people with diabetes and neuropathy. The authors reported that the sensory organization scores calculated by the dynamic postural system improved significantly with eyes closed but not with eyes open. The improvement recorded when the AFO was worn when standing on a static platform with eyes closed was 2%. The improvement recorded when the AFO was worn when standing on the rotating platform with eyes closed was 80%.A third study24 compared a medial-lateral AFO with no intervention in 42 people with peripheral neuropathy, (30 with diabetes) while walking over irregular terrain under low-light conditions. The authors reported a significant reduction in step width range (-28.4 mm), step width variability (-3.8 mm) and step time variability of (0.024 s) when the AFO was worn. Standard deviation (SD) was used as a measure of variability. However, it is unclear if the calculation was based on the SD of the total group score or the range of SDs taken from individual scores.In a separate publication,54 the same research team presents secondary analysis from their previous 2004 study using a sub-sample of 20 females. The authors reported that step length, as a fraction of body height, increased in this sub-group by 0.007 (P &lt; 0.001) of 20 females when the AFO was worn. Comparisons of step length for the original total sample were not reported.There is limited evidence to suggest that static balance and perturbed balance of people with sensory perception loss improves when a semi-flexible plastic sagittal plane AFO is worn; this improvement was greater when visual cues were removed. Evidence to suggest that medial-lateral AFO reduces step-to-step variability and increases step length of people with sensory perception loss is very weak.Limitations of the reviewThe findings of this review were limited because of the small number of studies meeting the inclusion criteria, the poor methodological quality of those studies, the inability to be able to pool the results and the inadequate sample size meaning most studies were underpowered. Moreover, only studies reported in English were included. This may have resulted in the exclusion of studies that were relevant and thus important for this review. Qualitative studies were excluded from the review, and these studies may have been able to contribute to the feasibility aspects of wearing/using the foot and ankle devices.AcknowledgementsJP is funded by a National Institute for Health Research CAT Clinical Lectureship award (CAT/CL10/007).
